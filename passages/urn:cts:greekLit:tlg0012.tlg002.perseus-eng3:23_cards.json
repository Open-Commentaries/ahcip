But now at length has this thy long desire been fulfilled:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>he has come himself, alive to his own hearth, and he has found both thee and his son in the halls; while as for those, even the wooers, who wrought him evil, on them has he taken vengeance one and all in his house.”\n    Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, boast not yet loudly over them with laughter.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"60\" unit=\"line\"/>Thou knowest how welcome the sight of him in the halls would be to all, but above all to me and to his son, born of us two. But this is no true tale, as thou tellest it; nay, some one of the immortals has slain the lordly wooers in wrath at their grievous insolence and their evil deeds.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"65\" unit=\"line\"/>For they honored no one among men upon the earth, were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; therefore it is through their own wanton folly that they have suffered evil.

But when she had come in and had passed over the stone threshold, she sat down opposite Odysseus in the light of the fire<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"90\" unit=\"line\"/>beside the further wall; but he was sitting by a tall pillar, looking down, and waiting to see whether his noble wife would say aught to him, when her eyes beheld him. Howbeit she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul; and now with her eyes she would look full upon his face, and now again<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"95\" unit=\"line\"/>she would fail to know him, for that he had upon him mean raiment. But Telemachus rebuked her, and spoke, and addressed her:\n    “My mother, cruel mother, that hast an unyielding heart, why dost thou thus hold aloof from my father, and dost not sit by his side and ask and question him?<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"100\" unit=\"line\"/>No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband, who after many grievous toils had come back to her in the twentieth year to his native land: but thy heart is ever harder than stone.” \n    Then wise Penelope answered him:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>“My child, the heart in my breast is lost in wonder, and I have no power to speak at all, nor to ask a question, nor to look him in the face. But if in very truth he is Odysseus, and has come home, we two shall surely know one another more certainly;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"110\" unit=\"line\"/>for we have signs which we two alone know, signs hidden from others.”\n    So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus smiled, and straightway spoke to Telemachus winged words:\n    “Telemachus, suffer now thy mother to test me in the halls; presently shall she win more certain knowledge.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"115\" unit=\"line\"/>But now because I am foul, and am clad about my body in mean clothing, she scorns me, and will not yet admit that I am he.

For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even though it be a man that leaves not many behind to avenge him,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"120\" unit=\"line\"/>he goes into exile, and leaves his kindred and his native land; but we have slain those who were the very stay of the city, far the noblest of the youths of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>. Of this I bid thee take thought.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Do thou thyself look to this, dear father; for thy<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>counsel, they say, is the best among men, nor could any other of mortal men vie with thee.

First bathe yourselves, and put on your tunics, and bid the handmaids in the halls to take their raiment. But let the divine minstrel with his clear-toned lyre in hand be our leader in the gladsome dance,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"135\" unit=\"line\"/>that any man who hears the sound from without, whether a passer-by or one of those who dwell around, may say that it is a wedding feast; and so the rumor of the slaying of the wooers shall not be spread abroad throughout the city before we go forth to our well-wooded farm. There<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>shall we afterwards devise whatever advantage the Olympian may vouchsafe us.”\n    So he spoke, and they all readily hearkened and obeyed. First they bathed and put on their tunics, and the women arrayed themselves, and the divine minstrel took the hollow lyre and aroused in them the desire<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>of sweet song and goodly dance. So the great hall resounded all about with the tread of dancing men and of fair-girdled women; and thus would one speak who heard the noise from without the house:\n    “Aye, verily some one has wedded the queen wooed of many.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>Cruel she was, nor had she the heart to keep the great house of her wedded husband to the end, even till he should come.”\n    So they would say, but they knew not how these things were. Meanwhile the housewife Eurynome bathed the great-hearted Odysseus in his house, and anointed him with oil,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>and cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic; and over his head Athena shed abundant beauty, making him taller to look upon and mightier, and from his head she made locks to flow in curls like the hyacinth flower. And as when a man overlays silver with gold,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>a cunning workman whom Hephaestus and Pallas Athena have taught all manner of craft, and full of grace is the work he produces, even so the goddess shed grace on his head and shoulders, and forth from the bath he came, in form like unto the immortals. Then he sat down again on the chair from which he had risen,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"165\" unit=\"line\"/>opposite his wife; and he spoke to her and said:\n    “Strange lady! to thee beyond all women have the dwellers on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband who after many grievous toils<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"170\" unit=\"line\"/>had come to her in the twentieth year to his native land. Nay come, nurse, strew me a couch, that all alone I may lay me down, for verily the heart in her breast is of iron.”\n    Then wise Penelope answered him: “Strange sir, I am neither in any wise proud, nor do I scorn thee,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>nor yet am I too greatly amazed, but right well do I know what manner of man thou wast, when thou wentest forth from <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName> on thy long-oared ship. Yet come, Eurycleia, strew for him the stout bedstead outside the well-built bridal chamber which he made himself.

But Odysseus, in a burst of anger, spoke to his true-hearted wife, and said: “Woman, truly this is a bitter word that thou hast spoken. Who has set my bed elsewhere? Hard would it be for one,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"185\" unit=\"line\"/>though never so skilled, unless a god himself should come and easily by his will set it in another place. But of men there is no mortal that lives, be he never so young and strong, who could easily pry it from its place, for a great token is wrought in the fashioned bed, and it was I that built it and none other.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"190\" unit=\"line\"/>A bush of long-leafed olive was growing within the court, strong and vigorous, and girth it was like a pillar. Round about this I built my chamber, till I had finished it, with close-set stones, and I roofed it over well, and added to it jointed doors, close-fitting.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"195\" unit=\"line\"/>Thereafter I cut away the leafy branches of the long-leafed olive, and, trimming the trunk from the root, I smoothed it around with the adze well and cunningly, and made it straight to the line, thus fashioning the bed-post; and I bored it all with the augur. Beginning with this I hewed out my bed, till I had finished it,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>inlaying it with gold and silver and ivory, and I stretched on it a thong of ox-hide, bright with purple. Thus do I declare to thee this token; but I know not, woman, whether my bedstead is still fast in its place, or whether by now some man has cut from beneath the olive stump, and set the bedstead elsewhere.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted, as she knew the sure tokens which Odysseus told her. Then with a burst of tears she ran straight toward him, and flung her arms about the neck of Odysseus, and kissed his head, and spoke, saying:\n    “Be not vexed with me, Odysseus, for in all else<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"210\" unit=\"line\"/>thou wast ever the wisest of men. It is the gods that gave us sorrow, the gods who begrudged that we two should remain with each other and enjoy our youth, and come to the threshold of old age. But be not now wroth with me for this, nor full of indignation, because at the first, when I saw thee, I did not thus give thee welcome.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>For always the heart in my breast was full of dread, lest some man should come and beguile me with his words; for there are many that plan devices of evil. Nay, even Argive Helen, daughter of Zeus, would not have lain in love with a man of another folk,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>had she known that the warlike sons of the Achaeans were to bring her home again to her dear native land. Yet verily in her case a god prompted her to work a shameful deed; nor until then did she lay up in her mind the thought of that folly, the grievous folly from which at the first sorrow came upon us too.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"225\" unit=\"line\"/>But now, since thou hast told the clear tokens of our bed, which no mortal beside has ever seen save thee and me alone and one single handmaid, the daughter of Actor, whom my father gave me or ever I came hither, even her who kept the doors of our strong bridal chamber,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"230\" unit=\"line\"/>lo, thou dost convince my heart, unbending as it is.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"231"},{"n":"231","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"231\">\n    <p>\n    So she spoke, and in his heart aroused yet more the desire for lamentation; and he wept, holding in his arms his dear and true-hearted wife. And welcome as is the sight of land to men that swim, whose well-built ship Poseidon<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>has smitten on the sea as it was driven on by the wind and the swollen wave, and but few have made their escape from the gray sea to the shore by swimming, and thickly are their bodies crusted with brine, and gladly have they set foot on the land and escaped from their evil case; even so welcome to her was her husband, as she gazed upon him,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"240\" unit=\"line\"/>and from his neck she could in no wise let her white arms go. And now would the rosy-fingered Dawn have arisen upon their weeping, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, taken other counsel. The long night she held back at the end of its course, and likewise stayed the golden-throned Dawn at the streams of Oceanus, and would not suffer her<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"245\" unit=\"line\"/>to yoke her swift-footed horses that bring light to men, Lampus and Phaethon, who are the colts that bear the Dawn. \n    Then to his wife said Odysseus of many wiles: “Wife, we have not yet come to the end of all our trials, but still hereafter there is to be measureless toil,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"250\" unit=\"line\"/>long and hard, which I must fulfil to the end; for so did the spirit of Teiresias foretell to me on the day when I went down into the house of Hades to enquire concerning the return of my comrades and myself. But come, wife, let us to bed, that<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"255\" unit=\"line\"/>lulled now by sweet slumber we may take our joy of rest.”\n    Then wise Penelope answered him: “Thy bed shall be ready for thee whensoever thy heart shall desire it, since the gods have indeed caused thee to come back to thy well-built house and thy native land.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"260\" unit=\"line\"/>But since thou hast bethought thee of this, and a god has put it into thy heart, come, tell me of this trial, for in time to come, methinks, I shall learn of it, and to know it at once is no whit worse.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"263"},{"n":"263","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"263\">\n    <p>\n    And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Strange lady! why dost thou now so urgently bid me<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"265\" unit=\"line\"/>tell thee? Yet I will declare it, and will hide nothing. Verily thy heart shall have no joy of it, even as I myself have none; for Teiresias bade me go forth to full many cities of men, bearing a shapely oar in my hands, till I should come<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"270\" unit=\"line\"/>to men that know naught of the sea, and eat not of food mingled with salt; aye, and they know naught of ships with purple cheeks, or of shapely oars that serve as wings to ships. And he told me this sign, right manifest; nor will I hide it from thee. When another wayfarer, on meeting me,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"275\" unit=\"line\"/>should say that I had a winnowing fan on my stout shoulder, then he bade me fix my oar in the earth, and make goodly offerings to lord Poseidon—a ram and a bull and a boar, that mates with sows—and depart for my home, and offer sacred hecatombs<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"280\" unit=\"line\"/>to the immortal gods, who hold broad heaven, to each one in due order. And death shall come to me myself far from the sea, a death so gentle, that shall lay me low, when I am overcome with sleek old age, and my people shall dwell in prosperity around me. All this, he said, should I see fulfilled.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"285\" unit=\"line\"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: “If verily the gods are to bring about for thee a happier old age, there is hope then that thou wilt find an escape from evil.”\n    Thus they spoke to one another; and meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse made ready the bed<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"290\" unit=\"line\"/>of soft coverlets by the light of blazing torches. But when they had busily spread the stout-built bedstead, the old nurse went back to her chamber to lie down, and Eurynome, the maiden of the bedchamber, led them on their way to the couch with a torch in her hands;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"295\" unit=\"line\"/>and when she had led them to the bridal chamber, she went back. And they then gladly came to the place of the couch that was theirs of old. But Telemachus and the neatherd and the swineherd stayed their feet from dancing, and stayed the women, and themselves lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"300\" unit=\"line\"/>But when the two had had their fill of the joy of love, they took delight in tales, speaking each to the other.
