And this Plan of Zeus, which is the wish or Will of Zeus, will be coextensive with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, starting with the original promise of Zeus to Thetis at the beginning of the epic, at I.01.524–530. What the god had then promised, that he will honor Achilles by letting the Achaeans lose until the fire of Hector reaches their beached ships, had been signaled when Zeus originally nodded his head at I.01.524–530. Now at I.15.075 Zeus refers again to this nodding of his head as he briefly retells the plot or narrative arc extending from the time of inception, which was the time when he had originally nodded. That narrative arc now extends not only to the present time of his retelling but also into a future time that has not yet been narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>: within this time-frame of future events, Poseidon will stop interfering on behalf of the Achaeans, I.15.056–058, and then Hector will be re-energized by Apollo and will thus stop the present momentum of the Achaeans, chasing them back to their beached ships, I.15.059–064, and then Achilles will send out Patroklos to stop the Trojans, I.15.064–065, and then Patroklos will be killed by Hector, I.15.065—but not before Patroklos himself kills many heroes fighting on the Trojan side, I.15.066–067, and among those killed heroes will be Sarpedon, who is the son of Zeus himself, I.15.067—and then, to top it all off, Achilles will experience anger [<em>kholos</em>] over the killing of Patroklos by Hector and will kill Hector, I.15.068. In the course of this almost breathlessly rapid retelling of the plot by Zeus, the foretelling of events yet to happen touches on the upcoming drama of the god’s personal loss of Sarpedon, who is his own human son. But the drama of this divine loss is still being elided for the moment, since Zeus at present is saying only that Sarpedon will be killed by Patroklos. The god is not yet saying that Sarpedon is his own beloved son. But that is not all. All has not yet been retold, even at this point, at I.15.068, which signals the killing of Hector by Achilles. The god’s retelling of the plot in the form of a foretelling is not yet completed at this point. The retelling by Zeus continues even further, starting with I.15.069: after Achilles kills Hector, Zeus will plan to bring about a reversal for the Trojans, who will now be driven back from the beached ships that they had threatened to destroy under Hector’s leadership, and the story of this <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’, I.15.069, is described in the god’s wording as if it were some kind of an artifact that Zeus himself has fashioned in the mode of an artisan: the key word is <em>teukhein</em> ‘make-as-an-artisan’ (τεύχοιμι), I.15.070, which takes the noun <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’ as its direct object, I.15.069. After this story of the <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’, fashioned by Zeus in the mode of some divine artisan who creates the story by narrating the story, there will be a relentlessly consequential narrative that will lead all the way to the very end, which is, the destruction of Troy, I.15.070–071. This ending, however, extends beyond the time-frame that will be narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>. And such an ending, perhaps surprisingly, is said by Zeus to result from the <em>boulai</em> ‘plans’ of the god’s divine daughter, the goddess Athena, I.15.071 (Ἀθηναίης διὰ βουλάς). Why does Zeus speak here about the plans of Athena, as if they were not his own plans? It is because the plans of the goddess are by implication coextensive with the plans of her divine father as well. But Zeus is not yet finished with the announcement of his plan. Having indicated the outer limit of the epic plotline, which is the destruction of Troy at I.15.071, Zeus now returns to the present, indicating how it will extend into the immediate future of the <em>Iliad</em>. I will not cease my anger [<em>kholos</em>] against the Achaeans, the god declares at I.15.072, and I will not let any other god intervene on their behalf, I.15.073, until the wish of Achilles is fulfilled, I.15.074. That wish, as we already know, is that the Achaeans will keep losing until the fire of Hector reaches their beached ships. But Zeus here does not repeat the wording of that wish, even though he has promised to make the wish happen. Instead, he simply declares that he had made for Achilles a promise by way of nodding his divine head, I.15.075, and that this promise had been formulated for him by Thetis, the mother of Achilles, I.15.076–077. What Zeus had promised, the god says, was that Achilles should be ‘given honor’, as expressed by the verb <em>tīmân</em>, I.15.077 (τιμῆσαι).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:15.56-15.77","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Will of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Plan of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"plot of the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"narrative arc"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"boulē 'wish,plan'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.132227","title":"Iliad 15.59–15.60","body":"<p>The god Apollo is about to be engaged here in the act of <em>en-pneîn</em> ‘breathing into’ the hero Hector something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’, I.15.060.

These verses containing the words of Hector, I.15.494–499, are quoted in a speech delivered by the Athenian statesman Lycurgus, <em>Against Leokrates</em> (103). The context is this: Lycurgus is arguing that the beautiful death foreseen by Hector, his <em>belle mort</em>, can be pictured as a model for Athenians when they contemplate the possibility that they too will die when they fight their wars. Lycurgus refers to the willingness of Athenian citizens to die in war not only for their own <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ but also for all of Hellas as a <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 104). Lycurgus invokes as his prime example the <em>belle mort</em> of the Athenian citizen-warriors who fought at Marathon and who thereby won for Hellas a freedom from terror, an <em>adeia</em> ‘security’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (104). The Athenian statesman is making this reference to the interests of Athens in the context of actually quoting the words of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em>, who says that he is willing to die for his fatherland in order to protect it against the Achaeans (Lycurgus <em>Against Leokrates</em> 103 lines 4–9). These heroic words of Hector correspond to I.15.494–499 here, and Lycurgus quotes them in the larger context of saying that the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, as performed at the quadrennial Athenian festival of the Panathenaia, are the ancestral heritage of the Athenians and the primary source of their education as citizen-warriors (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 102).

In the case of Herakles, for example, the theme of <em>bíē</em> is actually embodied in the hero's identity, since he is conventionally named not only as <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> but also as <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em>, as here (βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ). The fact that a full declension of this periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs </em>is attested in the diction of archaic hexameter poetry is itself striking evidence, on the level of form, that the Herakles figure and <em>bíē</em> are traditionally linked on the level of theme. Since the very name <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> 'he who has the <em>kléos</em> of Hera' embodies the them of glory <em>through epic</em>, the tradition combination of <em>bíē</em><em> </em>with <em>kléos</em> in the periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em> is a formal indication that <em>bíē</em> is a traditional epic theme. The heroic resource of <em>bíē</em>, then, has a distinctly positive aspect as a key to the hero's <em>kléos</em>. Nevertheless, it has a disquieting negative aspect as well, as in the case of the <em>Odyssey</em>, where Odysseus uses <em>bíē</em><em> </em>to kill the suitors and the overall behavior of the suitors themselves is also characterized as <em>bíē </em>(e.g., O.23.031). </p><p>See also I.02.658, I.02.666, I.04.386, I.05.638, I.11.690, and I.19.098.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:15.640","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"kleos 'glory'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"bíē Hēraklēeíē ‘force of Hēraklēs’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.136624","title":"Iliad 15.696–746","body":"<p>Here at last begins the final push made by the Trojans in the Battle for the Ships—before Patroklos enters the fighting.

What follows is an epitome of further analysis from Nagy 2011c:193. In the course of leading the attack, Hector grabs hold of the <em>prumnē</em> ‘stern’ of one of the beached ships—the ship that had belonged to the hero Protesilaos, I.15.705–706, who was first of the Achaeans to be killed at Troy. On Protesilaos, see the earlier comment on I.02.695–709 and I.13.681, also the later comment below on I.15.704–706. Holding on to the <em>prumnē</em> ‘stern’ of this ship, I.15.716, Hector now shouts to his fellow Trojans and calls on them to bring him fire so that he may set this specially prized ship ablaze, I.15.718. In this context, Hector describes himself as fighting next to the <em>prumnai</em> ‘sterns’of the ships, I.15.722, which had been pulled ashore with their backs facing away from the sea and facing toward the attacking Trojans, I.15.718–725. The view of the narrative now shifts to Ajax, who is shown to be unable to hold off the attacking Trojans any longer, I.15.727: Αἴας δ’ οὐκέτ’ ἔμιμνε ‘Ajax could not hold them off any longer’. Now Ajax makes a strategic partial withdrawal, I.15.728, stepping off the <em>ikria</em> ‘deck’ of the ship of Protesilaos, I.15.729, which is where he had been standing, I.15.730. So, Ajax now fights on a lower level, I.15.729, and from further back inside the ship, I.15.728, but at least he continues to fight back, I.15.743–746, encouraging his fellow Achaeans to fight back as well I.15.732, and his words of encouragement, as quoted at I.15.733–741, are uttered in the form of a ritual shout, as expressed by the verb <em>boân</em> I.15.732. The focusing at I.15.696–746 on the stern of the ship of Protesilaos will become an essential narrative link in later phases of the narration about the Battle of the Ships. Already at I.15.704–706, Hector’s action in grabbing the stern of the ship of Protesilaos signals a tipping point: the defenses of the Achaeans, especially as represented by Ajax, are about to fail. In Bacchylides Ode 13.105–108, on the other hand, there is a reference to an alternative epic tradition about the role of Ajax. In this version, Ajax stands his ground on the stern of the beached ship: |105 ὅστ’ ἐπὶ πρύμναι σταθ[εὶς] |106 ἔσχεν θρασυκάρδιον [ὁρ]|107 μαίνοντα ν[ᾶας]|108 θεσπεσίωι πυ[ρὶ ––]| ‘(Ajax,) the one who, standing on the stern of the ship, held off Hector of the bold heart.
