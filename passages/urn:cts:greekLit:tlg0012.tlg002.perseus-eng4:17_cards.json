When they had got over the\n    rough steep ground and were nearing the city, they reached the fountain from\n    which the citizens drew their water.

Here Melanthios son of Dolios overtook them as he was\n    driving down some goats, the best in his flock, for the suitors’ dinner, and\n    there were two shepherds with him.

As soon as he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his ears and\n    wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master.

Then Zeus spread panic\n    among my men, and they would no longer face the enemy, for they found\n    themselves surrounded.
