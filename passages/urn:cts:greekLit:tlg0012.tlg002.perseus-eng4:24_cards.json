Odysseus had been\n    long gone, and we were courting his wife, who did not say point blank that she\n    would not marry, nor yet bring matters to an end, for she meant to compass our\n    destruction: this, then, was the trick she played us. She set up a great\n    tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine\n    needlework. ‘Sweethearts,’ said she, ‘Odysseus is indeed dead, still, do not\n    press me to marry again immediately; wait - for I would not have my skill in\n    needlework perish unrecorded - till I have completed a shroud for the hero\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, against the time when\n    death shall take him. He is very rich, and the women of the <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term> will talk if he is laid out without a shroud.’\n    This is what she said, and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon\n    her great web all day long, but at night she would unpick the stitches again by\n    torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without our finding it\n    out, but as time [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôra</term>] wore on and she was now in\n    her fourth year, and the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished,\n    one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us, and we caught her in the\n    act of undoing her work, so she had to finish it whether she would or not; and\n    when she showed us the robe she had made, after she had had it washed, its\n    splendor was as that of the sun or moon.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"149\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Then some malicious <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> conveyed Odysseus to the upland farm where his swineherd\n    lives. Thither presently came also his son, returning from a voyage to\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Pylos\">Pylos</placeName>, and the two came to the\n    town when they had hatched their plot for our destruction. Telemakhos came\n    first, and then after him, accompanied by the swineherd, came Odysseus, clad in\n    rags and leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He\n    came so unexpectedly that none of us knew him, not even the older ones among\n    us, and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being struck\n    and insulted without a word, though he was in his own house; but when the will\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] of Aegis-bearing Zeus inspired him, he\n    and Telemakhos took the armor and hid it in an inner chamber, bolting the doors\n    behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a quantity of\n    iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this was the beginning of\n    our end, for not one of us could string the bow - nor nearly do so. When it was\n    about to reach the hands of Odysseus, we all of us shouted out that it should\n    not be given him, no matter what he might say, but Telemakhos insisted on his\n    having it. When he had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his\n    arrow through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the room and poured his\n    arrows on the ground, glaring fiercely about him. First he killed Antinoos, and\n    then, aiming straight before him, he let fly his deadly darts and they fell\n    thick on one another. It was plain that some one of the gods was helping them,\n    for they fell upon us with might and main throughout the cloisters, and there\n    was a hideous sound of groaning as our brains were being battered in, and the\n    ground seethed with our blood. This, Agamemnon, is how we came by our end, and\n    our bodies are lying still un-cared for in the house of Odysseus, for our\n    friends at home do not yet know what has happened, so that they cannot lay us\n    out and wash the black blood from our wounds, making moan over us according to\n    the offices due to the departed.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"191\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Happy Odysseus, son of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>,\" replied the ghost [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of Agamemnon, \"you are indeed blessed [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">olbios</term>] in the possession of a wife endowed with such\n    rare excellence [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aretê</term>] of understanding, and so\n    faithful to her wedded lord as Penelope the daughter of Ikarios.

He had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs\n    were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he\n    also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was\n    looking very woe-begone [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>]. When Odysseus\n    saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>], he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He\n    doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having\n    come home, or whether he should first question him and see what he would say.\n    In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him, so in this mind he went up\n    to his father, who was bending down and digging about a plant.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"244\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I see, sir,\" said Odysseus, \"that you are an\n    excellent gardener - what pains you take with it, to be sure.

They then met angrily in the place of assembly,\n    and when they were got together Eupeithes rose to speak. He was overwhelmed\n    with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>] for the death of his son\n    Antinoos, who had been the first man killed by Odysseus, so he said, weeping\n    bitterly, \"My friend, this man has done the Achaeans great wrong. He took many\n    of our best men away with him in his fleet, and he has lost both ships and men;\n    now, moreover, on his return he has been killing all the foremost men among the\n    Cephallênians.

Every one was astonished at seeing them, but they stood in the\n    middle of the assembly, and Medon said, \"Hear me, men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>. Odysseus did not do these things\n    against the will of heaven. I myself saw an immortal god take the form of\n    Mentor and stand beside him.

Now, however, let it be as I say, and do as\n    I tell you.

He thought he was going to avenge the murder of his son,\n    whereas in truth he was never to return, but was himself to perish in his\n    attempt.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"472\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Athena said to Zeus, \"Father, son of\n    Kronos, king of kings, answer me this question - What does your <term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term> bid you?

He hit\n    Eupeithes’ helmet, and the spear went right through it, for the helmet stayed\n    it not, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\n    Meantime Odysseus and his son fell the front line of the foe and smote them\n    with their swords and spears; indeed, they would have killed every one of them,\n    and prevented them from ever getting home again, only Athena raised her voice\n    aloud, and made every one pause. \"Men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>,\" she cried, \"cease this dreadful war, and settle the\n    matter at once without further bloodshed.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"533\" unit=\"line\"/>On this pale fear seized every one; they were\n    so frightened that their arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground\n    at the sound of the goddess’ voice, and they fled back to the city for their\n    lives.
