See the comment on I.22.506–507 with reference to the the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, which means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’.

We join the action as Telemachus and his traveling companion, the young hero Peisistratos, son of Nestor, are both being escorted into the palace of Menelaos and Helen:</p><p>|43 αὐτοὺς δ’ εἰσῆγον θεῖον δόμον. οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες |44 θαύμαζον κατὰ δῶμα διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος· |45 ὥς τε γὰρ ἠελίου αἴγλη πέλεν ἠὲ σελήνης |46 δῶμα καθ’ ὑψερεφὲς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. |47 αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν . . .</p><p>|43 They were escorted inside the heavenly [<em>theion</em>] palace.

And now the dinner conversation gets underway, starting with words of appreciation spoken by Telemachus and intended for Menelaos. Telemachus speaks here as a grateful guest, addressing his fellow guest Peisistratos, son of Nestor, but his words are really intended for Menelaos as the generous host. I will now quote these words of Telemachus as spoken to the son of Nestor—words that not only compliment Menelaos but also express most sincerely the young guest’s awestruck reaction to the splendor of the king’s palace:</p><p>|71 “φράζεο, Νεστορίδη, τῷ ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ, |72 χαλκοῦ τε στεροπὴν κατὰ δώματα ἠχήεντα |73 χρυσοῦ τ’ ἠλέκτρου τε καὶ ἀργύρου ἠδ’ ἐλέφαντος. |74 Ζηνός που τοιήδε γ’ Ὀλυμπίου ἔνδοθεν αὐλή, |75 ὅσσα τάδ’ ἄσπετα πολλά· σέβας μ’ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.”</p><p>|71 “I want you to notice something, son of Nestor, you who are so dear to my heart: |72 notice the flash [<em>steropē</em>] of bronze [<em>khalkos</em>] as its light pervades the echoing hall |73 and also the flash of gold and of electrum and of silver and of ivory. |74 I’m guessing that Zeus, who lives on Olympus, has such a hall inside his palace, |75 and he would have as many indescribable things as are here. A sense of holy awe [<em>sebas</em>] takes hold of me as I look at these things.”</p><p>O.04.071–075</p><p>[§3] What first catches the young man’s eye here is all the shining bronze he sees. And then it’s the gold, then the electrum, then the silver, and finally the ivory. But the first impression is the bronze, all that bronze. The light that he sees streaming from the bronze envelops everything with its radiance, and it’s just like heaven for the young man.</p><p>[§4] “Thought I’d died and gone to heaven.” The colloquial saying that I just quoted, which has become the title of a popular song recorded in 1991 by Bryan Adams, captures the young man’s awareness that he has just experienced something celestial. The reduced theology of this kind of imagined heaven resembles the celestial realm of the ancient Greek gods. Their ‘sky’ or <em>ouranos</em>, as we read at I.17.425, is traditionally visualized as ‘made of bronze’, <em>khalkeos</em> (χάλκεον οὐρανόν). This expression shows its own special kind of reduced theology: from out of the sky, when it’s bright, the gleam of a mighty bronze dome envelops everything on earth. Presiding over this bronze dome is the god Zeus, whose heavenly residence is called the <em>khalkobates dō</em>, ‘the palace with floor made of bronze’ (χαλκοβατὲς δῶ), I.01.426; I.14.173, I.21.438, I.21.505, O.08.321—a residence situated high above Mount Olympus, I.01.426, I.21.438, I.21.505. As we will see at O.07.084–090, the heavenly residence of Menelaos is comparable to the palace of Alkinoos (latinized as Alcinous), king of the Phaeacians. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:4.43-4.75","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"palace of Menelaos and Helen"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"heavenly bronze"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.200001","title":"Odyssey 4.93-116","body":"<p>Menelaos laments here the sorrows of the Trojan War, O.04.093–112, and Telemachus responds by weeping, O.04.113–116.

But, because it [= this story] was not as appropriate for epic composition as was the other one [= the other story] that he used, he omitted it, though he made it clear that he was aware of this story [= the story of Helen in Egypt] as well. It is clear on the basis of the way he composed in the <em>Iliad</em> (and nowhere else has he [= Homer] retraced his steps to this) the detour of Alexandros [= Paris]—how he [= Paris], as he was bringing Helen, was blown off course and was detoured in various places and then how he reached Sidon in Phoenicia. He [= Homer] mentions the story [of Helen in Egypt] in the part about the greatest deeds of Diomedes. And the epic words he says are as follows. </p><p>There they were, the <em>peploi</em>, completely pattern-woven [<em>poikiloi</em>], the work of women</p><p>from Sidon, whom Alexandros [= Paris] himself, the godlike, </p><p>had brought home [to Troy] from the land of Sidon, sailing over the vast sea, </p><p>on the very same journey as the one he took when he brought back home [to Troy] also Helen, the one who is descended from the most noble father.</p><p>[I.06.289–292] </p><p>He [= Homer] mentions it [= the story of Helen in Egypt] in the <em>Odyssey</em> also, in these epic words: </p><p>Such magical things she had, the daughter of Zeus,</p><p>things of good outcome, which to her did Polydamna give, wife of Thon.</p><p>She was Egyptian. For her, many were the things produced by the life-giving earth,</p><p>magical things—many good mixtures and many baneful ones.</p><p>[O.04.227–230] </p><p>And these other things are said to Telemachus by Menelaos: </p><p>I was eager to return here, but the gods still held me in Egypt,</p><p>Since I had not sacrificed entire hecatombs [<em>hekatombai</em>] to them. </p><p>[O.04.351–352] </p><p>In these epic verses the Poet makes clear that he knew of the detour of Alexandros [= Paris] to Egypt; for Syria borders on Egypt, and the Phoenicians whose territory is Sidon dwell in Syria. In terms of these epic verses, this shows most clearly that the epic of the <em>Cypria</em> is not by Homer but by someone else. For in the <em>Cypria</em> it is said that on the third day after setting sail from Sparta Alexandros [= Paris] arrived in Troy bringing Helen, having made good use of a favorable wind and smooth seas. In the <em>Iliad</em>, on the other hand, he [= Homer] says that he [= Paris] was detoured as he was bringing her [= Helen]. So much for Homer and the epic of the <em>Cypria</em>. </p><p>(A note on Herodotus 2.116.4–5.) I question the judgment of modern editors who bracket sections 4 and 5 of Herodotus 2.116. Granted, the topic in these sections is the detour of Menelaos and Helen in Egypt after the war at Troy, not the detour of Paris and Helen before the war. But these passages are relevant to what Herodotus says thereafter (2.118–119) about Helen in Egypt after the war. Herodotus is making the point that there are other Homeric stories about Helen in Egypt, whereas there are no other Homeric stories about Helen in Phoenicia.</p><p>I now offer a paraphrase of the arguments made by Herodotus here at 2.116.1–2.117.1:</p><p>In a non-Homeric version of an epic called the <em>Cypria</em> (a version known to Herodotus but not to us), it is said that Paris and Helen sailed to Troy without making any detour. There is an alternative version in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, and Herodotus quotes the relevant verses. In this version, it is said that Paris and Helen did make a detour: they went to Phoenicia before they went to Troy. On the basis of an Egyptian story about Paris and Helen, Herodotus goes on to argue that they went to Egypt as well as Phoenicia, and that Homer knew it. After all, Egypt is next to Phoenicia. But the problem is, Homer later elided the story of Helen in Egypt as inappropriate. So the <em>Iliad</em> tells the story about Helen in Troy, not the story about Helen in Egypt. And the <em>Odyssey</em> follows the <em>Iliad</em> in accepting the story of Helen in Troy. Both epics, however, show traces of the story of Helen in Egypt, though the traces in the <em>Iliad</em> are only indirect. </p><p>Next, I offer a critical analysis of this paraphrase:</p><p>Herodotus considers the stories about detours in Egypt and Phoenicia within the larger context of stories about Helen in Egypt. Upon retelling an Egyptian version of a story about a detour of Paris and Helen in Egypt after he abducted her from Sparta (2.112–115), Herodotus says that Homer must have known that story (2.116.1). Then, in order to show that this is so, Herodotus offers proof (2.116–117), quoting I.06.289–292 and O.04.227–230 together with O.04.351–352. The passage I.06.289–292 concerns the detour of Paris and Helen before the war at Troy while the passages O.04.227–230 and O.04.351–352 concern the detour of Menelaos and Helen after the war. The first passage is meant as indirect proof that the story of Helen in Egypt was recognized by Homer in the <em>Iliad</em> while the other two passages are meant as direct proof that the story of Helen in Egypt was recognized by Homer in the <em>Odyssey</em>. The passages from the <em>Odyssey</em> are relevant to what Herodotus goes on to argue about the story of Helen in Egypt: he finds that this story is more believable than the story of Helen in Troy (2.118–119). In the Egyptian version, Paris is forced to leave Helen behind in Egypt after the two of them are detoured there (2.115.5). That is where Menelaos finds her after the war. According to this Egyptian version, then, Helen never went to Troy. For Herodotus, this version makes more sense than the Homeric version that dominates the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. </p><p>I conclude by considering again the fact that Herodotus distinguishes Homer as the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> from the poet of the <em>Cypria</em>. This fact shows that the historian is familiar with the Panathenaic Homer. That is, he thinks of Homer as the poet of the two epics performed at the Panathenaia, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. Nevertheless, Herodotus does not presuppose that everyone thinks this way. That is why he makes a point of establishing the distinction in the first place. He speaks of the poet of the <em>Cypria</em> as someone who may be considered to be Homer by others, but Herodotus knows better. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:4.227-4.230","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"a sojourn of Helen in Egypt"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.200503","title":"Odyssey 4.227","body":"<p>The application of this epithet ‘daughter of Zeus’ to Helen is an overt reference to her divinity. On the use of <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ as an epithet for goddesses, see the anchor comment at I.03.374. For more on the divinity of Helen, I epitomize from Nagy 2016.05.02 §§0–4: </p><p>[§0]The picturing of Helen as a ‘daughter of Zeus’ here at O.04.227 is a most fitting description of a goddess who was already worshipped at Sparta in an era as early as the second half of the second millennium BCE—an era that marks the rise and the eventual fall of an early Greek civilization that archaeologists recognize as the Mycenaean Empire. But there is a problem with this picture: how do we square the idea of Helen as goddess of Sparta with the idea of Helen of Troy as we see her come to life in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>? I hope to address this problem here by taking a second look at the idea of Helen’s ‘image-double’, the word for which in Greek was <em>eidōlon</em>. </p><p>[§1] Helen of Troy, as we know her in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, appears to be a woman, not a goddess. But the remarkable fact is—I spotlight its relevance from the start—that the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em> describes Helen here at O.04.227 by way of the epithet <em>Dios thugatēr</em>, which means ‘daughter of Zeus’. And I spotlight here another relevant fact that is even more remarkable: the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> describes Helen as <em>Dios ekgegauia</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ at I.03.199, I.03.418, and the same epithet occurs also at O.04.184, O.04.219, O.23.218. But the most remarkable relevant fact of them all is that <em>Dios thugatēr</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, as we see this epithet deployed elsewhere not only in the <em>Iliad</em> but also in the <em>Odyssey</em>, can be used only with reference to goddesses: Aphrodite at I.03.374 and I.05.131 and I.05.312, Athena at I.02.548 and I.04.128 and I.04.515, Artemis at O.20.061, Persephone at O.11.217, Ate at I.19.091, and the Muses at I.02.491–492 (plural) and O.01.010 (singular). These and other facts to be brought up later lead me to argue that, although Helen appears to be a woman and not a goddess in the <em>Iliad</em>, she is still a goddess. And I argue further that, despite appearances as poetically created in the <em>Iliad</em>, Helen is recognized even there as a goddess. In terms of my argument, then, Helen is recognized as a goddess not only in Sparta but also in the Troy or ‘Ilion’ of the <em>Iliad</em>, the name of which epic means of course ‘the song of Ilion’. And she is a goddess in ‘the song of Ilion’ precisely because she is Helen of Sparta.</p><p>[§2] Someone may object that, even if it is a fact that you have Zeus as your father, this fact alone is not enough to make you a goddess or a god. Your mother must also be a goddess. In other words, you have to have two divine immortals as your biological parents in order to be worshipped as an immortal divinity in your own right. After all, as I myself have argued in H24H 0§5, the dominant gene in the genetic code of ancient Greek mythmaking is mortality while the recessive gene is immortality, not the other way around. In other words, if the family tree that produced you includes even one solitary mortal ancestor, that will be enough to make you mortal as well—no matter how many immortal ancestors grace your genealogy. So, what about Helen’s mother in Sparta? If she were a goddess, then the status of Helen as a goddess in her own right would be a given.</p><p>[§3] In one version of the surviving myths about Helen, the mother of Helen is in fact a goddess, named Nemesis (Cypria fragment 7 ed. Allen, by way of Athenaeus 8.334b–d). In terms of this version, then, there is no question about the divinity of Helen. But things are more complicated. There are also other versions, native even to Sparta, where the mother of Helen is not Nemesis but Leda, as we read in the wording of a Spartan song dramatized by Aristophanes in the <em>Lysistrata</em> (line 1314). And this Leda, as we are about to see, is a mortal woman who is impregnated by Zeus. So, I am faced with a problem here. In terms of my own argumentation concerning mortality as the dominant gene, as it were, I should expect the mortality of Leda as mother to undo the divinity of Helen as daughter of Zeus. In other words, even the paternity of immortal Zeus would not be enough to cancel the mortality of a mortal mother.</p><p>[§4] But Leda is no ordinary mortal mother, since her impregnation by Zeus produces not only Helen but also two sons who are twins, commonly known in English by their Latin names Castor and Pollux—<em>Kastōr</em> and <em>Poludeukēs</em> in the original Greek—who are also known as the Dioskouroi, meaning ‘sons of Zeus’ in Greek. See the comment on I.03.237. I argue that the mythological identity of Helen as a goddess at Sparta can best be understood by contemplating the mythological identity of these two brothers of hers, the Dioskouroi. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:4.227","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Helen as Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios ‘daughter of Zeus’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.200557","title":"Odyssey 4.238-243","body":"<p>Helen presents her story about the sorrows of the Trojan War as an entertainment, marked by the the programmatic word <em>terpesthai</em> ‘feel delight’, O.04.239.

And now in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, we get to know more about the adventures of Agamemnon and Menelaos after Troy, but here it is Menelaos himself who is telling tales about these adventures, and, in his tale, there is a detail about Lesbos that contradicts the tale told by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3. </p><p>Here I epitomize from Nagy 2015 §§ 77–78:</p><p>[§77] While telling his tale to Telemachus in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, Menelaos expresses a wish that the young man’s father, Odysseus, will return to Ithaca and will defeat the suitors of Penelope—just as this hero of the <em>Odyssey</em> had once upon a time defeated an opponent named Philomeleides in a wrestling match that had taken place on the island of Lesbos, O.04.341–344. The verses here at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.341–344 are repeated at 17.132–135, where Telemachus retells to Penelope the story told to him by Menelaos.</p><p>[§78] In terms of what Menelaos says at O.04.341–344, he was in Lesbos when Odysseus performed his heroic feat there. There is some agreement here with the narrative of Nestor at O.03.168–169, who says that Menelaos had sailed from Tenedos to Lesbos. So too had Nestor himself and Diomedes sailed to Lesbos, and they were already there by the time Menelaos arrived. See the comment on O.03.168–169. But the problem is, Odysseus himself did not sail from Tenedos to Lesbos in the narrative of Nestor: rather, as we saw at O.03.160–169, Odysseus together with a sub-group of Achaean followers had already sailed from Tenedos back to Troy in order to rejoin Agamemnon, who was still there at Troy, O.03.160–164, while Nestor and Diomedes together with their Achaean followers sailed on from their stopover at the island of Tenedos and arrived at the next stopover, which was the island of Lesbos, O.03.165–169. There, at Lesbos, Nestor and Diomedes were joined by Menelaos, who as we saw <em>arrived later</em>, O.03.168–169. In short, the parting of ways for Odysseus in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 had already happened on the island of Tenedos, when he had left Nestor and Diomedes and Menelaos in order to rejoin Agamemnon. Here in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, by contrast, Odysseus seems to be still present in Lesbos when Diomedes and Nestor and Menelaos are present in Lesbos. And that is how Menelaos could have witnessed the victory of Odysseus in a wrestling match at Lesbos.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:4.341-4.344","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"tales about the island of Lesbos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.200918","title":"Odyssey 4.343-344/ anchor comment on: two variant myths in Odyssey 3 and Odyssey 4, part 2","body":"<p>Epitome from Nagy 2015§§79–91:</p><p>[§79] I argue that there were two variant myths at work in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and 4, and that these myths could never be completely reconciled with one another. Nor, as I also argue, did they ever really need to be reconciled. In Homeric poetry, there is a built-in awareness of mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking, and there are many examples where the poetry shows this awareness by ostentatiously including, without overt self-contradiction, details from recessive as well as dominant versions of any given myth. For another example, see the anchor comment at O.04.512–522 on: mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking.</p><p>[§80] Keeping in mind the Homeric capacity to track such mutually contradictory local variations, let us consider the myth, as we saw it at work in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, about a grand sacrifice that took place on the island of Tenedos, O.03.159. Of the two Sons of Atreus, only Menelaos was present, while Agamemnon had stayed behind at Troy and was arranging a correspondingly grand sacrifice back there, to be attended by his half of the Achaeans—and that sacrifice was intended for Athena, Ο.03.143–145. As for the sacrifice at Tenedos, the divine recipients are not named, O.03.159. And, at the competing sacrifice on the island of Tenedos, arranged by Menelaos and attended by his half of the Achaeans, a quarrel broke out between Nestor and Odysseus, with the result that Odysseus and his followers went back to Agamemnon, O.03.160–164. After Tenedos, the only Achaean leaders who sailed on homeward with their followers were Nestor and Diomedes, O.03.165–167—to be joined later by Menelaos at Lesbos, O.03.168. </p><p>[§81] From here on, I refer to this ‘Tenedos version’ of the myth, O.03.159–164, as Myth One. But there is also a Myth Two, which is the ‘Lesbos version’, O.04.341–344. According to Myth Two, as we see it at work under the surface in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, <em>there was a grand sacrifice that took place on the island of Lesbos</em>, not on the island of Tenedos. At Lesbos, Odysseus was still together with Nestor and Diomedes—to be joined later by Menelaos. Unlike Myth One as we read it at O.03.159–164, which is a myth originating from Tenedos, this second variant myth originates from Lesbos. A signature of this Myth Two at O.04.341–344 is the reference, initiated by the speaking persona of Menelaos, to that primal wrestling match between Odysseus and Philomeleides on the island of Lesbos. In fact, there are traces of this Myth Two in sources external to Homeric poetry. As we learn from Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGH 4 F 150), the people of Lesbos had their own local stories about Philomeleides: he had been a king of theirs in the age of heroes, and he used to challenge visitors to engage with him in a wrestling match—but then his reputation for invincibility was undone by Odysseus, helped by Diomedes, when these heroes visited Lesbos. On Philomeleides of Lesbos, I have more to say in Nagy 2008:57. </p><p>[§82] I have so far left out a further detail in Myth Two as I have reconstructed it. According to this myth, which would be compatible with the myth as we see it at work in Song 17 of Sappho, Menelaos was not the only one of the two Sons of Atreus who visited Lesbos. <em>Also visiting was his brother Agamemnon</em>. </p><p>[§83] We have already seen that Myth One, compatible with the mythological traditions of Tenedos, situates the quarrel between Menelaos and Agamemnon at Troy, even before Agamemnon arranges for a sacrifice of one hundred cattle there. But now I argue that Myth Two, compatible with the mythological traditions of Lesbos, situates the quarrel of Menelaos and Agamemnon not at Troy—and certainly not at Tenedos—but rather at Lesbos. In Myth Two, as we are about to see, both Sons of Atreus visited Lesbos, and they quarreled there with each other. Further, we will see that such a quarrel between Menelaos and Agamemnon at Lesbos happened not before but after a grand sacrifice of one hundred cattle there. And, even further, we will see that the quarrel was linked with the ultimate failure of that sacrifice. </p><p>[§84] Here we return to Song 17 of Sappho, the relevant parts of which are quoted in the anchor comment at O.03.130–183 on two variant myths in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and <em>Odyssey</em> 4, part 1 at §75. The clearest sign of failure, in terms of the narrative embedded in Song 17 of Sappho, is the wish that we see being formulated in heroic times—when it was announced-in-prayer that a festival is to be arranged at Lesbos. The <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]) that was <em>arātā</em> ‘announced-in-prayer’ (3: ἀράταν)—in the context of an animal sacrifice, as I reconstruct it—was instituted in hopes of ‘finding the way’ back home from Troy (7: [ὄ]δ̣ο̣ν … εὔρη̣[ν]). Hera, as the primary divinity to whom it was announced-in-prayer that there would be a seasonally recurring festival at Lesbos, would be heeding the Sons of Atreus, who had prayed to her, imploring her to <em>help them find their way back home safe and sound.</em> </p><p>[§85] But the question remains: did Hera heed the prayer of the Sons of Atreus? In the mythical world of heroes, a wish expressed by a hero who makes an announcement-in-prayer to a divinity is often not heeded by the divinity. See the anchor comment at I.02.402–429 on prayers heeded or not heeded by gods; also the comment on I.04.118–121. </p><p>[§86] Similarly, in terms of my reconstruction of the announcement-in-prayer made by the Sons of Atreus in Song 17 of Sappho, the sacrifice that was announced-in-prayer by these heroes was a failure, since their wish to find the safest way back home was not granted to either one of them. In the case of Agamemnon, we will see that he was killed after having sailed home safely, O.04.514–537. As for Menelaos, he will be sailing around aimlessly for eight years before he finally finds his way back home. At least, that is what we read in the version of the story as told at O.04.082 (see [§98] below). </p><p>[§87] Before I can proceed with my reconstruction, I must first situate its relevance to Song 17 of Sappho. In this song, I argue, we see a reference to a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in the precinct of Hera at Lesbos, and this sacrifice is viewed, I also argue, as a failed ritual in the heroic past of a myth. In the myth, there is an announcement-in-prayer about performing the sacrifice, which will turn out to be a failure, whereas the seasonal reperforming of this sacrifice at the same place during the festival of Hera is expected to be <em>a successful ritual in the present time of reperformance</em> as signaled in the song. In Song 17, as we have already seen (§75), the persona of Sappho is praying to Hera herself, speaking to her about the <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]) that is being arranged in honor of the goddess. The speaking Sappho goes on to say that this festival, which ‘we’ in the present are arranging (11: πόημεν) as ‘we’ offer supplications to Hera, is being arranged ‘in accordance with the ancient way’ (12: κὰτ τὸ πάλ̣[αιον) of celebration. In terms of the reading that we find in the papyrus, both Agamemnon and Menelaos had arranged (3: π̣ό̣ηϲαν) such a festival in ancient times by virtue of having <em>announced-in-prayer the arrangement of such a festival</em> in the first place. These conquerors of Troy needed to offer their prayer to Hera, Zeus, and Dionysus (9-10), and, in that prayer, they were to announce the arrangement of the <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]), which was thus <em>arātā</em> ‘announced-in-prayer (3: ἀράταν). It is at this festival that the persona of Sappho is ‘even now’ praying to Hera, <em>nun de</em> (11). And, in terms of my reconstruction, I argue that the centerpiece of such a seasonally recurring festival at Lesbos was a <em>hecatomb</em>, that is, the sacrificial slaughter of one hundred cattle. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, see the comment on O.04.351–353.</p><p>[§88] So, the central question is this: if such a ritual of sacrificing one hundred cattle was a failure in the past time of the myth, how could it become a model for the success of that ritual as it exists in its own present time? </p><p>[§89] Such an idea of failure in myth and success in ritual is typical of an <em>aetiology</em>. I repeat here my working definition (see the comment on I.23.01–064 Point 1): <em>an aetiology focuses on a foundational catastrophe in the mythologized past that explains and thus motivates continuing success in the ritualized present and future</em>.  </p><p>[§90] An example of an aetiology that I have studied elsewhere in some detail is a complex of rituals and myths involving the god Apollo and the hero Pyrrhos at Delphi, where the overall ritual of slaughtering sheep and distributing in an orderly way their sacrificial meat inside the precinct of Apollo stands in sharp contrast with a myth, as reflected in Pindar’s <em>Nemean</em> 7 and <em>Paean</em> 6, about a disorderly distribution that resulted in the slaughtering of Pyrrhos himself when the hero arrived at Delphi to make sacrifice inside the precinct of the god (Nagy 2011a§§67–68, 70–72).</p><p>[§91] For another example of such an aetiology, I cite a story as retold by Herodotus (1.31.1–5) about a priestess of Hera and her two boys, named Kleobis and Biton. The mother and the two sons, all three of them, are involved as major characters in an aetiological myth about the ritual practice of the <em>hecatomb</em>, which was a sacrificial slaughtering of one hundred cattle in the precinct of the goddess Hera at the climax of the festival celebrated in her honor at Argos. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, see the comment on O.04.351–353. Also involved as major ‘characters’ in the story are two sacrificial oxen. The two boys, described as <em>āthlophoroi</em> ‘prize-winning athletes’, willingly took the place of the two sacrificial oxen, chosen to pull the wagon carrying the priestess across the plain of Argos—over a distance of 45 stadium-lengths—along a sacred way leading up to the precinct of Hera (1.31.2). The oxen had been late in arriving at the starting-point of the procession (again, 1.31.2), <em>and this lateness, in terms of the story, is the aetiological explanation for their replacement by the two athletes</em>. If these two oxen had not been late, they would have been slaughtered along with the other ninety-eight oxen that had been chosen for the mass sacrifice of one hundred cattle at the finishing-point of the procession, inside the precinct of Hera. At the feast that followed the sacrifice inside the precinct, the two boys died a mystical death after having pulled the wagon of the priestess from the starting-point all the way to this finishing-point of the procession (1.31.5). Thus, by way of this death that they shared with each other, the boys became sacrificial substitutes for the two premier victims of the animal sacrifice. (See Nagy 2015 ch. 4§142*1, with references to further commentary.) </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:4.343-4.344","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dominant vs. recessive versions of myths"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.200967","title":"Odyssey 4.351-4.362","body":"<p>Epitomized from Nagy 2015 §92:</p><p>Menelaos, narrating for Telemachus and the assembled company the tale of his own homecoming from Troy, explains why the gods had temporarily checked the winds that could bring him back home in the final phase of his sea voyage, O.04.351–362.

Hera had saved [<em>sōzein</em>] him. </p><p>O.4.512–513</p><p>Epitomized from Nagy 2015§§93–100:</p><p>[§93] By contrast with the temporary failure of Menelaos in his homecoming, as narrated by the hero himself at O.04.351–353, Agamemnon had already succeeded in sailing home, and Menelaos himself mentions this detail as he tells his own tale in <em>Odyssey</em> 4. In telling the tale, the explanation that Menelaos gives for his brother’s successful sea voyage is this: <em>because the goddess Hera had saved Agamemnon</em>. I note here the background: Proteus had told Menelaos about this salvation of Agamemnon from the sea, and that is how Menelaos knows about it. As he retells the tale to Telemachus, Menelaos is quoting here the words of Proteus about the success of Agamemnon at sea, to be contrasted with the temporary failure of Menelaos himself. </p><p>[§94] As we learn, then, from the words of Proteus in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, Agamemnon was in fact saved at sea, since his voyage by sea was successful. But then he was killed after he landed near home, ambushed by Aigisthos, and so the rest of his voyage, by land, became a failure O.04.514-537. After treacherously hosting him at a dinner, Aigisthos had slaughtered Agamemnon <em>as if that hero were some sacrificial ox that is being fed in a manger</em>, O.04.535. By contrast, the voyage of Menelaos by sea was ultimately successful, because he finally got around to making a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in Egypt, O.04.581–586. In making this sacrifice, Menelaos was following the instructions of Proteus, O.04.472–480, and, this way, he appeased the anger of the gods, O.04.583. Now Menelaos could at long last sail back to his homeland, safe and sound O.04.584–586. At I.05.714–717, Hera remarks to Athena that the two of them had promised to Menelaos a safe homecoming after the conquest of Troy.</p><p>[§95] We have seen, then, from the narrative of Menelaos in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, that Agamemnon was saved at sea by the goddess Hera, O.04.512–513. But why had Hera saved him? It was because, I argue, Agamemnon had at least tried to make a perfect sacrifice of one hundred cattle at Lesbos. By contrast, Menelaos had somehow failed to do his part in the corresponding sacrifice. In terms of my interpretation, based on the wording of Song 17 of Sappho, both Sons of Atreus had made an announcement-in-prayer about performing a sacrifice at Lesbos, but only Agamemnon succeeded in following through on that announcement.</p><p>[§96] I have already quoted the passage at O.04.252–254 where Menelaos says that the final phase of his sea voyage as he headed back home was held up by the gods precisely because he had not made a sacrifice of one hundred cattle. From the context, it is clear that this failure that made the gods so angry was a sin of omission, not commission. And his sin, I argue, was that<em> he somehow failed to perform a sacrifice of one hundred cattle at Lesbos</em>. But later on, when Menelaos does finally get around to performing a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in Egypt O.04.581–586, his performance is successful, and thus he finally appeases the anger of the gods, O.04.583. </p><p>[§97] The reader’s first impression may be that the sin of omission on the part of Menelaos, that is, his failure to perform a successful sacrifice of one hundred cattle, happens in Egypt: after all, the finding of a solution for the sin happens at this place—when Menelaos finally gets around to performing such a sacrifice. But such a first impression is wrong, I think, since Egypt was merely the last possible place as an occasion for such a sin of omission. There were many other places that Menelaos had visited before he ever reached Egypt, and Egypt had been for him merely the final stopover in the course of a most problematic overall sea voyage back home from Troy. Yes, the gods were in the process of punishing Menelaos <em>in</em> <em>Egypt</em> for his sin of omission when we see them interfering there with his sea voyage. And yes, the gods kept on interfering until Menelaos finally made the sacrifice, <em>in Egypt</em>, which was the place that turned out to be his point of departure in the very last phase of his sea voyage. But, as we will now see, the gods were already interfering with Menelaos in earlier phases of his sea voyage, and so the divine punishment for his sin of omission can be viewed as an ongoing series of misfortunes that kept on interfering with his travels after Troy. </p><p>[§98] The first such misfortune is already narrated by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, concerning the death, at Cape Sounion, of the hero Phrontis, who had been steering the ship of Menelaos, O.03.276–283. That death, caused by the god Apollo, O.03.279–280, holds back Menelaos from sailing ahead. Only after he conducts a proper funeral for his companion, O.03.284–285, does he recommence his sea voyage. Then, as Menelaos sails past the headlands of Maleiai, his ships are blown off course: some are swept away to Crete, where they run aground and are shattered, O.03.286–299, while five of them reach Egypt, O.03.299–300. (The details here are parallel to what is narrated in the epic Cycle: <em>Nostoi</em>, Proclus summary p. 108 lines 20–23 ed. Allen 1912). In sharp contrast, the hero Nestor has a safe and swift sea voyage back home to Pylos, O.03.182–183, having evidently rounded successfully the headlands of Maleiai (I follow here the analysis of Frame 2009:184n79). Meanwhile, once he reaches Egypt, Menelaos takes to plundering and looting there, and he amasses vast treasures, O.03.301, as ‘he was wandering around with his ships’, O.03.302 (ἠλᾶτο ξὺν νηυϲί). Later, in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, we learn from the narrative of Menelaos that his sea voyage had reached not only Egypt but also other exotic places, including Cyprus and Phoenicia, O.04.083, even Libya, O.04.085. After experiencing all these adventures, he was still just ‘wandering around’ in an aimless way, O.04.081 and O.04.083 (ἐπαληθείϲ), O.04.091 (ἠλώμην). As Menelaos himself remarks, he spent eight years just wandering around, O.04.082.</p><p>[§99] Already in the narrative of Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, the aimlessness of the sea voyage of Menelaos is anticipated: whereas Agamemnon got back home from Troy relatively soon, only to get killed by Aigisthos, Menelaos kept on wandering from one place to the next in his many sea voyages, and the word for his directionless maritime wanderings is <em>plazeto</em> ‘he was veering’, O.03.254 (πλάζετ’). Comparable, of course, are the even more extensive veerings of Odysseus in the overall Odyssey, as expressed by the same word <em>plazesthai</em> ‘veering’ already at the beginning of the epic: Odysseus is a hero ‘who veered [<em>plangthē</em>] in very many ways’, O.01.001–002 (ὃς μάλα πολλὰ | πλάγχθη). </p><p>[§100] So, where did all the veering begin for Menelaos? Where did his sea voyage start to go off course? According to one version of the myth about this hero’s travels by sea after Troy, as I will now argue, the veering can be traced all the way back to something that happened at Lesbos. I focus here on a detail we find in the tale told by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3. In that tale, <em>Menelaos was late in arriving at Lesbos</em>.

A comparable setting for immortalization is a place known as the <em>Makarōn nēsoi </em>‘Islands of the Blessed’ (as in Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 164–173). The name <em>Ēlusion</em> ‘Elysium’, as is evident from attestations outside of Homeric poetry, can refer to a mystical setting of immortalization as experienced by heroes worshipped in cult. From what evidence we have about hero cults, we can see that the rituals of worshipping heroes in cult places are ideologically synchronized with corresponding myths about the immortalization of these same heroes in paradise-like settings that are far removed from the everyday world. In fact, the forms <em>Ēlusion</em> &#x27;Elysium&#x27; and <em>Makarōn nēsoi</em> &#x27;Isles of the Blessed&#x27; are appropriate as names for actual cult sites. The proper noun <em>Ēlusion</em> coincides with the common noun <em>en-ēlúsion</em>, referring to a place made sacred by virtue of being struck by the thunderbolt (Pollux 9.41, etc.). The form <em>Ēlúsion</em> itself is glossed in the Alexandrian lexicographical tradition (Hesychius) as κεκεραυνωμένον χωρίον ἢ πεδίον ‘a place or field that has been struck by the thunderbolt&#x27;, with this added remark: καλεῖται δὲ καὶ ἐνηλύσια ‘and it is also called <em>enēlusia</em>’. As for <em>Makarōn nēsos</em> ‘Island of the Blessed’, there is a tradition that the name was actually applied to the old acropolis of Thebes, the Kadmeion; specifically, the name designated the sacred precinct where Semele, the mother of Dionysos, had been struck dead by the thunderbolt of Zeus (Parmenides via the Suda and via Photius, under <em>Makarōn nēsos</em>; Tzetzes on Lycophron 1194, 1204). We are immediately reminded of the poetic tradition that tells how Semele became immortalized as a direct result of dying from the thunderbolt of Zeus (see Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 2.25, in conjunction with Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 942). Inhabiting Elysium is the hero Rhadamanthys, O.04.564, who is described in this context as <em>xanthos</em> ‘with golden hair’.

When she asks her rhetorical question of whether the suitors listened to their parents tell of Odysseus, Penelope maintains, like Mentor, that it is ignorance or forgetfulness of Odysseus’ kindness as a ruler that explains the suitors’ arrogance. <em>ἀκούετε</em> (O.4.688), “you (pl.) hear,” here corresponds to a function of <em>mimnēskomai</em>, ‘remember’, when the latter denotes the performance of <em>klea andrōn</em>, epic songs about the glory of men: as <em>mimnēskomai</em> marks the activity of the bard, <em>akouō</em>, ‘hear’, is what the audience would do. The applicability of this constellation of concepts to the present passage is supported by Penelope’s insistence that Odysseus’ actions in the past were not only praiseworthy, but in fact also the subject of discourse – we can picture the suitors’ parents performing <em>klea andrōn</em>, specifically the <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus.</p><p>She also echoes Mentor, as well as Telemakhos, when she spells out that the suitors’ behavior is no fitting return for Odysseus’ treatment of his fellow men, and that the appropriate kind of reciprocation is manifestly not to be had (O.4.693-695). Where she differs from Mentor and Telemakhos, however, is in articulating the idea of reciprocity by using the term <em>kharis</em>, which here could be translated as ‘gratitude’, though its range of meanings is wider. In her speech, then, a connection is drawn between memory and reciprocity, specifically reciprocity denoted by <em>kharis </em>(see O.22.318-319 and my note there on the conventionality of the idea that good deeds deserve good <em>kharis </em>in return, and when that does not happen, the social system is being perverted).</p><p>Looking at how Telemakhos’, Mentor’s, and Penelope’s speeches converge on a topic but use different vocabulary to articulate what is involved makes apparent the connections between these key terms. We perceive the parallelism of <em>mēnis</em> and memory and their association with reciprocity in Telemakhos’ and Mentor’s speeches on the one hand, and the connection between memory and reciprocity denoted by <em>kharis </em>in particular in Penelope’s on the other. In addition, just as we can see that memory and <em>mēnis</em> are closely linked to <em>themis</em>, proper conduct, and upholding the cosmos (e.g. in Telemakhos’ speech in O.2), so the social role of <em>kharis</em>, especially as a force for or indication of proper social order (as in Penelope’s speech here), fits well in this network of concepts. Indeed, since the reciprocation of <em>kharites</em> (plural of <em>kharis</em>) is intended to establish a stable relationship with benefits to both parties, it appears to create an effect similar to that of the fear of <em>mēnis</em> or the positive guidance of memory. Just as <em>mēnis</em> and memory work to maintain the existing world order, so relationships of <em>kharis</em> are a further manifestation of the stability of the cosmos (see further O.24.281-286 and my note there on the connections between <em>kharis</em> and <em>themis</em>). Furthermore, a relationship of <em>kharis</em> involves memory (cp. e.g. dedications such as CEG 332 calling themselves <em>mnāma</em>), which can, in part, explain its similarity – or its kinship – to the purposes of <em>mēnis</em> and memory. The ideal of a remembering relationship of <em>kharis</em> as a manifestation of good behavior, however, is the opposite of what Penelope is talking about: in the scenario she describes, there is no <em>kharis</em>, no good conduct, and no memory of Odysseus. Compare Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 182-194 on the disruption of social order, proper reciprocal relationships and lack of <em>kharis</em>.</p><p>See further:</p><p>CEG = Hansen, P.
