Conversely, an evil turn should likewise be reciprocated by an evil turn, another aspect of reciprocity that Telemakhos’ words make clear, and which their chiastic arrangement further underscores (δυσμενέων κάκ’ ἔρεξεν … κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες ‘[if Odysseus,] bearing ill-will, did evil deeds … you are doing evil deeds, bearing ill-will,’ <em>Od</em>. 2.72-73). The Ithacans’ not stopping the suitors would in Telemakhos’ words be explicable as a return for an earlier bad turn by Odysseus, but if that is not the case, they deserve as punishment the <em>mēnis</em> of gods (<em>Od</em>. 2.66-67).</p><p>As for what <em>mēnis</em> is, let us take a step back and look at some elements in Telemakhos’s speech: he describes the wrongs of the suitors (<em>Od</em>. 2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – <em>mēnis </em>of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (<em>Od</em>. 2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (<em>Od</em>. 2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, <em>mēnis</em> is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of <em>mēnis</em> and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order. (Compare the speech of Mentor at <em>Od</em>. 2.229-241, in my note on which I discuss <em>mēnis</em> and memory, which works towards the same end as <em>mēnis</em> but in a symmetrically opposite manner, and the ethical function of the two further. With regard to reciprocity, Mentor, in contrast to what Telemakhos says here, is clear on the point that there has been no earlier bad turn by Odysseus that would justify the current outrage in Ithaca, and so, the people deserve a punishment as a reciprocation for their actions).</p><p>To return to reciprocity: just as <em>mēnis</em> has a moral dimension and a function in upholding the proper social and cosmic order, so, too, is reciprocity involved in morality. Reciprocal exchange is a total social phenomenon in the Maussian sense of the term, such that reciprocal exchange is also an articulation of the social order, of the cosmic hierarchy, and an instance of the working of <em>themis</em> (the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior) – it is worth noting here that Telemakhos appeals to Themis in his speech (<em>Od</em>. 2.68). <em>mēnis</em> in fact protects the rules of exchange and the hierarchy of proper cosmic order, and reciprocity and <em>mēnis</em> are thus interconnected. Telemakhos’ speech neatly illustrates this web of interconnected concepts, and his argument relies on understanding their role within the Homeric society.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Mauss, Marcel. 1990. <em>The Gift: The form and reason for exchange in archaic societies</em>.

Conversely, the speech also indicates that such forgetful subjects deserve harsh rulers (O.2.230-234): memory is the principle that maintains good social interactions and proper social order, and its absence brings about the opposite. Mentor’s name, ‘he who reminds,’ ‘he who stirs up’, is not inappropriate to the context, either.</p><p>Comparing Mentor’s speech with that of Telemakhos earlier in the assembly (O.2.45-69; some of what I discuss here is also included in my comment on O.2.63-79), we see further dimensions of memory as the principle that maintains proper social order. Telemakhos in his speech describes the wrongs of the suitors (O.2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – in his speech, it is <em>mēnis </em>of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (O.2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (O.2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, <em>mēnis</em> is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of <em>mēnis</em> and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order.</p><p>Likewise, then, we find all three elements of Telemakhos’ speech in that of Mentor’s, albeit with slight changes: the wrongs of the suitors are there (O.2.235-238) and the blame is extended to their solidarity group, the Ithacans (O.2.239-241, also O.2.233-234). Where there is a notable difference, however, is in the principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs: while in Telemakhos’ speech it is <em>mēnis</em>, in Mentor’s it is memory (O.2.233). However, Mentor makes clear that what is being perverted is the sovereign order, that of Odysseus’ position as the king over the Ithacans (O.2.230-234): this complements the role of <em>mēnis</em> in maintaining cosmic order, including the hierarchies of the sovereign order between and among gods and men. To underscore the parallelism of their speeches, at this very point Mentor’s words even echo those of Telemakhos’ (cp. πατὴρ δ’ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν ‘and how kind a father he was’, Telemakhos at O.2.47 and Mentor at O.2.234). Memory thus appears as the flipside of <em>mēnis</em>: just as the latter’s function is maintaining the cosmic order as a sanction, a punishment for transgressing the rules, memory is the principle that promotes behavior that agrees with cosmic order.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

The formula shows interesting patterns of restriction in both poems. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, it is always used with a female subject (Athena [2.382, 2.393, 4.795, 5.382, 6.112, 18.187, 23.242, 23.344], Helen [4.219], Nausikaa [6.251], or Penelope [16.409]). In the <em>Iliad</em>, it is used exclusively of Achilles (23.140, 23.193). See <em>Iliad</em> 23.140 for discussion of the two Iliadic instances; here I concentrate on the formula’s occurrences in the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>\r\n<p>From a narratological point of view, the expression has an important function: as noted by de Jong 2001:66, it “highlights a new, often sudden or unexpected turn in the story,” in this case “the—abrupt—change of scene from Telemachus to Athena.” In other words, the formula marks the development of the plot in a new direction that is not a mere continuation of what has preceded. (<em>Odyssey</em><em> </em>23.242 is a significant exception.) Furthermore, it links this new development with the intervention of some specific agent, who is thus momentarily represented as controlling the plot. De Jong 2001:66 notes that the frequency with which the expression is used of Athena corresponds to the goddess’s “role of ‘director’ of the story of the <em>Odyssey</em>.” Occurrences of the formula with Helen, Nausikaa, and Penelope as subjects extend this plot-making power to other prominent women. In this way, a convenient narrative device serves also to underscore one of the poem’s major thematic concerns, namely, the way in which the story of Odysseus’ homecoming—the plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>—depends upon the favorable disposition of certain women, above all Penelope. The poem has numerous ways of signaling that its plot hinges on female agents (see <em>Odyssey </em>11.226, <em>Odyssey </em>11.436-39). This should not, however, be interpreted as a subversive gesture: as stressed by Murnaghan 2005, Athena as “source and sponsor” of the <em>Odyssey</em>’s plot works to uphold the authority of the patriarchal <em>oikos</em>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n<p>de Jong, Irene J.
