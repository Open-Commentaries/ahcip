On\n    this Helen, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, sat down, and with eyes askance\n    began to upbraid her husband. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"428\" unit=\"line\"/>\"So you are come from the fight,\" said she;\n    \"would that you had fallen rather by the hand of that brave man who was my\n    husband. You used to brag that you were a better man with might [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>] of hands and spear than Menelaos. Go, then, and\n    challenge him again - but I would advise you not to do so, for if you are\n    foolish enough to meet him in single combat, you will soon fall by his spear.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"436\" unit=\"line\"/>And <placeName key=\"tgn,7008038\">Paris</placeName> answered, \"Woman, do not vex me with your reproaches.\n    This time, with the help of Athena, Menelaos has vanquished me; another time I\n    may myself be victor, for I too have gods that will stand by me. Come, let us\n    lie down together and make friends. Never yet was I so passionately enamored of\n    you as at this moment - not even when I first carried you off from <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName> and sailed away with you - not even\n    when I had converse with you upon the couch of love in the island of Cranae was\n    I so enthralled by desire of you as now.\" On this he led her towards the bed,\n    and his wife went with him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"447\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus they laid themselves on the bed together;\n    but the son of Atreus strode among the throng, looking everywhere for\n    Alexander, and no man, neither of the Trojans nor of the allies, could find\n    him. If they had seen him they were in no mind to hide him, for they all of\n    them hated him as they did death itself. Then Agamemnon, king of men, </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"456\" unit=\"line\"/>spoke, saying, \"Hear me, Trojans, Dardanians,\n    and allies. The victory has been with Menelaos; therefore give back Helen with\n    all her wealth, and pay such fine [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">timê</term>] as shall\n    be agreed upon, in testimony among them that shall be born hereafter.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"461\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus spoke the son of Atreus, and the Achaeans\n    shouted in approval.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
