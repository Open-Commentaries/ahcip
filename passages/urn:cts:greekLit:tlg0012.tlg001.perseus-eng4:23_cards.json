But Achilles\n    would not let the Myrmidons go, and spoke to his brave comrades saying,\n    \"Myrmidons, famed horsemen and my own trusted friends, not yet, I say, let us\n    unyoke, but with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn Patroklos,\n    in due honor to the dead. When we have had full comfort of lamentation we will\n    unyoke our horses and take supper all of us here.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"12\" unit=\"line\"/>On this they all joined in a cry of wailing and\n    Achilles led them in their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all\n    sorrowing round the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper\n    yearning. The sands of the seashore and the men's armor were wet with their\n    weeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief in all\n    their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained hand on the\n    breast of his friend. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroklos, even in the house of\n    Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile promised you; I will drag Hektor\n    hither and let dogs devour him raw; twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also\n    slay before your pyre to avenge you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"24\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hektor\n    with contumely, laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of\n    Patroklos. The others then put off every man his armor, took the horses from\n    their chariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the ship of the\n    fleet descendant of Aiakos,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"29\" unit=\"line\"/>who thereon feasted them with an abundant\n    funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep and bleating goat did they\n    butcher and cut up; many a tusked boar moreover, fat and well-fed, did they\n    singe and set to roast in the flames of Hephaistos; and rivulets of blood\n    flowed all round the place where the body was lying. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"35\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the princes of the Achaeans took the son of\n    Peleus to Agamemnon, but hardly could they persuade him to come with them, so\n    wroth was he for the death of his comrade. As soon as they reached Agamemnon's\n    tent they told the serving-men to set a large tripod over the fire in case they\n    might persuade the son of Peleus ‘to wash the clotted gore from this body, but\n    he denied them sternly, and swore it with a solemn oath, saying, \"Nay, by King\n    Zeus, first and mightiest of all gods, it is not right [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">themis</term>] that water should touch my body, till I have laid Patroklos\n    on the flames, have built him a tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>], and\n    shaved my head - for so long as I live no such second sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] shall ever draw nigh me. Now, therefore, let us\n    do all that this sad festival demands, but at break of day, King Agamemnon, bid\n    your men bring wood, and provide all else that the dead may duly take into the\n    realm of darkness; the fire shall thus burn him out of our sight the sooner,\n    and the people shall turn again to their own labors.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"54\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had\n    said. They made haste to prepare the meal, they ate, and every man had his full\n    share so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\n    drink, the others went to their rest each in his own tent, but the son of\n    Peleus lay grieving among his Myrmidons by the shore of the sounding sea, in an\n    open place where the waves came surging in one after another. Here a very deep\n    slumber took hold upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows, for his limbs\n    were weary with chasing Hektor round windy <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>. Presently the sad spirit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of Patroklos drew near him, like what he had been in\n    stature, voice, and the light of his beaming eyes, clad, too, as he had been\n    clad in life. The spirit hovered over his head and said- </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"69\" unit=\"line\"/>\"You sleep, Achilles, and have forgotten me; you\n    loved me living, but now that I am dead you think for me no further.

Give me now your hand I pray you, for when you have once given me my\n    dues of fire, never shall I again come forth out of the house of Hades.\n    Nevermore shall we sit apart and take sweet counsel among the living; the cruel\n    fate which was my birth-right has yawned its wide jaws around me - nay, you too\n    Achilles, peer of gods, are doomed to die beneath the wall of the noble\n    Trojans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"82\" unit=\"line\"/>\"One prayer more will I make you, if you will\n    grant it; let not my bones be laid apart from yours, Achilles, but with them;\n    even as we were brought up together in your own home, what time Menoitios\n    brought me to you as a child from Opoeis because by a sad spite I had killed\n    the son of Amphidamas - not of set purpose, but in childish quarrel over the\n    dice. The horseman Peleus took me into his house, entreated me kindly, and\n    named me to be your squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>]; therefore\n    let our bones lie in but a single urn, the two-handled golden vase given to you\n    by your mother.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"93"},{"n":"93","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"93\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"93\" unit=\"line\"/>And Achilles answered, \"Why, true heart, are you\n    come hither to lay these charges upon me? will of my own self do all as you\n    have bidden me.

Achilles sprang to his feet, smote his two hands, and made\n    lamentation saying, \"Of a truth even in the house of Hades there are ghosts\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhai</term>] and phantoms that have no life in\n    them;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>all night long the sad spirit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of Patroklos has hovered over head making\n    piteous moan, telling me what I am to do for him, and looking wondrously like\n    himself.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"108\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak and his words set them all\n    weeping and mourning about the poor dumb dead, till rosy-fingered morn\n    appeared. Then King Agamemnon sent men and mules from all parts of the camp, to\n    bring wood, and Meriones, squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] to\n    Idomeneus, was in charge over them. They went out with woodmen's axes and\n    strong ropes in their hands, and before them went the mules. Up hill and down\n    dale did they go, by straight ways and crooked, and when they reached the\n    heights of many-fountained Ida, they laid their axes to the roots of many a\n    tall branching oak that came thundering down as they felled it. They split the\n    trees and bound them behind the mules, which then wended their way as they best\n    could through the thick brushwood on to the plain. All who had been cutting\n    wood bore logs, for so Meriones squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>]\n    to Idomeneus had bidden them, and they threw them down in a line upon the\n    seashore at the place where Achilles would make a mighty monument for Patroklos\n    and for himself. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"127\" unit=\"line\"/>When they had thrown down their great logs of\n    wood over the whole ground, they stayed all of them where they were, but\n    Achilles ordered his brave Myrmidons to gird on their armor, and to yoke each\n    man his horses; they therefore rose, girded on their armor and mounted each his\n    chariot - they and their charioteers with them. The chariots went before, and\n    they that were on foot followed as a cloud in their tens of thousands after. In\n    the midst of them his comrades bore Patroklos and covered him with the locks of\n    their hair which they cut off and threw upon his body. Last came Achilles with\n    his head bowed for sorrow, so noble a comrade was he taking to the house of\n    Hades. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"138\" unit=\"line\"/>When they came to the place of which Achilles\n    had told them they laid the body down and built up the wood. Achilles then\n    bethought him of another matter. He went a space away from the pyre, and cut\n    off the yellow lock which he had let grow for the river Spercheios. He looked\n    all sorrowfully out upon the dark sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], and\n    said, \"Spercheios, in vain did my father Peleus vow to you that when I returned\n    home to my loved native land I should cut off this lock and offer you a holy\n    hecatomb; fifty she-goats was I to sacrifice to you there at your springs,\n    where is your grove and your altar fragrant with burnt-offerings. Thus did my\n    father vow, but you have not fulfilled the thinking [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] of his prayer; now, therefore, that I shall see my home no\n    more, I give this lock as a keepsake to the hero Patroklos.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"152\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he placed the lock in the hands of\n    his dear comrade, and all who stood by were filled with yearning and\n    lamentation. The sun would have gone down upon their mourning had not Achilles\n    presently said to Agamemnon, \"Son of Atreus, for it is to you that the people\n    will give ear, there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning; bid\n    the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners: we, to whom\n    the dead is dearest, will see to what is wanted here, and let the other princes\n    also stay by me.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"161\" unit=\"line\"/>When King Agamemnon heard this he dismissed the\n    people to their ships, but those who were about the dead heaped up wood and\n    built a pyre a hundred feet this way and that; then they laid the dead all\n    sorrowfully upon the top of it. They flayed and dressed many fat sheep and oxen\n    before the pyre, and Achilles took fat from all of them and wrapped the body\n    therein from head to foot, heaping the flayed carcasses all round it. Against\n    the bier he leaned two-handled jars of honey and unguents; four proud horses\n    did he then cast upon the pyre, groaning the while he did so. The dead hero had\n    had house-dogs; two of them did Achilles slay and threw upon the pyre; he also\n    put twelve brave sons of noble Trojans to the sword and laid them with the\n    rest, for he was full of bitterness and fury.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"177"},{"n":"177","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"177\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"177\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he committed all to the resistless and\n    devouring might of the fire; he groaned aloud and called on his dead comrade by\n    name. \"Fare well,\" he cried, \"Patroklos, even in the house of Hades; I am now\n    doing all that I have promised you. Twelve brave sons of noble Trojans shall\n    the flames consume along with yourself, but dogs, not fire, shall devour the\n    flesh of Hektor son of Priam.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"184\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he vaunt, but the dogs came not about\n    the body of Hektor, for Zeus' daughter Aphrodite kept them off him night and\n    day, and anointed him with ambrosial oil of roses that his flesh might not be\n    torn when Achilles was dragging him about. Phoebus Apollo moreover sent a dark\n    cloud from heaven to earth, which gave shade to the whole place where Hektor\n    lay, that the heat of the sun might not parch his body. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"193\" unit=\"line\"/>Now the pyre about dead Patroklos would not\n    kindle. Achilles therefore bethought him of another matter; he went apart and\n    prayed to the two winds Boreas and Zephyros vowing them goodly offerings. He\n    made them many drink-offerings from the golden cup and besought them to come\n    and help him that the wood might make haste to kindle and the dead bodies be\n    consumed. Fleet Iris heard him praying and started off to fetch the winds. They\n    were holding high feast in the house of boisterous Zephyros when Iris came\n    running up to the stone threshold of the house and stood there, but as soon as\n    they set eyes on her they all came towards her and each of them called her to\n    him, but Iris would not sit down. \"I cannot stay,\" she said, \"I must go back to\n    the streams of Okeanos and the land of the Ethiopians who are offering\n    hecatombs to the immortals, and I would have my share; but Achilles prays that\n    Boreas and shrill Zephyros will come to him, and he vows them goodly offerings;\n    he would have you blow upon the pyre of Patroklos for whom all the Achaeans are\n    lamenting.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"212\" unit=\"line\"/>With this she left them, and the two winds rose\n    with a cry that rent the air and swept the clouds before them. They blew on and\n    on until they came to the sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], and the\n    waves rose high beneath them, but when they reached <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> they fell upon the pyre till the mighty\n    flames roared under the blast that they blew. All night long did they blow hard\n    and beat upon the fire, and all night long did Achilles grasp his double cup,\n    drawing wine from a mixing-bowl of gold, and calling upon the spirit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of dead Patroklos as he poured it upon the\n    ground until the earth was drenched. As a father mourns when he is burning the\n    bones of his bridegroom son whose death has wrung the hearts of his parents,\n    even so did Achilles mourn while burning the body of his comrade, pacing round\n    the bier with piteous groaning and lamentation. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"226\" unit=\"line\"/>At length as the Morning Star was beginning to\n    herald the light which saffron-mantled Dawn was soon to suffuse over the sea,\n    the flames fell and the fire began to die. The winds then went home beyond the\n    Thracian sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], which roared and boiled as\n    they swept over it. The son of Peleus now turned away from the pyre and lay\n    down, overcome with toil, till he fell into a sweet slumber. Presently they who\n    were about the son of Atreus drew near in a body, and roused him with the noise\n    and tramp of their coming. He sat upright and said, \"Son of Atreus, and all\n    other princes of the Achaeans, first pour red wine everywhere upon the fire and\n    quench it; let us then gather the bones of Patroklos son of Menoitios, singling\n    them out with care; they are easily found, for they lie in the middle of the\n    pyre, while all else, both men and horses, has been thrown in a heap and burned\n    at the outer edge. We will lay the bones in a golden urn, in two layers of fat,\n    against the time when I shall myself go down into the house of Hades. As for\n    the barrow, labor not to raise a great one now, but such as is reasonable.\n    Afterwards, let those Achaeans who may be left at the ships when I am gone,\n    build it both broad and high.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"249\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus he spoke and they obeyed the word of the\n    son of Peleus. First they poured red wine upon the thick layer of ashes and\n    quenched the fire. With many tears they singled out the whitened bones of their\n    loved comrade and laid them within a golden urn in two layers of fat: they then\n    covered the urn with a linen cloth and took it inside the tent. They marked off\n    the circle where the tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] should be, made a\n    foundation for it about the pyre, and forthwith heaped up the earth. When they\n    had thus raised a mound [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] they were going\n    away, but Achilles stayed the people and made them sit in assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>]. He brought prizes from the ships - cauldrons,\n    tripods, horses and mules, noble oxen, women with fair girdles, and swart iron. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"262\" unit=\"line\"/>The first prize he offered was for the chariot\n    races - a woman skilled in all useful arts, and a three-legged cauldron that\n    had ears for handles, and would hold twenty-two measures. This was for the man\n    who came in first. For the second there was a six-year old mare, unbroken, and\n    in foal to a he-ass; the third was to have a goodly cauldron that had never yet\n    been on the fire; it was still bright as when it left the maker, and would hold\n    four measures. The fourth prize was two talents of gold, and the fifth a\n    two-handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke. Then he stood up and spoke among the\n    Argives saying- </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"272\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, these\n    are the prizes that lie waiting the winners in the contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] of the chariot races.

Next to him rose mighty\n    Diomedes son of Tydeus; he yoked the Trojan horses which he had taken from\n    Aeneas, when Apollo bore him out of the fight. Next to him, yellow-haired\n    Menelaos son of Atreus rose and yoked his fleet horses, Agamemnon's mare Aithe,\n    and his own horse Podagros. The mare had been given to Agamemnon by Echepolos\n    son of Anchises, that he might not have to follow him to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, but might stay at home and take his\n    ease; for Zeus had endowed him with great wealth and he lived in spacious\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011104\">Sicyon</placeName>.

I need not therefore say much by way of\n    instruction. You are skillful at wheeling your horses round the post, but the\n    horses themselves are very slow, and it is this that will, I fear, mar your\n    chances. The other drivers know less than you do, but their horses are fleeter;\n    therefore, my dear son, see if you cannot hit upon some artifice [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mêtis</term>] whereby you may insure that the prize shall not\n    slip through your fingers. The woodsman does more by skill [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mêtis</term>] than by brute force [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>]; by skill [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mêtis</term>] the pilot guides\n    his storm-tossed ship over the sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], and so\n    by skill [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mêtis</term>] one driver can beat another. If a\n    man go wide in rounding this way and that, whereas a man of craft [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>] may have worse horses, but he will keep them\n    well in hand when he sees the turning-post [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">terma</term>];</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"324\" unit=\"line\"/>he knows the precise moment at which to pull\n    the rein, and keeps his eye well on the man in front of him. I will give you\n    this certain sign [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] which cannot escape your\n    notice. There is a stump of a dead tree-oak or pine as it may be - some six\n    feet above the ground, and not yet rotted away by rain; it stands at the fork\n    of the road; it has two white stones set one on each side, and there is a clear\n    course all round it. It may have been a tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>]\n    of someone who died long ago, or it may have been used as a turning-post in\n    days gone by; now, however, it has been fixed on by Achilles as the mark [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">terma</term>] round which the chariots shall turn; hug it as\n    close as you can, but as you stand in your chariot lean over a little to the\n    left; urge on your right-hand horse with voice and lash, and give him a loose\n    rein, but let the left-hand horse keep so close in, that the nave of your wheel\n    shall almost graze the post; but mind the stone, or you will wound your horses\n    and break your chariot in pieces, which would be sport for others but confusion\n    for yourself. Therefore, my dear son, mind well what you are about, for if you\n    can be first to round the post there is no chance of any one giving you the\n    go-by later, not even though you had Adrastos' horse Arion behind you horse\n    which is of divine race - or those of Laomedon, which are the noblest in this\n    country.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"349\" unit=\"line\"/>When Nestor had made an end of counseling his\n    son he sat down in his place, and fifth in order Meriones got ready his horses.\n    They then all mounted their chariots and cast lots. - Achilles shook the\n    helmet, and the lot of Antilokhos son of Nestor fell out first; next came that\n    of King Eumelos, and after his, those of Menelaos son of Atreus and of\n    Meriones. The last place fell to the lot of Diomedes son of Tydeus, who was the\n    best man of them all. They took their places in line; Achilles showed them the\n    turning-post round which they were to turn, some way off upon the plain; here\n    he stationed his father's follower Phoenix as umpire, to note the running, and\n    report truly. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"361\" unit=\"line\"/>At the same instant they all of them lashed\n    their horses, struck them with the reins, and shouted at them with all their\n    might.

At one moment the chariots seemed to touch the ground, and\n    then again they bounded into the air; the drivers stood erect, and their hearts\n    beat fast and furious in their lust of victory.

The horses of the descendant of Pheres now\n    took the lead, and close behind them came the Trojan stallions of Diomedes.\n    They seemed as if about to mount Eumelos' chariot, and he could feel their warm\n    breath on his back and on his broad shoulders, for their heads were close to\n    him as they flew over the course. Diomedes would have now passed him, or there\n    would have been a dead heat, but Phoebus Apollo to spite him made him drop his\n    whip. Tears of anger fell from his eyes as he saw the mares going on faster\n    than ever, while his own horses lost ground through his having no whip. Athena\n    saw the trick which Apollo had played the son of Tydeus, so she brought him his\n    whip and put spirit into his horses; moreover she went after the son of Admetos\n    in a rage and broke his yoke for him; the mares went one to one side the\n    course, and the other to the other, and the pole was broken against the ground.\n    Eumelos was thrown from his chariot close to the wheel; his elbows, mouth, and\n    nostrils were all torn, and his forehead was bruised above his eyebrows; his\n    eyes filled with tears and he could find no utterance. But the son of Tydeus\n    turned his horses aside and shot far ahead, for Athena put fresh strength into\n    them and covered Diomedes himself with glory. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"401\" unit=\"line\"/>Menelaos son of Atreus came next behind him,\n    but Antilokhos called to his father's horses. \"On with you both,\" he cried,\n    \"and do your very utmost. I do not bid you try to beat the steeds of the son of\n    Tydeus, for Athena has put running into them, and has covered Diomedes with\n    glory; but you must overtake the horses of the son of Atreus and not be left\n    behind, or Aethe who is so fleet will taunt you. Why, my good men, are you\n    lagging? I tell you, and it shall surely be - Nestor will keep neither of you,\n    but will put both of you to the sword, if we win any the worse a prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] through your carelessness, fly after them at\n    your utmost speed; I will hit on a plan for passing them in a narrow part of\n    the way, and it shall not fail me.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"417\" unit=\"line\"/>They feared the rebuke of their master, and for\n    a short space went quicker. Presently Antilokhos saw a narrow place where the\n    road had sunk. The ground was broken, for the winter's rain had gathered and\n    had worn the road so that the whole place was deepened. Menelaos was making\n    towards it so as to get there first, for fear of a foul, but Antilokhos turned\n    his horses out of the way, and followed him a little on one side. The son of\n    Atreus was afraid and shouted out, \"Antilokhos, you are driving recklessly;\n    rein in your horses; the road is too narrow here, it will be wider soon, and\n    you can pass me then; if you foul my chariot you may bring both of us to a\n    mischief.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"429"},{"n":"429","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"429\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"429\" unit=\"line\"/>But Antilokhos plied his whip, and drove\n    faster, as though he had not heard him. They went side by side for about as far\n    as a young man can hurl a disc from his shoulder when he is trying his\n    strength, and then Menelaos' mares drew behind, for he left off driving for\n    fear the horses should foul one another and upset the chariots; thus, while\n    pressing on in quest of victory, they might both come headlong to the ground.\n    Menelaos then upbraided Antilokhos and said, \"There is no greater trickster\n    living than you are; go, and bad luck go with you; the Achaeans say not well\n    that you have understanding, and come what may you shall not bear away the\n    prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] without sworn protest on my part.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"442\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he called on his horses and said to them,\n    \"Keep your pace, and slacken not; the limbs of the other horses will weary\n    sooner than yours, for they are neither of them young.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>The horses feared the rebuke of their master,\n    and went faster, so that they were soon nearly up with the others. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"448\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile the Achaeans from their seats were\n    watching how the horses went, as they scoured the plain amid clouds of their\n    own dust. Idomeneus leader of the Cretans was first to make out the running,\n    for he was not in the thick of the crowd, but stood on the most commanding part\n    of the ground. The driver was a long way off from the assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>], but Idomeneus could hear him shouting, and\n    could see the foremost horse quite plainly - a chestnut with a round white mark\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>], like the moon, on its forehead. He stood\n    up and said among the Argives, \"My friends, princes and counselors of the\n    Argives, can you see the running as well as I can? There seems to be another\n    pair in front now, and another driver; those that led off at the start must\n    have been disabled out on the plain. I saw them at first making their way round\n    the turning-post, but now, though I search the plain of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, I cannot find them. Perhaps the reins\n    fell from the driver's hand so that he lost command of his horses at the\n    turning-post, and could not turn it. I suppose he must have been thrown out\n    there, and broken his chariot, while his mares have left the course and gone\n    off wildly in a panic. Come up and see for yourselves, I cannot make out for\n    certain, but the driver seems an Aetolian by descent, ruler over the Argives,\n    brave Diomedes the son of Tydeus.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"473\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax the son of Oileus took him up rudely and\n    said, \"Idomeneus, why should you be in such a hurry to tell us all about it,\n    when the mares are still so far out upon the plain? You are none of the\n    youngest, nor your eyes none of the sharpest, but you are always laying down\n    the law. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"478\" unit=\"line\"/>You have no right to do so, for there are\n    better men here than you are.

The sand and grit rained thick on the\n    driver, and the chariot inlaid with gold and tin ran close behind his fleet\n    horses. There was little trace of wheel-marks in the fine dust, and the horses\n    came flying in at their utmost speed. Diomedes stayed them in the middle of the\n    assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>], and the sweat from their manes and\n    chests fell in streams on to the ground. Forthwith he sprang from his goodly\n    chariot, and leaned his whip against his horses' yoke; brave Sthenelos now lost\n    no time, but at once brought on the prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>],\n    and gave the woman and the ear-handled cauldron to his comrades to take away.\n    Then he unyoked the horses. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"514\" unit=\"line\"/>Next after him came in Antilokhos of the race\n    of Neleus, who had passed Menelaos by craft [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>] and not by the fleetness of his horses; but even so Menelaos\n    came in as close behind him as the wheel is to the horse that draws both the\n    chariot and its master. The end hairs of a horse's tail touch the tire of the\n    wheel, and there is never much space between wheel and horse when the chariot\n    is going; Menelaos was no further than this behind Antilokhos, though at first\n    he had been a full disc's throw behind him. He had soon caught him up again,\n    for Agamemnon's mare Aethe kept pulling stronger and stronger, so that if the\n    course had been longer he would have passed him, and there would not even have\n    been a dead heat. Idomeneus' brave squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] Meriones was about a spear's cast behind Menelaos. His horses\n    were slowest of all in the contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>], and he\n    was the worst driver. Last of them all came the son of Admetos, dragging his\n    chariot and driving his horses on in front. When Achilles saw him he was sorry,\n    and stood up among the Argives saying, \"The best man is coming in last. Let us\n    give him a prize for it is reasonable. He shall have the second, but the first\n    must go to the son of Tydeus.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"539\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak and the others all of them\n    applauded his saying, and were for doing as he had said, but Nestor's son\n    Antilokhos stood up and claimed his rights from the son of Peleus. \"Achilles,\"\n    said he, \"I shall take it much amiss if you do this thing; you would rob me of\n    my prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>], because you think Eumelos'\n    chariot and horses were thrown out, and himself too, good man that he is. He\n    should have prayed duly to the immortals; he would not have come in fast if he\n    had done so. If you are sorry for him and so choose, you have much gold in your\n    tents, with bronze, sheep, cattle, and horses. Take something from this store\n    if you would have the Achaeans speak well of you, and give him a better prize\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] even than that which you have now\n    offered; but I will not give up the mare, and he that will fight me for her,\n    let him come on.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"555\" unit=\"line\"/>Achilles smiled as he heard this, and was\n    pleased with Antilokhos, who was one of his dearest comrades. So he said - </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"558\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Antilokhos, if you would have me find Eumelos\n    another prize, I will give him the bronze breastplate with a rim of tin running\n    all round it which I took from Asteropaios.

Achilles then gave it over to\n    Eumelos, who received it gladly. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"566\" unit=\"line\"/>But Menelaos got up in a rage, furiously angry\n    with Antilokhos. An attendant placed his staff in his hands and bade the\n    Argives keep silence: the hero then addressed them. \"Antilokhos,\" said he,\n    \"what is this from you who have been so far blameless? You have shamed my\n    excellence [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aretê</term>] and baulked my horses by\n    flinging your own in front of them, though yours are much worse than mine are;\n    therefore, O princes and counselors of the Argives, judge between us and show\n    no favor, lest one of the Achaeans say, ‘Menelaos has got the mare through\n    lying and corruption; his horses were far inferior to Antilokhos', but he is\n    superior in excellence [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aretê</term>] and force [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>].’ Nay, I will determine the matter myself, and no\n    man will blame me, for I shall do what is just.

He turned to Antilokhos\n    and said, \"Now, Antilokhos, angry though I have been, I can give way to you of\n    my own free will; you have never been headstrong nor ill-disposed hitherto, but\n    this time your youth has got the better of your judgment [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>]; be careful how you outwit your betters in future; no one else\n    could have brought me round so easily, but your good father, your brother, and\n    yourself have all of you had infinite trouble on my behalf; I therefore yield\n    to your entreaty, and will give up the mare to you, mine though it indeed be;\n    the people will thus see that I am neither harsh nor vindictive.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"612\" unit=\"line\"/>With this he gave the mare over to Antilokhos'\n    comrade Noemon, and then took the cauldron. Meriones, who had come in fourth,\n    carried off the two talents of gold, and the fifth prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>], the two-handled urn, being unawarded, Achilles gave it to\n    Nestor, going up to him in the assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] of\n    Argives and saying, \"Take this, my good old friend, as an heirloom and memorial\n    of the funeral of Patroklos - for you shall see him no more among the Argives.\n    I give you this prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] though you cannot\n    win one; you can now neither wrestle nor fight, and cannot enter for the\n    javelin-match nor foot-races, for the hand of age has been laid heavily upon\n    you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"624\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying he gave the urn over to Nestor, who\n    received it gladly and answered, \"My son, all that you have said is true; there\n    is no strength now in my legs and feet, nor can I hit out with my hands from\n    either shoulder. Would that I were still young and strong as when the Epeans\n    were burying King Amarynkeus in Bouprasion, and his sons offered prizes in his\n    honor. There was then none that could vie with me neither of the Epeans nor the\n    Pylians themselves nor the Aetolians. In boxing I overcame Klytomedes son of\n    Enops, and in wrestling, Ankaios of Pleuron who had come forward against me.\n    Iphiklos was a good runner, </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"636\" unit=\"line\"/>but I beat him, and threw farther with my spear\n    than either Phyleus or Polydoros. In chariot-racing alone did the two sons of\n    Aktor surpass me by crowding their horses in front of me, for they were angry\n    at the way victory had gone, and at the greater part of the prizes remaining in\n    the place in which they had been offered. They were twins, and the one kept on\n    holding the reins, and holding the reins, while the other plied the whip. Such\n    was I then, but now I must leave these matters to younger men; I must bow\n    before the weight of years, but in those days I was eminent among heroes. And\n    now, sir, go on with the funeral contests [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athloi</term>]\n    in honor of your comrade: gladly do I accept this urn, and my heart rejoices\n    that you do not forget me but are ever mindful of my goodwill towards you, and\n    of the respect [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">timê</term>] due to me from the Achaeans.\n    For all which may the grace [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharis</term>] of heaven be\n    granted you in great abundance.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"651\" unit=\"line\"/>Thereon the son of Peleus, when he had listened\n    to all the praise [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ainos</term>] of Nestor, went about\n    among the concourse of the Achaeans, and presently offered prizes for skill in\n    the painful art of boxing. He brought out a strong mule, and made it fast in\n    the middle of the crowd [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] - a she-mule never\n    yet broken, but six years old - when it is hardest of all to break them: this\n    was for the victor, and for the vanquished he offered a double cup. Then he\n    stood up and said among the Argives, \"Son of Atreus, and all other Achaeans, I\n    invite our two champion boxers to lay about them lustily and compete for these\n    prizes. He to whom Apollo grants the greater endurance, and whom the Achaeans\n    acknowledge as victor, shall take the mule back with him to his own tent, while\n    he that is vanquished shall have the double cup.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"664\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke there stood up a champion both\n    brave and great stature, a skillful boxer, Epeios, son of Panopeus.

I tell you plainly,\n    and it shall come true; if any man will box with me I will bruise his body and\n    break his bones; therefore let his friends stay here in a body and be at hand\n    to take him away when I have done with him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"676\" unit=\"line\"/>They all held their peace, and no man rose save\n    Euryalos son of Mekisteus, who was son of Talaos. Mekisteus went once to\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Thebes\">Thebes</placeName> after the fall of\n    Oedipus, to attend his funeral, and he beat all the people of Cadmus. The son\n    of Tydeus was Euryalos' second, cheering him on and hoping heartily that he\n    would win. First he put a waistband round him and then he gave him some\n    well-cut thongs of ox-hide; the two men being now girt went into the middle of\n    the ring [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>], and immediately fell to; heavily\n    indeed did they punish one another and lay about them with their brawny fists.\n    One could hear the horrid crashing of their jaws, and they sweated from every\n    pore of their skin. Presently Epeios came on and gave Euryalos a blow on the\n    jaw as he was looking round; Euryalos could not keep his legs; they gave way\n    under him in a moment and he sprang up with a bound, as a fish leaps into the\n    air near some shore that is all bestrewn with sea-wrack, when Boreas furs the\n    top of the waves, and then falls back into deep water. But noble Epeios caught\n    hold of him and raised him up; his comrades also came round him and led him\n    from the ring [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>], unsteady in his gait, his\n    head hanging on one side, and spitting great clots of gore. They set him down\n    in a swoon and then went to fetch the double cup. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"700\" unit=\"line\"/>The son of Peleus now brought out the prizes\n    for the third contest and showed them to the Argives.

For the loser he brought out a woman skilled in all manner of\n    arts, and they valued her at four oxen. He rose and said among the Argives,\n    \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"708\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon,\n    and crafty Odysseus, full of craft [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>] rose\n    also. The two girded themselves and went into the middle of the ring [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>]. They gripped each other in their strong hands\n    like the rafters which some master-builder frames for the roof of a high house\n    to keep the wind out. Their backbones cracked as they tugged at one another\n    with their mighty arms - and sweat rained from them in torrents. Many a bloody\n    weal sprang up on their sides and shoulders, but they kept on striving with\n    might and main for victory and to win the tripod. Odysseus could not throw\n    Ajax, nor Ajax him; Odysseus was too strong for him; but when the Achaeans\n    began to tire of watching them, Ajax said to Odysseus, \"Odysseus, noble son of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, you shall either lift\n    me, or I you, and let Zeus settle it between us.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"725\" unit=\"line\"/>He lifted him from the ground as he spoke, but\n    Odysseus did not forget his cunning. He hit Ajax in the hollow at back of his\n    knee, so that he could not keep his feet, but fell on his back with Odysseus\n    lying upon his chest, and all who saw it marveled. Then Odysseus in turn lifted\n    Ajax and stirred him a little from the ground but could not lift him right off\n    it, his knee sank under him, and the two fell side by side on the ground and\n    were all begrimed with dust. They now sprang towards one another and were for\n    wrestling yet a third time, but Achilles rose and stayed them. \"Put not each\n    other further,\" said he, \"to such cruel suffering; the victory is with both\n    alike, take each of you an equal prize, and let the other Achaeans now\n    compete.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"738\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak and they did even as he had\n    said, and put on their shirts again after wiping the dust from off their\n    bodies. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"739\" unit=\"line\"/>The son of Peleus then offered prizes for speed\n    in running - a mixing-bowl beautifully wrought, of pure silver. It would hold\n    six measures, and far exceeded all others in the whole world for beauty; it was\n    the work of cunning artificers in <placeName key=\"tgn,7002861\">Sidon</placeName>, and had been brought into port by Phoenicians from\n    beyond the sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], who had made a present of\n    it to Thoas. Eueneus son of Jason had given it to Patroklos in ransom of\n    Priam's son Lykaon, and Achilles now offered it as a prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] in honor of his comrade to him who should be\n    the swiftest runner. For the second prize he offered a large ox, well fattened,\n    while for the last there was to be half a talent of gold. He then rose and said\n    among the Argives, \"Stand forward, you who will essay this contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"754\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith uprose fleet Ajax son of Oileus, with\n    cunning Odysseus, and Nestor's son Antilokhos, the fastest runner among all the\n    youth of his time. They stood side by side and Achilles showed them the goal.\n    The course was set out for them from the starting-post, and the son of Oileus\n    took the lead at once, with Odysseus as close behind him as the shuttle is to a\n    woman's bosom when she throws the woof across the warp and holds it close up to\n    her; even so close behind him was Odysseus - treading in his footprints before\n    the dust could settle there, and Ajax could feel his breath on the back of his\n    head as he ran swiftly on. The Achaeans all shouted approval as they saw him\n    straining his utmost, and cheered him as he shot past them; but when they were\n    now nearing the end of the course Odysseus prayed inwardly to Athena. \"Hear\n    me,\" he cried, \"and help my feet, O goddess.\" Thus did he pray, and Pallas\n    Athena heard his prayer; she made his hands and his feet feel light, and when\n    the runners were at the point of pouncing upon the prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>], Ajax, through Athena's spite slipped upon some offal that\n    was lying there from the cattle which Achilles had slaughtered in honor of\n    Patroklos, and his mouth and nostrils were all filled with cow dung. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"778\" unit=\"line\"/>Odysseus therefore carried off the mixing-bowl,\n    for he got before Ajax and came in first. But Ajax took the ox and stood with\n    his hand on one of its horns, spitting the dung out of his mouth. Then he said\n    to the Argives, \"Alas, the goddess has spoiled my running; she watches over\n    Odysseus and stands by him as though she were his own mother.\" Thus did he\n    speak and they all of them laughed heartily. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"785\" unit=\"line\"/>Antilokhos carried off the last prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] and smiled as he said to the bystanders, \"You\n    all see, my friends, that now too the gods have shown their respect for\n    seniority. Ajax is somewhat older than I am, and as for Odysseus, he belongs to\n    an earlier generation, but he is hale in spite of his years, and no man of the\n    Achaeans can run against him save only Achilles.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"793"},{"n":"793","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"793\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"793\" unit=\"line\"/>He said this to pay a compliment to the son of\n    Peleus, and Achilles answered, \"Antilokhos, you shall not have given me praise\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ainos</term>] to no purpose; I shall give you an\n    additional half talent of gold.\" He then gave the half talent to Antilokhos,\n    who received it gladly. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"798\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the son of Peleus brought out to the\n    assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] the spear, helmet, and shield that\n    had been borne by Sarpedon, and were taken from him by Patroklos. He stood up\n    and said among the Argives, \"We bid two champions put on their armor, take\n    their keen blades, and make trial of one another in the presence of the\n    multitude; whichever of them can first wound the flesh of the other, cut\n    through his armor, and draw blood, to him will I give this goodly Thracian\n    sword inlaid with silver, which I took from Asteropaios, but the armor let both\n    hold in partnership, and I will give each of them a hearty meal in my own\n    tent.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"811\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith uprose great Ajax the son of Telamon,\n    as also mighty Diomedes son of Tydeus. When they had put on their armor each on\n    his own side of the ring, they both went into the middle eager to engage, and\n    with fire flashing from their eyes. The Achaeans marveled as they beheld them,\n    and when the two were now close up with one another, thrice did they spring\n    forward and thrice try to strike each other in close combat. <milestone n=\"818\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax pierced Diomedes' round shield, but did not draw blood,\n    for the cuirass beneath the shield protected him; thereon the son of Tydeus\n    from over his huge shield kept aiming continually at Ajax's neck with the point\n    of his spear, and the Achaeans alarmed for his safety bade them leave off\n    fighting and divide the prize between them. Achilles then gave the great sword\n    to the son of Tydeus, with its scabbard, and the leathern belt with which to\n    hang it. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"826\" unit=\"line\"/>Achilles next offered the massive iron quoit\n    which mighty Eetion had erewhile been used to hurl, until Achilles had slain\n    him and carried it off in his ships along with other spoils. He stood up and\n    said among the Argives, \"Stand forward, you who would essay this contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>]. He who wins it will have a store of iron that\n    will last him five years as they go rolling round, and if his fair fields lie\n    far from a town his shepherd or ploughman will not have to make a journey to\n    buy iron, for he will have a stock of it on his own premises.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"836\" unit=\"line\"/>Then uprose the two mighty men Polypoites and\n    Leonteus, with Ajax son of Telamon and noble Epeios. They stood up one after\n    the other and Epeios took the quoit, whirled it, and flung it from him, which\n    set all the Achaeans laughing. After him threw Leonteus of the race of Ares.\n    Ajax son of Telamon threw third, and sent the quoit beyond any mark [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] that had been made yet, but when mighty\n    Polypoites took the quoit he hurled it as though it had been a stockman's stick\n    which he sends flying about among his cattle when he is driving them, so far\n    did his throw out-distance those of the others in the contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>]. All who saw it roared approval, and his\n    comrades carried the prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] for him and set\n    it on board his ship. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"850\" unit=\"line\"/>Achilles next offered a prize of iron for\n    archery - ten double-edged axes and ten with single eddies: he set up a ship's\n    mast, some way off upon the sands, and with a fine string tied a pigeon to it\n    by the foot; this was what they were to aim at. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"850\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Whoever,\" he said, \"can hit the pigeon shall\n    have all the axes and take them away with him; he who hits the string without\n    hitting the bird will have taken a worse aim and shall have the single-edged\n    axes.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"859\" unit=\"line\"/>Then uprose King Teucer, and Meriones the\n    stalwart squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of Idomeneus rose also,\n    They cast lots in a bronze helmet and the lot of Teucer fell first. He let fly\n    with his arrow forthwith, but he did not promise hecatombs of firstling lambs\n    to King Apollo, and missed his bird, for Apollo foiled his aim; but he hit the\n    string with which the bird was tied, near its foot; the arrow cut the string\n    clean through so that it hung down towards the ground, while the bird flew up\n    into the sky, and the Achaeans shouted approval. Meriones, who had his arrow\n    ready while Teucer was aiming, snatched the bow out of his hand, and at once\n    promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to Apollo lord\n    of the bow; then espying the pigeon high up under the clouds, he hit her in the\n    middle of the wing as she was circling upwards; the arrow went clean through\n    the wing and fixed itself in the ground at Meriones' feet, but the bird perched\n    on the ship's mast hanging her head and with all her feathers drooping; the\n    life went out of her, and she fell heavily from the mast. Meriones, therefore,\n    took all ten double-edged axes, while Teucer bore off the single-edged ones to\n    his ships. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"884"},{"n":"884","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"884\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"884\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the son of Peleus brought in to the\n    contest [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] a spear and a cauldron that had\n    never been on the fire; it was worth an ox, and was chased with a pattern of\n    flowers; and those that throw the javelin stood up - to wit the son of Atreus,\n    king of men Agamemnon, and Meriones, stalwart squire of Idomeneus. But Achilles\n    spoke saying, \"Son of Atreus, we know how far you excel all others both in\n    power and in throwing the javelin; take the cauldron as prize [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] back with you to your ships, but if it so\n    please you, let us give the spear to Meriones; this at least is what I should\n    myself wish.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"895\" unit=\"line\"/>King Agamemnon assented.
