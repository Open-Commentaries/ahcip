[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.229357","title":"Odyssey 14","body":"<p>Now that he has finally returned to his homeland of Ithaca, Odysseus must accomplish another kind of return: he must be restored to kingship. Such a restoration, however, must start from the bottom up. The goddess Athena, his ultimate benefactor but occasional antagonist, has made Odysseus seem to be base on the outside, hiding his inner moral nobility. Only those who are likewise morally noble will be able to read, as it were, the hero’s true nature. Meanwhile, the coded tales told by Odysseus point toward the truth of his kingship—without revealing it outright. A telling example here in Rhapsody 14 is the second Cretan tale told by Odysseus: it is about a Cretan princeling, not unlike the dapper figure we see in the romanticized restoration of a Minoan fresco as featured in the cover-illustration for Rhapsody 14.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Knossos_frise2_1280.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Minoan—probably Neopalatial—fresco commonly known as the “Lily Prince.” Whatever the exact type of this personage (perhaps a crowned acrobat, according to the interpretation of Maria Shaw), the Lily Prince is certainly a Minoan of elite standing.

Odysseus, disguising himself as a Cretan princeling, begins with a statement about his origins. He says he is from Crete. In the singular, <em>Krētē</em> refers to the island of Crete. But here at O.14.199 we see the plural <em>Krêtai</em>, which cannot mean a multiplicity of islands named Crete. There is no such thing. Rather, we see here an elliptic plural, meaning ‘Crete and everything that belongs to it’. And of course whatever belongs to Crete are all the Aegean islands and lands controlled by the thalassocracy of Crete (HTL 163–164, following Muellner 1976:70). At O.19.178, we will see a pronoun that refers to Crete, and, like the noun <em>Krêtai</em> here at O.14.199, that pronoun too appears not in the singular but in the plural. So, again at O.19.178, we will see an elliptic plural. Also, in the comment on O.07.078–081, I noted a parallel example: it is the elliptic plural <em>Athênai</em>, which means ‘<em>Athēnē</em> and everything that belongs to it’. My translation here shows ‘it’ instead of ‘her’ for a simple reason: the fact is, the singular form <em>Athēnē</em> refers not only to the goddess Athena but also to the place that she personifies. As we see at O.07.080, the noun <em>Athēnē</em> in the singular can refer not only to the goddess Athena but also to the place that she controls, which was primarily the acropolis of Athens. So, to put that singular form into the plural, which is an elliptic plural, is a way of referring to all the places controlled by the acropolis of Athens. Besides <em>Athênai</em> in the sense of ‘Athens’, other such elliptic plurals include <em>Mukênai</em> ‘Mycenae’ and <em>Thêbai</em> ‘Thebes’. See the comment on O.07.078–081 (see also, again, HTL 163-164). On ellipsis in general, see the comment on I.04.196; also on I.06.209, I.07.015–017.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.199","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"ellipsis"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"elliptic plural"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230340","title":"Odyssey 14.199","body":"<p>in a list of attestations of genos eukhesthai einai and its transformations and analysis of the archaism in this verse</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.199","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230388","title":"Odyssey 14.204","body":"<p>contrast between Telemachus and Odysseus disguised as a nobleman who has fallen on hard times in their use of phanai and eukhesthai, respectively, in speaking of their genos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.204","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230452","title":"Odyssey 14.204","body":"<p>in a list of attestations of genos eukhesthai einai and its transformations</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.204","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230501","title":"Odyssey 14.204","body":"<p>example of the pairing of question and answer regarding identity (between man and god) in Ancient Greek that matches the Avestan model</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.204","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230551","title":"Odyssey 14.283-14.284","body":"<p>analysis of the passages in the Odyssey that imply that a basic component of the story of Odysseus’ return, the massacre of the suitors, is a variant of the mēnis theme</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.283-14.284","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230596","title":"Odyssey 14.283","body":"<p>association of (a verbal derivative of) opis and mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.283","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230646","title":"Odyssey 14.283","body":"<p>in the list of offenses that (threaten to) incur mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.283","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230694","title":"Odyssey 14.337","body":"<p>See the comment on O.14.063.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.337","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"endukéōs ‘continuously, uninterruptedly’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230741","title":"Odyssey 14.371","body":"<p>The theme of abduction by gusts of winds is analyzed at length in the comment at O.15.250–251.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.371","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"abduction by gusts of wind"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"harpuiai ‘rapacious gusts of wind, Harpies’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.230807","title":"Odyssey 14.403","body":"<p>This expression <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em> ‘throughout humankind’ is conventionally associated with words referring to remembrance by way of song.

Here the meaning of <em>ainos</em> can be interpreted in a general poetic sense, as &#x27;coded words&#x27;-a ‘coded message’. But there is also a specific poetic sense that is conveyed by the same word: an <em>ainos</em> can be festive, highlighting the merriment of song and dance. The same kind of festivity is formalized also in the victory odes of Pindar, where the medium of the odes can refer to itself by way of the same word, ainos, as we see for example in the case of <em>Olympian</em> 11.7. See also the general comment on O.09.003–011 and the specific comment there on the word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’ at O.09.006. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer again here to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.508","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"ainos 'coded words; fable'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.232404","title":"Odyssey 14.520","body":"<p>analysis of the non-formulaic eukhesthai introducing this speech, which is nevertheless analogous to formula (X) (death eukhesthai), though it is not followed by a death announcement but an adventure tale (traditional function aborted by genre-suppression) [MRBTP: 'ff']</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.520","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.282879","title":"Odyssey 14.216","body":"<p>(What follows is epitomized from HPC 289–290, where I offer supplementary bibliography.) A comparable pairing of Ares and Athena as divinities of war is found at I.18.515–519. See the comments on those lines. As I noted already in those comments, such a pairing of Ares and Athena is so old as to be traceable all the way back to the Bronze Age. Here I offer some details. As we know from the documentary evidence of the Linear B tablets found in the palace of Knossos in Crete, the divinities Athena and Ares (in that order) are paired as symmetrical recipients of offerings: in one tablet, V 52, a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja is listed together with e-nu-wa-ri-jo and pa-ja-wo-ne and po-se-da-o-ne. I interpret these syllabic spellings as follows: a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja = <em>Athānāi potniāi</em> or perhaps <em>Athānās potniā </em>(see the comment on O.07.078–081), e-nu-wa-ri-jo = <em>Enūaliōi</em>, pa-ja-wo-ne = <em>Paiāwonei</em>, po-se-da-o-ne = <em>Poseidāonei</em>. As we know from the evidence of Homeric diction, the divine name <em>Enūalios</em> became an epithet of Ares, as we see for example at I.18.211. In some Homeric contexts, as at I.20.069, <em>Enūalios</em> is a god in his own right, distinct from Ares, just as <em>Paiāwōn</em> (Homeric <em>Paiēōn</em>) is in some contexts distinct from Apollo, as at I.05.401, I.05.899–900. As for the name of Ares, it too is attested in the Linear B tablets, Knossos Fp 14 and Fp 5816, in the form a-re = <em>Arei</em>. The Cretan connection of Athena and Ares is attested here at O.14.216 as well, where Odysseus in the second of his “Cretan lies” represents himself as a Cretan prince who professes his devotion to these two divinities in moments of crisis in battle. I should add that the pairing of Ares and Athena in the world of images represented on the Shield of Achilles is expressed by way of bronzework that is overlaid with gold, I.18.517–519. Such a technique of metalwork, as narrated on the Shield, is notionally linked to the heroic age or, as archaeologists would say it, to the Bronze Age.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:14.216","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ares and Athena as divinities of war"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]}]
