If, however, you\n    are one of the immortals and have come down from heaven, I will not fight you;\n    for even valiant Lycurgus, son of Dryas, did not live long when he took to\n    fighting with the gods.

If, then, you would\n    learn my descent, it is one that is well known to many.

He was the son of\n    Aeolus, and had a son named Glaukos, who was father to Bellerophon, whom heaven\n    endowed with the most surpassing comeliness and beauty. But Proetus devised his\n    ruin, and being stronger than he, drove him from the district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] of the Argives, over which Zeus had made him\n    ruler. For Antaea, wife of Proetus, lusted after him, and would have had him\n    lie with her in secret; but Bellerophon was an honorable man and would not, so\n    she told lies about him to Proetus. ‘Proetus,’ said she, ‘kill Bellerophon or\n    die, for he would have had converse with me against my will.’ The king was\n    angered, but shrank from killing Bellerophon, so he sent him to <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName> bearing baneful signs [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêmata</term>], written inside a folded tablet and containing\n    much ill against the bearer. He bade Bellerophon show these written signs to\n    his father-in-law, to the end that he might thus perish; Bellerophon therefore\n    went to <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, and the gods convoyed\n    him safely.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"172\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When he reached the river <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName>, which is in <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, the king received him with all\n    goodwill, feasted him nine days, and killed nine heifers in his honor, but when\n    rosy-fingered morning appeared upon the tenth day, he questioned him and\n    desired to see the written signs [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêmata</term>] from his\n    son-in-law Proetus. When he had received the wicked written signs [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêmata</term>] he first commanded Bellerophon to kill that\n    savage monster, the Chimaera, who was not a human being, but a goddess, for she\n    had the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent, while her body was that of a\n    goat, and she breathed forth flames of fire; but Bellerophon slew her, for he\n    was guided by signs from heaven. He next fought the far-famed Solymoi, and\n    this, he said, was the hardest of all his battles.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"186\" unit=\"line\"/>Thirdly, he killed the Amazons, women who were\n    the peers of men, and as he was returning thence the king devised yet another\n    plan for his destruction; he picked [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] the\n    bravest warriors in all <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, and\n    placed them in ambuscade, but not a man ever came back, for Bellerophon killed\n    every one of them. Then the king knew that he must be the valiant offspring of\n    a god, so he kept him in <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, gave\n    him his daughter in marriage, and made him of equal honor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">timê</term>] in the kingdom with himself; and the Lycians gave him a piece\n    of land, the best in all the country, fair with vineyards and tilled fields, to\n    have and to hold. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"196\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The king's daughter bore Bellerophon three\n    children, Isandros, Hippolokhos, and Laodameia. Zeus, the lord of counsel, lay\n    with Laodameia, and she bore him noble Sarpedon; but when Bellerophon came to\n    be hated by all the gods, he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the Alean\n    plain, gnawing at his own heart, and shunning the path of man. Ares, insatiate\n    of battle, killed his son Isandros while he was fighting the Solymi; his\n    daughter was killed by Artemis of the golden reins, for she was angered with\n    her; but Hippolokhos was father to myself, and when he sent me to <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> he urged me again and again to fight\n    ever among the foremost and outvie my peers, so as not to shame the blood of my\n    fathers who were the noblest in <placeName key=\"perseus,Ephyra\">Ephyra</placeName> and in all <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>.

Opposite these, on the other side the\n    courtyard, there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for Priam's\n    daughters, built near one another, where his sons-in-law slept with their\n    wives. When Hektor got there, his fond mother came up to him with Laodike the\n    fairest of her daughters.

Get the matrons together, and go\n    with offerings to the temple of Athena driver of the spoil; there, upon the\n    knees of Athena, lay the largest and fairest robe you have in your house - the\n    one you set most store by; promise, moreover, to sacrifice twelve yearling\n    heifers that have never yet felt the goad, in the temple of the goddess if she\n    will take pity on the town, with the wives and little ones of the Trojans, and\n    keep the son of Tydeus from off the goodly city of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, for he fights with fury, and fills men's souls with\n    panic.

Hektor had named him\n    Skamandrios, but the people called him Astyanax, for his father stood alone as\n    chief guardian of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>. Hektor smiled\n    as he looked upon the boy, but he did not speak, and Andromache stood by him\n    weeping and taking his hand in her own. \"Dear husband,\" said she, \"your valor\n    will bring you to destruction; think on your infant son, and on my hapless self\n    who ere long shall be your widow - for the Achaeans will set upon you in a body\n    and kill you.

I have neither father nor\n    mother now. Achilles slew my father when he sacked Thebe the goodly city of the\n    Cilicians. He slew him, but did not for very shame despoil him; when he had\n    burned him in his wondrous armor, he raised a barrow over his ashes and the\n    mountain nymphs, daughters of aegis-bearing Zeus, planted a grove of elms about\n    his tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>]. I had seven brothers in my\n    father's house, but on the same day they all went within the house of Hades.\n    Achilles killed them as they were with their sheep and cattle. My mother - her\n    who had been queen of all the land under Mount Plakos - he brought hither with\n    the spoil, and freed her for a great sum, but the archer - queen Artemis took\n    her in the house of your father.

I cannot do so: I know nothing save to fight\n    bravely in the forefront of the Trojan host and win renown [kleos] alike for my\n    father and myself.

His father and mother laughed to see him, but Hektor took the helmet\n    from his head and laid it all gleaming upon the ground. Then he took his\n    darling child,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"474\" unit=\"line\"/>kissed him, and dandled him in his arms,\n    praying over him the while to Zeus and to all the gods. \"Zeus,\" he cried,\n    \"grant that this my child may be even as myself, chief among the Trojans; let\n    him be not less excellent in strength, and let him rule <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> with his might.

As\n    her husband watched her his heart yearned towards her and he caressed her\n    fondly, saying, \"My own wife, do not take these things too bitterly to heart.\n    No one can hurry me down to Hades before my time, but if a man's hour is come,\n    be he brave or be he coward, there is no escape for him when he has once been\n    born.

When she reached her home she found her maidens within, and bade\n    them all join in her lament; so they mourned Hektor in his own house though he\n    was yet alive, for they deemed that they should never see him return safe from\n    battle, and from the furious hands of the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"503\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7008038\">Paris</placeName> did not remain long in his\n    house.
