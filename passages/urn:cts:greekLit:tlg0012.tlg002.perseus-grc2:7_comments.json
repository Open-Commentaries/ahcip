In terms of this definition, the name <em>Athḗnē</em> refers not only to the goddess ‘Athena’ but also to everything that belongs to the goddess. The primary example of that ‘everything’ in this context is the acropolis of Athens. And we see another level of ellipsis in the plural form <em>Athênai</em>: this elliptic plural refers not only to the acropolis of Athens but also to everything that belongs to the acropolis of Athens, which is the city of Athens, and, by extension, to everything that belongs to the city, which is ultimately the region of Attica.<a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\">[5]</a></p>\r\n<p>I see a parallel situation in the use of the form <em>Aswia</em> (/<em>Aswiās</em>) in the Linear B texts, where Aswia is evidently a goddess, as we see from the collocation <em>po-ti-ni-ja a-si-wi-ja</em> = <em>potnia Aswia</em> ‘[Our] Lady Aswia’ as written on a tablet from Pylos, Fr 1208. In the case of Aswia, the name survives into the classical period of recorded texts in the fifth century BCE and later: now the name is pronounced <em>Asíā</em>, meaning ‘Asia’, and the referent here is what we call ‘Asia Minor’ in English. So, from a diachronic perspective, this name applies both to the goddess and to the realm of the goddess. She is ‘Our Lady of Asia’ or ‘Asia’ personified.</p>\r\n<p>I emphasize here that the form <em>Athḗnē</em> at line 80 of <em>Odyssey</em> 7 is the only instance, in all surviving texts ever written in the ancient Greek language, where the name of  the place ‘Athens’ is found in the singular, not in the plural. Everywhere else in attested Greek, we read the elliptic plural <em>Athênai</em>, which I now interpret to mean ‘everything that belongs to the acropolis of <em>Athḗnē</em>’. And there is also a deeper level of ellipsis here: the suffix <em>-ḗnē</em> of <em>Athḗnē</em> indicates that the goddess Athena is also a personification of the place of Athena, which is the acropolis of Athens and, by extension, the city of Athens, and by further extension, everything that belongs to the city of Athens.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a> Commentary in Nagy 2004:159-164.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a> See Nagy 2004:163; also Palaiologou 2013:250n5. </p>\r\n<p><a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\">[3]</a> Nagy 2004:163n17.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\">[4]</a> Again, Nagy 2004:163n17.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\">[5]</a> See also Muellner 1976:70, who notes that the singular form of <em>Athḗnē</em> vs. the plural form <em>Athênai</em> can in fact refer to the place that we know as 'Athens'.

See the comment at O.04.043–075. I now argue here that the garden of Alkinoos, described at O.07.112–132, is likewise presented as a heavenly place. At O.07.103–130, where we see verses that overlap the descriptions of the palace and the garden, we find that the describing verbs avoid the past tense. The descriptions are restricted to the present tense. It has been argued that a textual interpolation has happened here (West 2000:480), on the grounds that Homeric diction does not use the present tense to indicate the past, and that only those aspects of the past that are viewed as permanent can be described in the present tense: examples include the chariot of Hera, I.05.724–728; the abode of Poseidon under the sea at Aigai, I.13.021–022; the springs of the river Scamander, I.22.147–154; the harbor and cave of the Nymphs at Ithaca, O.13.096–112; and, most important for my argumentation here, the dwelling-place of the gods on Mount Olympus, O.06.043–046. Arguing against the theory of interpolation, I propose that not only the palace of Alkinoos but also his garden are modeled on an idealized and thus heavenly prototype. Both the palace and the garden are models of permanence. In the case of the palace, its permanence is actually made explicit in a reference at O.07.091–094 to golden and silver watchdogs that guard the palace and that are made to last forever by the divine smith Hephaistos. The aura of this beautiful place is not only enchanting but even enchanted. In terms of my argument, then, there is no need to posit (as does West 2000:483–486) a textual interpolation from an unattested passage that would have followed what is spoken by Nausicaa at O.06.255–303 with reference to the palace of Alkinoos and its environs. The present tenses that are used in descriptions of the palace and the garden at O.07.081–111 and 112–132 respectively are appropriate to the heavenly aura of the whole place.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:7.81-7.132","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"present-tense descriptions of permanence"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"palace and garden of Alkinoos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.205980","title":"Odyssey 7.137-7.138","body":"<p>comment on the nature of the return expected when making a libation that can be either implicit and ordained by custom or made explicit verbally, with this verse as the only place where the addressee (Hermes) is explained</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:7.137-7.138","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.206044","title":"Odyssey 7.162-7.166","body":"<p>analysis of the functional overlap between hiketēs and xeinos, argument that in Homer hiketēs still means ‘he who comes, arrives’</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:7.162-7.166","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.206093","title":"Odyssey 7.167","body":"<p>Alkinoos here qualifies for an epithet that would mean ‘he whose mental-power [<em>menos</em>] is sacred [<em>hieron</em>]’.

The point of this description may be related to the poetic agenda of the <em>Odyssey</em> in describing the kingdom of the Phaeacians as a mythological replica of the confederation known as the Ionian Dodecapolis as it existed around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405.) For a reconstruction of the poetic agenda originating from the Ionian Dodecapolis around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE, I recommend the analysis of Frame 2009 ch. 7. (As for a relatively later phase of the poetic agenda, where the kingdom of Alkinoos is reshaped as a mythological replica of the island-state of Kerkyra / Corcyra, I refer to my initial comments on Rhapsody 7 of the <em>Odyssey</em>, where I cross-refer to my further comments on Rhapsody 11.) From the standpoint of Ionian Dodecapolis, dominated by the city-state of Miletus in Asia Minor, the island of Euboea was situated far away to the west. The territory of Euboea was shared by two rival Ionian cities, Eretria and Khalkis, and the first of the two was a close ally of Miletus. The distancing of the Ionian Dodecapolis from Ionian Euboea could be explained as a playfully ostentatious reference to the far reach of East Greeks in dealing with West Greeks. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:7.321","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Euboea"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ionian Dodecapolis"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.282826","title":"Odyssey 7.078-081","body":"<p>|78 ὣς ἄρα φωνήσασ’ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη |79 πόντον ἐπ’ ἀτρύγετον, λίπε δὲ Σχερίην ἐρατεινήν, |80 ἵκετο δ’ ἐς Μαραθῶνα καὶ εὐρυάγυιαν Ἀθήνην, |81 δῦνε δ’ Ἐρεχθῆος πυκινὸν δόμον. αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς |82 Ἀλκινόου πρὸς δώματ’ ἴε κλυτά· </p><p>|78 Speaking thus, Athena [<em>Athḗnē</em>], with the looks of an owl, went off |79 over the barren sea, leaving behind lovely Skheria. |80 She came to Marathon and to Athens [<em>Athḗnē</em>], with its wide causeways, |81 and she entered the well-built palace of Erekhtheus. As for Odysseus, |81 he headed for the renowned palace of Alkinoos.</p><p>[The comments that follow are epitomized from Nagy 2015.09.10§§6–9.] At O.07.078, we see the name <em>Athḗnē</em> for the goddess Athena. At O.07.080 we see the same name <em>Athēnē</em> for the place that is known in historical times as the city of Athens. As a place-name, <em>Athḗnē</em> is attested only here in the singular. Everywhere else, in the entire surviving textual evidence of the Greek language, this place-name is attested only in the plural, <em>Athênai</em>. The plural has an elliptic function, but I think that even the suffix -<em>ḗnē</em> of <em>Athḗnē</em> is elliptic. Here is a working definition of ellipsis: a form that is <em>elliptic</em> refers not only to X but also to everything that belongs to X, such as X2, X3, X4 etc. An elliptic form of X implies X2, X3, X4 etc. without naming X2, X3, X4 etc. explicitly. In terms of this definition, the name <em>Athḗnē</em> refers not only to the goddess ‘Athena’ but also to everything that belongs to the goddess. An example of such ‘everything’ would be the acropolis of Athens. And we see a further level of ellipsis in the plural form <em>Athênai</em>: this elliptic plural refers not only to the acropolis of Athens but also to everything that belongs to the acropolis, and that everything becomes the city of Athens. Eventually, the ellipsis extends to everything that belongs to the city, which is ultimately the region of Attica. Earlier, however, in the second millennium BCE, the extended region of Attica was not yet dominated by Athens. And a rival dominant power in Attica was Marathon, mentioned here at O.07.80 as an alternative residence of the goddess Athena. But even if Athena had alternative residences in Attica, only in one place did she have a condominium, as it were, with Erekhtheus, and that place was the acropolis of Athens. On the relationship of the goddess Athena with the hero Erekhtheus, see the comment on I.02.546–552. Comparable to the name <em>Athḗnē</em> is the name of the nymph or local goddess <em>Mukḗnē</em>, who presides over the acropolis of Mycenae. As for the elliptic plural <em>Mukênai</em>, it must refer not only to the acropolis but also to the region dominated by the acropolis. Another comparable form is the place-name <em>Messḗnē</em>, which means something like ‘Midland’. Here I compare the place-name me-za-na written on a Linear B tablet from Pylos, Cn 3.1. And here is another relevant piece of information from the Linear B texts: in a tablet from Knossos, V 52, the name of a female divinity in line one is a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja, which I interpret as <em>athānās potniāi</em> ‘to the lady [<em>potnia</em>] of Athens’. I translate <em>athānā</em> here as ‘Athens’, by which I mean simply the acropolis of Athens as it existed as far back as the second millennium BCE.
