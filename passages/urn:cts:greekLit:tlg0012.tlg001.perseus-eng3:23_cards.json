For Aias is but a little older than I,<milestone n=\"790\" unit=\"line\"/>whereas Odysseus is of an earlier generation and of earlier men—a green old age is his, men say—yet hard were he for any other Achaean to contend with in running, save only for Achilles.\n    </quote>\n    So spake he,and gave glory to the son of Peleus, swift of foot. And Achilles made answer, and spake to him, saying:<milestone n=\"795\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    <quote>Antilochus, not in vain shall thy word of praise be spoken; nay, I will add to thy prize a half-talent of gold.\n    </quote>\n    So saying, he set it in his hands, and Antilochus received it gladly. But the son of Peleus brought and set in the place of gathering a far-shadowing spear, and therewith a shield and helmet,<milestone n=\"800\" unit=\"line\"/>the battlegear of Sarpedon, that Patroclus stripped from him; and he stood up, and spake among the Argives, saying:\n    <quote>To win these prizes invite we warriors twain, the best there are, to clothe them in their armour and take bronze that cleaveth the flesh, and so make trial each of the other before the host.<milestone n=\"805\" unit=\"line\"/>Whoso of the twain shall first reach the other's fair flesh, and touch the inward parts through armour and dark blood, to him will I give this silver-studded sword—a goodly Thracian sword which I took from Asteropaeus; and these arms let the twain bear away to hold in common;<milestone n=\"810\" unit=\"line\"/>and a goodly banquet shall we set before them in our huts.\n    </quote>\n    So spake he, and thereat arose great Telamonian Aias, and up rose the son of Tydeus, stalwart Diomedes. So when they had armed them on either side of the throng, into the midst strode the twain, eager for battle,<milestone n=\"815\" unit=\"line\"/>glaring terribly; and amazement held all the Achaeans. But when they were come near as they advance done against the other, thrice they set upon each other, and thrice they clashed together. Then Aias thrust upon the shield, that was well-balanced upon every side, but reached not the flesh, for the corselet within kept off the spear.<milestone n=\"820\" unit=\"line\"/>But Tydeus' son over the great shield sought ever to reach the neck with the point of his shining spear. Then verily the Achaeans, seized with fear for Aias, bade them cease and take up equal prizes. Howbeit to Tydeus' son the warrior gave the great sword,<milestone n=\"825\" unit=\"line\"/>bringing it with its scabbard and its well-cut baldric.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"826"},{"n":"826","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"826\">\n    <p>\n    Then the son of Peleus set forth a mass of rough-cast iron, which of old the mighty strength of Eëtion was wont to hurl; but him had swift-footed goodly Achilles slain, and bare this away on his ships with his other possessions.<milestone n=\"830\" unit=\"line\"/>And he stood up, and spake among the Argives, saying :\n    <quote>Up now, ye that will make essay likewise in this contest.

Then they took their places in order, and goodly Epeius grasped the mass,<milestone n=\"840\" unit=\"line\"/>and whirled and flung it; and all the Achaeans laughed aloud thereat. Then in turn Leonteus, scion of Ares, made a cast; and thirdly great Telamonian Aias hurled it from his strong hand, and sent it past the marks of all. But when Polypoetes, staunch in fight,<milestone n=\"845\" unit=\"line\"/>grasped the mass, far as a herdsman flings his crook, and it flieth whirling over the herds of kine, even so far cast he it beyond all the gathering; and the folk shouted aloud.

Forthwith he let fly an arrow with might, howbeit he vowed not that he would sacrifice to the king a glorious hecatomb of firstling lambs.<milestone n=\"865\" unit=\"line\"/>So he missed the bird, for Apollo grudged him that, but hit the cord beside its foot wherewith the bird was tied, and clean away the bitter arrow cut the cord. Then the dove darted skyward, and the cord hung loose toward earth; and the Achaeans shouted aloud.<milestone n=\"870\" unit=\"line\"/>But Meriones speedily snatched the bow from Teucer's hand—an arrow had he long been holding while Teucer aimed—and vowed forthwith that he would sacrifice to Apollo that smiteth afar a glorious hecatomb of firstling lambs.

Up rose the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon and Meriones, the valiant squire of Idomeneus.
