That pollution was the unintended death of an infant hero named Dēmophōn. The queen of Eleusis, mother of this infant hero, had unintentionally ruined the plan of the goddess Demeter to make Dēmophōn exempt from death. That moment happens when the queen interrupts Demeter in the sacred act of dipping the infant Dēmophōn into the fire of the household fireplace in order to galvanize this infant into a state of immortality (<em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 239-250). Here I quote the passage that tells about the immediate aftermath, where the goddess angrily condemns the error of the queen and announces that the infant hero Dēmophōn will now be subject to death, like all other mortals.

In this narrative about the Silver Generation (<em>Works and Days</em> 127-142), the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em> shows the dark side of cult heroes: the heroes of the Silver Generation refuse to ‘care for’ the gods, <em>therapeuein</em> (135), and they likewise refuse to perform sacrifices to the gods (136). But, despite such impious behavior, which is equated with not giving <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, to the gods (138), these heroes of the Silver Generation are said to receive <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, from humans after they die, just as the heroes of the Golden Generation receive honor (142). And, taken from the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (259-267), this word <em>tīmē</em> can refer to the ‘honor’ that cult heroes receive in the rituals of hero cult after they die, as in the case of the <em>tīmē</em> received by the cult hero Demophon after he dies (261, 263). As we can see in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (268), where the goddess refers to herself as <em>tīmāokhos</em>, ‘receiver of honor’ [<em>tīmē</em>], the gods receive tīmē just as cult heroes receive tīmē, but of course they do not have to die to receive it as heroes have to die. And the heroes of the Silver Generation do have to die, as we have just seen in the text I quoted. So, once again, I apply the formula: <strong>god-hero antagonism in myth corresponds to god-hero symbiosis in ritual</strong>.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002:2.259-2.267","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.254635","title":"Homeric Hymns To Demeter 259-267","body":"<p>comparison of Erichtonios/Erechtheus with Demophoon and the latter as a model of lost immortality for the former, here specifically the similarity of the annual festivals in their honor (cp.

In this case, the rituals take the form of an athletic competition that overtly simulates warfare. And these rituals will have to recur seasonally, year after year, for a notional eternity. Such a seasonal recurrence is indicated by the word <em>hōrā</em> at verse 265 of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>. And now we see why the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, that the prototypical hero receives in compensation for his death is described as <em>a-phthi-tos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (verse 263), that is, lasting forever. Another example of such a seasonally recurring ritual is a mock battle of boys competing within a sacralized space known as the <em>Platanistās</em>, ‘Grove of the Plane Trees’, in Sparta: this ritual is described by Pausanias (3.11.2, 3.14.8-9), who notes that the boys made sacrifice to the hero Achilles before they started their mock battle (3.20.8). </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002:2.263","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.255456","title":"Homeric Hymns To Demeter 265","body":"<p>comparison of Erichtonios/Erechtheus with Demophoon and the latter as a model of lost immortality for the former [MRBTP: 'f']</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002:2.265","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.255523","title":"Homeric Hymns To Demeter 265","body":"<p>comparison of Erichtonios/Erechtheus with Demophoon and the latter as a model of lost immortality for the former</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002:2.265","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.255574","title":"Homeric Hymn to Demeter 265","body":"<p>At the core of the narratives about <em>Hēraklēs</em> is the meaning of <em>hērōs</em>, ‘hero’, as a cognate of <em>Hērā</em>, the goddess of seasonality and equilibrium, and of <em>hōrā</em>, a noun that actually means ‘seasonality’ in the context of designating hero cult, as in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 265.
