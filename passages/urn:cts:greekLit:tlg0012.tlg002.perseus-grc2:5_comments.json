As for the first goddess, who is Calypso, her action in releasing Odysseus from their mutual love affair becomes another life-saver for him. That is because the chances of success for such an affair between a mortal man and an immortal goddess would have been minimal, as we will see by observing other myths that tell about other such affairs.

In the case of Ankhises, he is afflicted with some kind of paralysis. See the comment on <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218–238.

The White Goddess gives to Odysseus her <em>krēdemnon</em>, that is, her headdress or ‘veil’, which becomes his life-saver: O.05.346, O.05.351, O.05.373, O.05.459. In order to give the hero her headdress, she would first have to undo her hair, as we can see by comparing the scene where Andromache lets fall from her head her own headdress, the word for which is, here again, <em>krēdemnon</em>, I.22.470. See the commentary on I.22.460–474, where I noted that the undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I called an <em>Aphrodisiac effect</em>. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon </em>is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. Also, while saving the hero, the goddess assumes the form of a diving bird called <em>aithuia</em>, O.05.337 and O.05.353. These actions of Ino in saving Odysseus from the mortal dangers of the sea are parallel to the actions of the goddess Athena herself. [What follows is epitomized from Nagy 1985:80–81 (= §78).] Ino as <em>aithuia</em> has a parallel agent in ensuring the salvation of Odysseus from the sea: Athena herself redirects the storm sent against the hero by Poseidon, O.05.382–387, and then she saves him from immediate drowning by giving him a timely idea for swimming to safety, O.05.435–439. The hero submerges but then emerges from a wave that would surely have drowned him had it not been for Athena, O.05.435 and O.05.438, and this detail corresponds closely to the preceding emergence and submergence of Ino herself, O.05.337 and O.05.352–353. Such a correspondence suggests that Ino, the former mortal who is now a goddess, O.05.334 and O.05.335, is a model for a transition from death to life anew. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:5.333-5.353","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ino"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Leukotheā ‘White Goddess’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"krēdemnon ‘headdress’ or ‘veil’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.204497","title":"Odyssey 5.396","body":"<p>Here the verb <em>tēkesthai</em> ‘melt away’ refers to wasting away in illness.
