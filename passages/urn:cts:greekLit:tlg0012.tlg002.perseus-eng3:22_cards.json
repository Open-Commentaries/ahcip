And Eurymachus let the sword fall from his hand to the ground, and writhing over the table<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"85\" unit=\"line\"/>he bowed and fell, and spilt upon the floor the food and the two-handled cup.

But when the arrows failed the prince, as he shot,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"120\" unit=\"line\"/>he leaned the bow against the door-post of the well-built hall, and let it stand against the bright entrance wall. For himself, he put about his shoulders a four-fold shield, and set on his mighty head a well-wrought helmet with horse-hair plume, and terribly did the plume wave above him;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>and he took two mighty spears, tipped with bronze.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"126"},{"n":"126","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"126\">\n    <p>\n    Now there was in the well-built wall a certain postern door,<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> and along the topmost level of the threshold of the well-built hall was a way into a passage, and well-fitting folding doors closed it. This postern Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd watch,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"130\" unit=\"line\"/>taking his stand close by, for there was but a single way to reach it.

But come, let me bring you<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>from the store-room arms to don, for it is within, methinks, and nowhere else that Odysseus and his glorious son have laid the arms.”\n    So saying, Melanthius, the goatherd, mounted up by the steps<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">2</note> of the hall to the store-rooms of Odysseus.

How is it that now, when thou hast come to thy house and thine own possessions, thou shrinkest with wailing from playing the man, and that against the wooers? Nay, friend, come hither and take thy stand by my side, and see my deeds, that thou mayest know what manner of man<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>Mentor, son of Alcimus, is to repay kindness in the midst of the foe.”\n    She spoke, but did not give him strength utterly to turn the course of the battle, but still made trial of the might and valor of Odysseus and his glorious son; and for herself,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"240\" unit=\"line\"/>she flew up to the roof-beam of the smoky hall, and sat there in the guise of a swallow to look upon.\n    Now the wooers were urged on by Agelaus, son of Damastor, by Eurynomus, and Amphimedon and Demoptolemus and Peisander, son of Polyctor, and wise Polybus, for these were in valiance far the best of all the wooers<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"245\" unit=\"line\"/>who still lived and fought for their lives; but the rest the bow and the swiftly-falling arrows had by now laid low. But Agelaus spoke among them, and declared his word to all:\n    “Friends, now at length will this man stay his invincible hands. Lo, Mentor has gone from him, and has but uttered empty boasts,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"250\" unit=\"line\"/>and they are left alone there at the outer doors.

One man<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"275\" unit=\"line\"/>smote the door-post of the well-built hall, another the close-fitting door, another's ashen spear, heavy with bronze, struck upon the wall. But Amphimedon smote Telemachus on the hand by the wrist, a grazing blow, and the bronze tore the surface of the skin. And Ctesippus with his long spear<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"280\" unit=\"line\"/>grazed the shoulder of Eumaeus above his shield, but the spear flew over and fell upon the ground. Then once more Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and his company hurled their sharp spears into the throng of the wooers, and again Odysseus, the sacker of cities, smote Eurydamas, and Telemachus Amphimedon, the swineherd Polybus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"285\" unit=\"line\"/>and thereafter the herdsman of the cattle smote Ctesippus in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:\n    “Son of Polytherses, thou lover of revilings, never more at all do thou speak big, yielding to folly, but leave the matter to the gods, since verily they are mightier far.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"290\" unit=\"line\"/>This is thy gift of welcome to match the hoof which of late thou gavest to godlike Odysseus, when he went begging through the house.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"292"},{"n":"292","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"292\">\n    <p>\n    So spoke the herdsman of the sleek cattle.

Then Athena held up her aegis, the bane of mortals, on high from the roof, and the minds of the wooers were panic-stricken, and they fled through the halls like a herd of kine<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"300\" unit=\"line\"/>that the darting gad-fly falls upon and drives along in the season of spring, when the long days come.

And Telemachus is but newly grown to manhood, and his mother would not suffer him to rule over the women servants.

Then wise Telemachus was the first to speak to the others, saying:\n    “Let it be by no clean death that I take the lives of these women, who on my own head have poured reproaches and on my mother, and were wont to lie with the wooers.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"465"},{"n":"465","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"465\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>So he spoke, and tied the cable of a dark-prowed ship to a great pillar and flung it round the dome, stretching it on high that none might reach the ground with her feet.
