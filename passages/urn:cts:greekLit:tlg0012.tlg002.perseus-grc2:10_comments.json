So, they are traveling from west to east. At O.11.0028–030, we see that they have already sailed for nine days, and then, on the tenth day, Ithaca finally comes into view. But now Odysseus falls asleep at the steering oar, and his companions make the human error of opening the Bag of Winds, so that their ships are blown back, east to west—all the way back to where they started, to the island of Aeolus, O.10.031–055. Aeolus now refuses to help Odysseus and his companions any further, O.056–076, and, as they sail on, O.077–79, it is no longer clear where they are headed. No longer will they be propelled toward Ithaca by the favoring West Wind that Aeolus had provided for them earlier. Their sea voyage is now directionless, and, by the time their ship reaches the land of the Laestrygonians, they have already lost their navigational compass, since this land appears to be a twilight zone, O.080–086. The disorientation will only intensify later, after Odysseus and some of his companions manage to escape from the land of the Laestrygonians and sail to the island of Circe: see the comment on O.10.189–202. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.25-10.86","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eastward and westward sailing"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.216196","title":"Odyssey 10.27","body":"<p>example of Aeolus adventure as another instance of the “mindlessness” of the companions</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.27","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.216242","title":"Odyssey 10.30","body":"<p>association of Ithaka with sight of fire and smoke, the etymology of Ithakē connecting it to aithein, and Odysseus’ calling himself Aithōn (comparison with Hermes, who in turn is compared with Prometheus-Ithas)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.30","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.216287","title":"Odyssey 10.37","body":"<p>analysis of philotēs and timē going together with this passage as an example</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.37","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.216350","title":"Odyssey 10.46","body":"<p>example of Aeolus adventure as another instance of the “mindlessness” of the companions</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.46","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.216397","title":"Odyssey 10.65","body":"<p>Aeolus, god of the winds, tells Odysseus he is sending him off endukéōs, so that the hero could reach home. endukéōs is generally associated with the notion of an uninterrupted sequence.

So, the disorientation of Odysseus is linked with loss of <em>mētis</em>. Clearly, the mind of the hero is correlated here with the celestial dynamics of sunset and sunrise. See further the comment on O.10.190–102. (More on this subject in GMP 246.) In response to the hero’s expression of despair, his companions weep uncontrollably, O.10.198–202, and now all they can think about are the horrors they remember having experienced in their encounters with the Cyclops and with Antiphates the Laestrygonian, O.10.199–200. The epithet for one of these two monsters here, the Cyclops, is <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’, O.10.200, which suits not only the cannibalistic Cyclops but also Antiphates the Laestrygonian, who as can see at O.10.115–116 is likewise a cannibal. These memories of cannibalism are most telling, since the name of the Cyclops is linked here with the <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ of this monster, O.10.200. And the link surely extends to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. That monster too, like the Cyclops, is a negative exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’. And such memories evoke the worst moments of the story of the Trojan War as narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>, as when Achilles himself expresses the ghastly urge to eat the body of Hector raw, I.22.346–347. See the comment at I.22.346–348; also at I.23.001–064. So, Achilles as the primary exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ in the <em>Iliad</em> can be seen in this context as a foil for Odysseus as the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in the <em>Odyssey</em>. Even the Iliadic contexts of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ are evoked here, since Cyclops at O.10.200 is described not only as <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’ but also as <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’. Similarly at O.10.106, in an attested variant of that verse, this same description applies also to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. Beyond these two attestations, this epithet <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’ occurs nowhere else in the <em>Odyssey</em>, whereas it occurs regularly as a conventional description of generic warriors in the <em>Iliad</em>. That is why I propose to describe the horrific visions of cannibals in the <em>Odyssey</em> as Iliadic nightmares. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.189-10.202","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Antiphates the Laestrygonian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mētis ‘mind, intelligence’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"disorientation of Odysseus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Iliadic nightmares"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"megalētōr ‘having a heart that is mighty’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"androphagos 'man-eating'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Cyclops"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217153","title":"Odyssey 10.190-10.193","body":"<p>|190 ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ ἴδμεν ὅπῃ ζόφος οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἠώς, |191 οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἠέλιος φαεσίμβροτος εἶσ’ ὑπὸ γαῖαν |192 οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἀννεῖται· ἀλλὰ φραζώμεθα θᾶσσον, |193 εἴ τις ἔτ’ ἔσται μῆτις· ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ οἴομαι εἶναι.</p><p>|190 My friends, I am speaking this way because I do not know which place is west and which place is east |191 - which is the place where the sun, bringing light for mortals, goes underneath the earth |192 and which is the place where it rises.

When Odysseus reaches the island of Circe and learns that this place, though it first seems familiar and reminiscent of his own island, is in fact strange and alien and antithetical to home, he despairs. The hero feels he has no intelligence or <em>mētis</em>  left in him to devise a stratagem for a successful homecoming, and his despair is expressed as a feeling of disorientation. He is no longer able to distinguish between orient and occident. To restate in terms of two words used elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the hero is experiencing a loss of orientation in his <em>nóos</em> or ‘thinking’, and this loss is presently blocking his <em>nostos</em>, ‘homecoming’. Despite such moments of disorientation for Odysseus, however, his <em>nóos</em>, ‘thinking’ will ultimately reorient him, steering him away from his Iliadic past and toward his ultimate Odyssean future. That is, the hero’s <em>nóos</em> will make it possible for him to achieve a <em>nostos</em>, which is not only his ‘homecoming’ but also the ‘song about a homecoming’ that is the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.190-10.193","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"mētis ‘mind, intelligence’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217200","title":"Odyssey 10.190-10.192","body":"<p>Explanation of Odysseus’ odd description Circe’s land as “where the darkness is and where the dawn.” Circe’s land is equated with sunset when Odysseus ventures into “death and darkness” but with the dawn when he “returns to life and light”</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.190-10.192","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217247","title":"Odyssey 10.231","body":"<p>evidence of “witlessness” of the companions as a negative indication of the thematic presence of nóos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.231","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217311","title":"Odyssey 10.236","body":"<p>evidence for suggestion that collocations utilizing forms of lanthánomai with nóstos are semantically related to theme of a loss of “mind.” Comparison with intended effect of Circe’s drugs: to make the companion forget their homeland</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.236","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217362","title":"Odyssey 10.236","body":"<p>evidence for suggestion that collocations utilizing forms of lanthánomai with nóstos are semantically related to theme of a loss of “mind.” Comparison with intended effect of Circe’s drugs: to make the companion forget their homeland</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.236","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217409","title":"Odyssey 10.240","body":"<p>analysis of ambiguity about nature of companions who are turned into swine but retain their nóos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.240","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.217456","title":"Odyssey 10.245","body":"<p>See the anchor comment at O.04.489.

But the others [in Hādēs] just flit about, like shadows [<em>skiai</em>].</p><p>Circe describes for Odysseus what to expect when he sees Teiresias in Hādēs. Exceptionally, the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of the hero, O.10.492, will have consciousness: that is, his <em>phrenes</em> ‘thinking’ will be <em>empedoi</em> ‘grounded’, O.10.493. On <em>phrenes</em> in the sense of ‘thinking’, see the anchor comment at O.01.320, where I note that Homeric diction leaves room for the idea that you can think with your heart. But what is it that confers on the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Teiresias the exceptional power to think even when he is dead, in Hādēs? The answer is given at O.10.494–495: Persephone, queen of Hādēs, has exceptionally given permission for Teiresias to have the <em>nóos</em> ‘consciousness’, O.10.494, that is needed for ‘thinking’, <em>pepnûsthai</em>, even in Hādēs. Here I translate <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ as ‘consciousness’, referring to the mystical force that will reintegrate the consciousness of the self with the body after death. It is relevant that the <em>nóos</em> or ‘consciousness’ of the ‘spirit’ or <em>psūkhē</em> of the seer Teiresias is properly activated only after he drinks the blood of two sacrificial sheep that Odysseus slaughters in order to make mental contact, as we will see at O.11.095–098. I offer further analysis in H24H 11§35. But there is a complication that I did not note in that analysis: Circe instructs Odysseus to perform a libation for the dead when he is in Hādēs, O.10.516–520, and he is further instructed to promise in a prayer directed at these dead that he will perform a sacrifice for them if he succeeds in getting back home to Ithaca: there Odysseus will slaughter a barren cow for the dead in general, O.10.522–523, and a black ram for Teiresias in particular, O.10.524–525. When the right time comes in Hādēs, and Odysseus performs his libations for the dead, O11.024–028, he will follow through and make that promise to them, namely, that he will sacrifice in Ithaca a barren cow for the dead in general, O.11.029–030, and a black ram for Teiresias in particular, O.11.032–033. (At H24H 11§35, I leave it unsaid that this black ram to be sacrificed in Ithaca is different from the black ram and black ewe that Odysseus sacrifices in Hādēs: see the comment on O.10.521–537.) As we know from external sources, such as Pausanias 5.13.1-2, a black ram is the preferred sacrificial animal to slaughter for the purpose of making mental contact with a male cult hero (H24H 0§11).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.490-10.495","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"phrenes ‘heart, thinking’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"teleîn ‘reach an outcome; bring to fulfillment (in active forms of the verb)’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē 'spirit'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.218374","title":"Odyssey 10.493","body":"<p>The description of Teiresias as a <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’ is relevant to his prophecy about a future for Odysseus that transcends the boundaries of the narrative that frames the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.493","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mantis 'seer'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.218420","title":"Odyssey 10.494-10.495","body":"<p>analysis of Teiresias’ retention of nóos as the distinguishing characteristic which separates him from the dead</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:10.494-10.495","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.219410","title":"Odyssey 10.508-10.512","body":"<p>For Odysseus to make his transition from the realm of the living to the realm of the dead, he must first sail his ship to the end of the sea, delimited by the cosmic river Ōkeanos, and then he must sail on by somehow crossing this river, and the verb that I translate here as ‘cross’ is <em>perainein</em>, O.10.508.
