The goddess seduces the god, and the setting for their divine sexual encounter is the spectacular landscape of Mount Ida, which is the private abode of the thundering almighty. During the tryst of the god and the goddess, the Achaeans regain the upper hand in the fighting. But this new momentum is soon headed for a downturn. The divine interruption, despite all its cosmic sexual energy, becomes retrospectively a mere interlude in the narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>—once the tryst is over and the Plan of Zeus resumes its relentless course of action. </p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Carracci_-_Jupiter_et_Junon.jpeg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Juno and Jupiter.

The headquarters are pictured as a massing of ships beached on the shores of the south end of the bay of the Hellespont, and this location has been reconstructed in the comments on I.08.220–227, I.11.005–016, and I.11.806–808. But there is now an added detail to be noted here at I.14.030–032: the ships had been beached with their sterns facing inland and their prows facing out toward the waters, so that the Wall of the Achaeans, built ten years after the original beaching of the ships, was made to be contiguous with the sterns of the ships lined up along the southern shores of the bay of the Hellespont. See also the comment at I.15.385. As for the other ships of the Achaeans, they had been beached along the shores of the rest of the U-shaped bay, as we read at I.14.033–036. See the comment on those verses. These other ships, then, are peripheral to the ships beached at the central shoreline of the bay, which are pictured as the headquarters of the Achaeans. And these headquarers, as noted in the comment on I.11.806–808, are called the <em>naustathmon</em> ‘ship-station’ by Strabo 13.1.31–32 C595 (quoted at HPC 153) and 13.1.36 C598 (quoted at HPC 154). Also, as noted in the comments on I.11.806–808, Homeric poetry pictures such a ‘station’ as a political and sacral centerpoint for the leaders of the Achaeans. See also the comments on I.08.220–227. It is this central station that becomes the political stage of Agamemnon when he stands on the beached ship of Odysseus and projects his voice of authority to all the Achaeans stationed at their ships, I.08.220–227. And it is this central station, we will see later in more detail, that becomes the prime target of the Trojan hero Hector when he succeeds in penetrating the Achaean Wall. Also in a later comment, there will be more to say about the sharing of this central space by two figures in particular, Agamemnon and Odysseus. The joint participation of these two Homeric heroes in the innermost political zone that is marked by this spatial centerpoint is homologous with their engagement in two epic quarrels involving Achilles as a political outsider: the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon in the <em>Iliad</em>, it can be argued, is linked with the quarrel between Achilles and Odysseus in the “micro-<em>Iliad</em>” at O.08.072–083, which is the First Song of Demodokos (BA 42–58).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.27-14.36","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"bay of the Hellespont"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"headquarters of the Achaeans"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"naustathmon ‘ship-station’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"micro-Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"First Song of Demodokos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sterns of the Achaean ships"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Scamander"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"klisiā ‘shelter’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hellespont"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eris  'strife'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.128752","title":"Iliad 14.61-14.62","body":"<p>example of Nestor as the symbol of nóos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.61-14.62","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.128802","title":"Iliad 14.61-14.62","body":"<p>analysis of the connection of Nestor with noos, he as its personification</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.61-14.62","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.128848","title":"Iliad 14.61-14.62","body":"<p>comparison of Nestor and Polydamas, the counselors on their respective sides, in terms of noos (in the context of interpreting them in terms of the twin myth)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.61-14.62","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.128917","title":"Iliad 14.070","body":"<p>Again, as at I.13.227, the fear is expressed that the invading Achaean warriors could die <em>nōnumnoi</em> ‘nameless’ at Troy.

The maker will be the divine artisan Hephaistos, son of Hērā, I.14.239–240. This throne made by the god will be <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’, and this imperishability will last <em>aiei</em> ‘forever’, I.14.238. Also, this throne will be <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’, I.14.239. (On the combination of <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ and <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’ in symbolizing the artificial continuum of immortality, see BA 179.) The Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adverb <em>aieí</em> ‘always’ here is comparable to the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adjective <em>viśvā́yur</em> ‘lasting for all ages’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7: the form viśvā́yur is the neuter of <em>viśvā́yus</em>-, agreeing with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’. (Full argumentation in GMP 123–126 for interpreting <em>viśvā́yur</em> as a neuter and not masculine adjective in this context: it goes with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ and not, as some have argued, with the name of the god Indra.) The element <em>ā́yus-</em> in this Indic form is cognate with Greek <em>aiṓn</em> ‘life-force, lifetime’, the original locative singular of which became the adverb <em>aieí</em>, meaning ‘forever’. See the note on I.01.052. The formulaic combination <em>áphthiton aieí</em> is attested elsewhere as well in Homeric diction, at I.02.046 and at I.02.186. And there is even an instance of the combination <em>kléos áphthiton aieí</em> ‘a glory that is imperishable forever’ in an archaic piece of poetry inscribed in the seventh century BCE: κλεFος απθιτον αιFει, DGE no. 316. This combination brings us back to the wording κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται = <em>kléos áphthiton éstai</em> ‘there will be an imperishable glory’ at I.09.413. To be noted again is the parallelism between the Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ at I.09.413 and the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7 (full argumentation in GMP 123–126).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.238-14.240","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aphthito- ‘imperishable; unwilting’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.129731","title":"Iliad 14.245-14.246","body":"<p>analysis of the theme of Okeanos in Crates’ edition of Homer, its difference from Aristarchus’ edition, and how the passage appears in modern editions</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.245-14.246","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"plus verse\""},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aristarchus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Crates"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ōkeanos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.129777","title":"Iliad 14.246","body":"<p>the Homerus Auctus as not an editorial conflation of incompatible texts but as a preedited corpus of undifferentiated oral traditions that later became differentiated into distinct textual traditions</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.246","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.129826","title":"Iliad 14.270–280","body":"<p>Gods can take an irrevocable oath in the form of swearing by the waters of the underworld river Styx, which is what the goddess Hērā is asked to perform here at I.14.271–276 and which she actually does perform at I.14.277–280.

Right now, while Zeus is asleep after having made love to Hērā, the temporary intervention of Poseidon on the side of the Achaeans results in a compressed sequence of clipped narratives featuring only a few personal victories for only a few Achaean heroes. At I.14.509–510, the Master Narrator is asking the Muses: which one of the Achaeans has the first of these personal victories? The answer comes right away at I.14.511: Ajax son of Telamon is the first. What follows at I.14.511–512 is a most abbreviated narrative about this personal victory of Ajax, and what follows after that is a string of comparably abbreviated narratives about further personal victories achieved by five other Achaeans, I.14.513–522. Then, once these abbreviated narratives are completed, <em>Iliad</em> 14 comes to a hasty end. As soon as <em>Iliad</em> 15 begins, Zeus will be waking up, I.15.004–005. But before the god awakens, we see within the abbreviated space of I.14.513-522 a series of five more Achaeans achieving their own personal victories. Their victories, together with the initial victory of Ajax, are narrated at a pace that is noticeably hurried. There is no time to lose, and that is because, as already noted, Zeus will soon be waking up, I.15.004–005. Once the god does awaken, the momemtum will belong once again to the Trojans. So, the Achaeans benefit here only from a temporary upswing, which will soon be followed by another downswing.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.508","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"ennepein 'narrate, tell'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"re-invocation of Muse(s)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Mousa 'Muse'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"singing as narrating"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.131477","title":"Iliad 14.246a","body":"<p>Crates’ interpretation of the verse and evidence for a cosmic theory, contrasted with Aristarchus’ [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:14.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.131522","title":"Iliad 14.221a","body":"<p>notes on the sporadic instances where the editorial judgments of a critic named “Demetirus” is recorded.
