But the clamor of the Trojan ranks was as that of many thousand ewes\n    that stand waiting to be milked in the yards of some rich flockmaster, and\n    bleat incessantly in answer to the bleating of their lambs; for they had not\n    one speech nor language, but their tongues were diverse, and they came from\n    many different places. These were inspired of Ares, but the others by Athena -\n    and with them came Panic, Rout, and Strife whose fury never tires, sister and\n    friend of murderous Ares, who, from being at first but low in stature, grows\n    till she uprears her head to heaven, though her feet are still on earth. She it\n    was that went about among them and flung down discord to the waxing of sorrow\n    with even hand between them. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"446"},{"n":"446","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"446\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>When they were got together in one place shield\n    clashed with shield and spear with spear in the rage of battle. The bossed\n    shields beat one upon another, and there was a tramp as of a great multitude -\n    death-cry and shout of triumph of slain and slayers, and the earth ran red with\n    blood. As torrents swollen with rain course madly down their deep channels till\n    the angry floods meet in some gorge, and the shepherd the hillside hears their\n    roaring from afar - even such was the toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>]\n    and uproar of the hosts as they joined in battle. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"457\" unit=\"line\"/>First Antilokhos slew an armed warrior of the\n    Trojans, Ekhepolos, son of Thalysios, fighting in the foremost ranks. He struck\n    at the projecting part of his helmet and drove the spear into his brow; the\n    point of bronze pierced the bone, and darkness veiled his eyes; headlong as a\n    tower he fell amid the press of the fight, and as he dropped King Elephenor,\n    son of Khalkodon and leader of the proud Abantes began dragging him out of\n    reach of the darts that were falling around him, in haste to strip him of his\n    armor. But his purpose was not for long; Agenor saw him haling the body away,\n    and smote him in the side with his bronze-shod spear - for as he stooped his\n    side was left unprotected by his shield - and thus he perished. Then the fight\n    between Trojans and Achaeans grew furious over his body, and they flew upon\n    each other like wolves, man and man crushing one upon the other. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"473\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith Ajax, son of Telamon, slew the fair\n    youth Simoeisios, son of Anthemion, whom his mother bore by the banks of the\n    Simoeis, as she was coming down from <placeName key=\"tgn,1105013\">Mount\n    Ida</placeName>, where she had been with her parents to see their flocks.\n    Therefore he was named Simoeisios, but he did not live to pay his parents for\n    his rearing, for he was cut off untimely by the spear of mighty Ajax, who\n    struck him in the breast by the right nipple as he was coming on among the\n    foremost fighters; </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"481\" unit=\"line\"/>the spear went right through his shoulder, and\n    he fell as a poplar that has grown straight and tall in a meadow by some mere,\n    and its top is thick with branches. Then the wheelwright lays his axe to its\n    roots that he may fashion a felloe for the wheel of some goodly chariot, and it\n    lies seasoning by the waterside. In such wise did Ajax fell to earth\n    Simoeisios, son of Anthemion. Thereon Antiphos of the gleaming corselet, son of\n    Priam, hurled a spear at Ajax from amid the crowd and missed him, but he hit\n    Leukos, the brave comrade of Odysseus, in the groin, as he was dragging the\n    body of Simoeisios over to the other side; so he fell upon the body and loosed\n    his hold upon it. Odysseus was furious when he saw Leukos slain, and strode in\n    full armor through the front ranks till he was quite close; then he glared\n    round about him and took aim, and the Trojans fell back as he did so. His dart\n    was not sped in vain, for it struck Demokoön, the bastard son of Priam, who had\n    come to him from <placeName key=\"tgn,6000031\">Abydos</placeName>, where he had\n    charge of his father's mares. Odysseus, infuriated by the death of his comrade,\n    hit him with his spear on one temple, and the bronze point came through on the\n    other side of his forehead. Thereon darkness veiled his eyes, and his armor\n    rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Hektor, and they that\n    were in front, then gave round while the Argives raised a shout and drew off\n    the dead, pressing further forward as they did so. But Apollo looked down from\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7016140\">Pergamos</placeName> and called aloud to the\n    Trojans, for he was displeased. \"Trojans,\" he cried, \"rush on the foe, and do\n    not let yourselves be thus beaten by the Argives. Their skins are not stone nor\n    iron that when hit them you do them no harm. Moreover, Achilles, the son of\n    lovely Thetis, is not fighting, but is nursing his anger at the ships.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"514\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus spoke the mighty god, crying to them from\n    the city, while Zeus' redoubtable daughter, the Trito-born, went about among\n    the host of the Achaeans, and urged them forward whenever she beheld them\n    slackening. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"517\" unit=\"line\"/>Then fate fell upon Diores, son of Amarynkeus,\n    for he was struck by a jagged stone near the ankle of his right leg. He that\n    hurled it was Peirous, son of Imbrasos, leader of the Thracians, who had come\n    from <placeName key=\"perseus,Ainos\">Ainos</placeName>; the bones and both the\n    tendons were crushed by the pitiless stone. He fell to the ground on his back,\n    and in his death throes stretched out his hands towards his comrades. But\n    Peirous, who had wounded him, sprang on him and thrust a spear into his belly,\n    so that his bowels came gushing out upon the ground, and darkness veiled his\n    eyes. As he was leaving the body, Thoas of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002678\">Aetolia</placeName> struck him in the chest near the nipple, and the point\n    fixed itself in his lungs. Thoas came close up to him, pulled the spear out of\n    his chest, and then drawing his sword, smote him in the middle of the belly so\n    that he died; but he did not strip him of his armor, for his Thracian comrades,\n    men who wear their hair in a tuft at the top of their heads, stood round the\n    body and kept him off with their long spears for all his great stature and\n    valor; so he was driven back. Thus the two corpses lay stretched on earth near\n    to one another, the one leader of the Thracians and the other of the Epeans;\n    and many another fell round them. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"539\" unit=\"line\"/>And now no man would have made light of the\n    fighting if he could have gone about among it scatheless and unwounded, with\n    Athena leading him by the hand, and protecting him from the storm of spears and\n    arrows. For many Trojans and Achaeans on that day lay stretched side by side\n    face downwards upon the earth.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
