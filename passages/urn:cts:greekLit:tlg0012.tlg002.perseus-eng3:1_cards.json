Among them the father of gods and men was first to speak, for in his heart he thought of noble Aegisthus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>whom far-famed Orestes, Agamemnon's son, had slain. Thinking on him he spoke among the immortals, and said:\n    “Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods.

In her hand she held the spear of bronze,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>and she was in the likeness of a stranger, Mentes, the leader of the Taphians. There she found the proud wooers.

As he thought of these things, sitting among the wooers, he beheld Athena, and he went straight to the outer door; for in his heart he counted it shame<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"120\" unit=\"line\"/>that a stranger should stand long at the gates. So, drawing near, he clasped her right hand, and took from her the spear of bronze; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note>\n    “Hail, stranger; in our house thou shalt find entertainment and then, when thou hast tasted food, thou shalt tell of what thou hast need.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"125"},{"n":"125","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"125\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying, he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed.

Nor did he wait to be known; and yet he seemed no base man to look upon.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus, surely my father's home-coming is lost and gone. No longer do I put trust in tidings, whencesoever they may come,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>nor reck I of any prophecy which my mother haply may learn of a seer, when she has called him to the hall. But this stranger is a friend of my father's house from Taphos.
