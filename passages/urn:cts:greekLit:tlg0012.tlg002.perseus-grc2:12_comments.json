As Odysseus now returns from Hādēs, crossing again the circular cosmic stream of Ōkeanos at O.12.001–002 and coming back to his point of departure, that is, to the island of the goddess Circe at O.12.003, we find that this island is no longer in the Far West: instead, it is now in the Far East, where Hēlios the god of the sun has his ‘sunrises’, <em>an(a)tolai</em>, O.12.004, and where Ēōs the goddess of the dawn has her own palace, featuring a special space for her ‘choral singing-and-dancing’, <em>khoroi</em>, O.12.003–004. Before the hero’s descent into the realm of darkness and death, we saw the Ōkeanos as the absolute marker of the Far West; after his ascent into the realm of light and life, we see it as the absolute marker of the Far East (GM 237). <em>In returning to the island of Circe by crossing the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos for the second time, the hero has come full circle, experiencing sunrise after having experienced sunset</em>. Even the name of Circe may be relevant, since the form <em>Kirkē</em> may be cognate with the form <em>kirkos</em>, a variant of the noun <em>krikos</em>, meaning ‘circle, ring’ (DELG under κρίκος). As we will now see, this experience of coming full circle is a mental experience—or, to put it another way, it is a psychic experience.</p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The return of Odysseus to light and life replicates the mystical journey of the sun as it travels every night from the Far West to the Far East, and thus the hero’s return becomes a substitute for the mystical journey of a soul. This way, the <em>nostos</em> ‘return’ of Odysseus, as an epic narrative, becomes interwoven with a mystical subnarrative. While the epic narrative tells about the hero’s return to Ithaca after all the fighting at Troy and all the travels at sea, the mystical subnarrative tells about the soul’s return from darkness and death to light and life. </p><p>Part 3. </p><p>In some poetic traditions, the mystical subnarrative of the hero’s <em>nostos</em> can even be foregrounded, as in these verses of Theognis (1123–1128):</p><p>|1123 μή με κακῶν μίμνησκε· πέπονθά τοι οἷά τ’ Ὀδυσσεύς, |1124 ὅστ’ Ἀίδεω μέγα δῶμ’ ἤλυθεν ἐξαναδύς, |1125 ὃς δὴ καὶ μνηστῆρας ἀνείλατο νηλέι θυμῷ, |1126 Πηνελόπης εὔφρων κουριδίης ἀλόχου, |1127 ἥ μιν δήθ’ ὑπέμεινε φίλῳ παρὰ παιδὶ μένουσα, |1128 ὄφρα τε γῆς ἐπέβη δείλ’ ἁλίους τε μυχούς.</p><p>|1123 Do not remind me of my misfortunes! The kinds of things that happened to Odysseus have happened to me too. |1124 He came back, emerging from the great palace of Hādēs, |1125 and then killed the suitors with a pitiless heart [<em>thūmos</em>], |1126 while thinking good thoughts about his duly wedded wife Penelope, |1127 who all along waited for him and stood by their dear son |1128 while he [= Odysseus] was experiencing dangers on land and in the gaping chasms of the sea.</p><p>Part 4.</p><p>The return of Odysseus from Hādēs leads to a rebuilding of his heroic identity. Earlier in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the status of Odysseus as a hero of epic had already been reduced to nothing. As we saw in the tale of his encounter with the Cyclops, the return of Odysseus from the monster’s cave deprives him of his past identity at Troy. His epic fame can no longer depend on his power of <em>mētis</em>, ‘craft’, which had led to the invention of the Wooden Horse, which in turn had led to the destruction of Troy. After his encounter with the Cyclops, Odysseus must achieve a new epic identity as the hero of his own epic about homecoming, about his own <em>nostos</em>, but, for the moment, his confidence in his power to bring about this <em>nostos</em> is reduced to nothing. He has lost his confidence in the power of his own <em>mētis</em>, ‘craftiness’, to devise a stratagem for achieving a <em>nostos</em>. When he reaches the island of Circe and learns that this place, though it first seems familiar and reminiscent of his own island, is in fact strange and alien and antithetical to home, he despairs, as we saw at O.10.189-202.</p><p>Part 5.</p><p>Despite such moments of disorientation for Odysseus, his <em>nóos</em>, ‘thinking’, will ultimately reorient him, steering him away from his Iliadic past and toward his ultimate Odyssean future. That is, the hero’s <em>nóos</em> will makes it possible for him to achieve a <em>nostos</em>, which is not only his ‘homecoming’ but also the ‘song about a homecoming’ that is the <em>Odyssey</em>. For this song to succeed, Odysseus must keep adapting his identity by making his <em>nóos</em> fit the <em>nóos</em> of the many different characters he encounters in the course of his <em>nostos</em> in progress. In order to adapt, he must master many different forms of discourse. The epithet for this ability to adapt, as we will see, is <em>poluainos</em>, ‘having many different kinds of coded message’: that is how, as we will see, Odysseus is described by the Sirens when he sails past their island, O.12.184).</p><p>[[GN 2017.06.15 via BA 206, GMP 237, PH 236–237.]]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:12.1-12.4","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aiaia"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"coincidence of opposites"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Circe"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Circe"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"speaking name\" (nomen loquens)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ōkeanos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"khoros 'place for choral singing/ dancing'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.225120","title":"Odyssey 12.014-12.015","body":"<p>|14 τύμβον χεύαντες καὶ ἐπὶ στήλην ἐρύσαντες |15 πήξαμεν ἀκροτάτῳ τύμβῳ εὐῆρες ἐρετμόν.</p><p>|14 We heaped up a tomb [<em>tumbos</em>] for him, and then, erecting as a column on top, |15 we stuck his well-made oar into the very top of the tomb [<em>tumbos</em>]. </p><p>The story of Elpenor’s death was told at O.10.551–560. In the comment on those verses, I already noted that the relevance of this figure to the homecoming of Odysseus is signaled at O.11.051–083, and, further, here at O.12.014–015. Here we see Odysseus and his men making for Elpenor a tomb by heaping a tumulus of earth over the seafarer’s corpse and then, instead of erecting a <em>stēlē</em> or vertical ‘column’ on top, they stick his oar into the heap of earth. (What follows is epitomized from H24H §§47–50.) </p><p>  </p><p>Part 1.</p><p>The ritual procedure for making the tomb of Elpenor follows the instructions given to Odysseus during his sojourn in Hādēs, O.11.051-080; these instructions were given by Elpenor himself or, more accurately, by his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’, O.11.051, and the wording makes it explicit that the tomb to be made is a <em>sēma</em>, O.11.075.</p><p>  </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>In the light of this description, we can see that the ritual act of Odysseus when he sticks his own well-made oar into the ground at O.11.129 and sacrifices to Poseidon at O.11.130-131 points to the making of his own <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’, corresponding to the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given to him by Teiresias at O.11.126).</p><p>  </p><p>Part 3.</p><p>There are two meanings to be found in this ritual act of Odysseus, since he sticks his oar into the ground at the precise moment when the oar is no longer recognized as an oar, O.11.129. In this <em>coincidence of opposites</em>, the oar is now a winnowing shovel, O.11.128—an agricultural implement that is used for separating the grain from the chaff after the harvesting of wheat. You toss the harvested wheat up in the air, and even the slightest breeze will blow the chaff further to the side while the grain falls more or less straight down into a heap in front of you. The winnowing shovel looks exactly like an oar, but it is not an oar for agriculturists. Conversely, the oar looks exactly like the winnowing shovel, but it is not a winnowing shovel for seafarers. For Odysseus, however, this implement could be both an oar and a winnowing shovel, since he could see that the same <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ has two distinct meanings in two distinct places: what is an oar for the seafarers is a winnowing shovel for the inlanders. And, in order to recognize that one <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ could have two meanings, <em>Odysseus must travel</em>, as we see from the key wording he learned from the instructions of Teiresias. Odysseus himself uses this key wording when he retells to Penelope a retrospective story of his travels, O.23.266–268. And, as we saw at O.01.003, the travels of Odysseus throughout ‘the many cities of mortals’ were the key to his achieving his special kind of heroic consciousness, or <em>nóos</em>.</p><p>  </p><p>Part 4.</p><p>Just as the implement carried by Odysseus is one sign with two meanings, so also the picture of this implement that we see stuck into the ground is one sign with two meanings. We have already noted the first of these meanings, namely, that the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by Teiresias to Odysseus at O.11.126 is in fact the tomb of Odysseus, imagined as a heap of earth with an oar stuck into it on top, just as the tomb of the seafarer Elpenor is a heap of earth with his own oar stuck into it on top, as we just saw at O.12.14-15 and at O.11.075–078 respectively); in fact, as we saw O.11.075, this heap of earth is actually called the <em>sēma</em> of Elpenor, and the word here clearly means ‘tomb’. </p><p>  </p><p>Part 5.</p><p>Accordingly, I paraphrase the first of the two meanings as a headline, “the seafarer is dead.” As for the second of the two meanings, I propose to paraphrase it as another headline, “the harvest is complete.” Here is why: the act of sticking the shaft of a winnowing shovel, with the blade pointing upward, into a heap of harvested wheat after having winnowed away the chaff from the grain is a ritual gesture indicating that the winnower’s work is complete (as we see from the wording of Theocritus 7.155-156). And the act of sticking the shaft of an oar into the ground, again with the blade facing upward, is a ritual gesture indicating that the oarsman’s work is likewise complete—as in the case of Odysseus’ dead comrade Elpenor, whose tomb is to be a heap of earth with the shaft of his oar stuck into the top, as we see at O.11.075–078 and here at O.12.014–015. So also with Odysseus: he too will never again have to sail the seas. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:12.14-12.15","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Elpenor"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"coincidence of opposites"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"the tomb of Odysseus revisited"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.225165","title":"Odyssey 12.21-12.22","body":"<p>analysis of Circe’s emphatic connection of Nekyia with theme of a “return from death”</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:12.21-12.22","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.225218","title":"Odyssey 12.021-022","body":"<p>|21 σχέτλιοι, οἳ ζώοντες ὑπήλθετε δῶμ’ Ἀΐδαο, |22 δισθανέες, ὅτε τ’ ἄλλοι ἅπαξ θνῄσκουσ’ ἄνθρωποι.</p><p>|21 Wretched men!

That is why Circe, after Odysseus and his men arrive back on her island, addresses the whole group as <em>dis-thanees</em>, that is, ‘those who experience death twice’. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 11§61.) So, Odysseus together with his companions had died metaphorically when he went to Hādēs in <em>Odyssey</em> 11 and then he had returned to light and life in <em>Odyssey</em> 12.

Homeric poetry is here telling a story by channeling Odysseus in the act of telling his own story, and the act of universalizing is immediately expressed. It happens at O.12.070 here: the wording says right away that the ship Argo, ‘which-is-on-the-minds-of’ (μέλουσα) humans, is an all-important subject, since it is on the minds of ‘all’ (πᾶσι) humans in the universe. The sailors of the good ship Argo faced the challenge of sailing past a most dangerous rock in the treacherous seas, and now Odysseus, admirer of the Argonauts, is faced with the same challenge in his own story. The verb <em>melein</em> ‘be on one’s mind’ is used here in the sense of referring to a song that is on the minds of all who hear it or want to hear it.

Also comparable is what the Narrator says to the Muses at I.02.485: <em>iste te panta</em> ‘you know everything’. By knowing everything about the Trojan War, the Sirens are like the Muses of the <em>Iliad</em>, as at I.02.485. It may be said that the Sirens are the false Muses of the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The Song of the Sirens is relevant to I.09.413, where Achilles says he will have to choose between a <em>nostos</em>, which is a safe ‘homecoming’, and the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of the poetry that will be his if he dies young at Troy. See the comment on I.09.410–416. Achilles will have to forfeit <em>nostos</em> in order to achieve his <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ as the central hero of the <em>Iliad</em>. By contrast, Odysseus must have both <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in order to merit his own heroic status in the <em>Odyssey</em> (BA 36-40). For him, the <em>nostos</em> is not only a ‘homecoming’ but also a ‘song about a homecoming’, and that song is the <em>Odyssey</em>. It is the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of that song that will be his—if his quest for a homecoming is to succeed. </p><p>Part 3. </p><p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 9§14.) The narrative of the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of song that Odysseus earns in the <em>Odyssey</em> cannot be the <em>Iliad</em>, which means ‘tale of Troy’ (Ilion is the other name for Troy). The <em>Iliad</em> establishes Achilles as the central hero of the story of Troy, even though he failed to destroy the city—while Odysseus succeeded, by devising the stratagem of the Wooden Horse. Because of the <em>Iliad</em> tradition, “the <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus at Troy was preempted by the <em>kleos</em> of Achilles” (BA 41). Thus the <em>kleos</em> that Odysseus should get for his success in destroying Troy is elusive, by contrast with the <em>kleos</em> that Achilles gets in the <em>Iliad</em>, which is permanent. So, Odysseus cannot afford to dwell on his success at Troy, because the <em>kleos</em> he may get for that success will become permanent only if it extends into the <em>kleos</em> that he gets for achieving a successful homecoming. Odysseus, then, must get over the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p>Part 4.</p><p>As we see from the wording of the Sirens’ Song here in the <em>Odyssey</em>, O.12.184–191, the sheer pleasure of listening to a song about the destruction of Troy will be in vain if there is no <em>nostos</em>, no safe return home from the faraway world of epic heroes; and, by extension, the <em>Iliad</em> itself will become a Song of the Sirens without a successful narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> (BA [1999] xii).</p><p>Part 5.</p><p>(What follows in Parts 5 and 6 is epitomized from H24H 10§§19–20.) So, to repeat, Odysseus must get over the <em>Iliad</em>. But, to get over the <em>Iliad</em>, he must sail past it. His ongoing story, which is the <em>Odyssey</em>, must be about the seafarer who is making his way back home, not about the warrior who once fought at Troy. The <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus at Troy cannot be the master myth of the <em>Odyssey</em>, since the <em>kleos</em> of Achilles at Troy has already become the master myth of the <em>Iliad</em>. As I already noted, the <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ of Achilles in the Iliad has preempted a <em>kleos</em> for Odysseus that centers on this rival hero’s glorious exploits at Troy. For the hero of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the ongoing <em>kleos</em> of his adventures in the course of his <em>nostos</em> is actually threatened by any past <em>kleos</em> of his adventures back at Troy. Such a <em>kleos</em> of the past in the <em>Odyssey</em> could not rival the <em>kleos</em> of the more distant past in the <em>Iliad</em>. It would be a false <em>Iliad</em>. That is why Odysseus must sail past the Island of the Sirens. The Sirens, as false Muses, tempt the hero by offering to sing for him an endless variety of songs about Troy in particular and about everything else in general. </p><p>Part 6.</p><p>The sheer pleasure of listening to the songs of the Sirens threatens not only the <em>nostos</em>, ‘homecoming’, of Odysseus, who is tempted to linger and never stop listening to the endless stories about Troy, but also the soundness of his ‘thinking’, his <em>nóos</em>. And it even threatens the ongoing song about the hero’s homecoming, that is, the <em>Odyssey</em> itself (BA [1999] xii). Accordingly, the use of the verb <em>néesthai</em> ‘return, have a homecoming’ at O.12.188 signals what is at stake for both the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ and the <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ of Odysseus, and it is no accident that these two nouns are actually both derived from that verb. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:12.184-12.191","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Song of the Sirens"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.225920","title":"Odyssey 12.184","body":"<p>The translations ‘of many fables’ or more simply ‘fabled’ reflect the specialized meaning of <em>ainos</em> as ‘fable’. In addressing Odysseus this way, the Sirens are recognizing the hero’s fame as a master of <em>ainos</em>, which is a form of speech that can more generally be described as a <em>coded message</em> (on which see the comment on I.09.524–599). So, Odysseus is recognized as ‘able to speak about many things <em>in code</em>’. Such coded speech is by nature ‘riddling’, as we see from the meaning of <em>ainigma</em> ‘enigma, riddle’, which is a derivative of <em>ainos</em>. In order to survive, Odysseus must master many different forms of discourse, many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>. That is why he is addressed as <em>poluainos</em> ‘having many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>’ by the Sirens here when he sails past their island, O.12.184. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 10§43.) Even the transparent meaning of Polyphemus, <em>Poluphēmos</em>, which is the name of the Cyclops blinded by Odysseus, foretells the hero’s mastery of the <em>ainos</em>. As an adjective, <em>poluphēmos</em> means ‘having many different kinds of things said’, derived from the noun <em>phēmē</em>, ‘thing said’, as at O.20.100 and at O.20.105. See the comment at O.20.098-121, [HR]3§23. This adjective <em>poluphēmos</em> ‘having many different kinds of things said’ is applied as an epithet to the singer <em>Phēmios</em>, O.22.376, portrayed as singing songs that have many different meanings: see the comments at O.01.342 and O.02.035 (see also BA 17). In the case of Polyphemus, the very meaning of his name, which conveys the opposite of the meaning conveyed by the false name of Odysseus, <em>Outis</em>, ‘no one’, foretells the verbal mastery of the hero who blinded the monster.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:12.184","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"poluainos ‘of many riddling words, of many fables; fabled’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Polyphemus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ainos 'coded words; fable'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.225967","title":"Odyssey 12.211-12.212","body":"<p>analysis of the relation between escape and intelligence.
