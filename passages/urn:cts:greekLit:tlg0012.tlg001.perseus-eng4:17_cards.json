[{"n":"1","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"1\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"1\" unit=\"line\"/>Brave Menelaos son of Atreus now came to know\n    that Patroklos had fallen, and made his way through the front ranks clad in\n    full armor to bestride him. As a cow stands lowing over her first calf, even so\n    did yellow-haired Menelaos bestride Patroklos. He held his round shield and his\n    spear in front of him, resolute to kill any who should dare face him. But the\n    son of Panthoos had also noted the body, and came up to Menelaos saying,\n    \"Menelaos, son of Atreus, draw back, leave the body, and let the bloodstained\n    spoils be. I was first of the Trojans and their brave allies to drive my spear\n    into Patroklos, let me, therefore, have my full glory [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] among the Trojans, or I will take aim and kill you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"18\" unit=\"line\"/>To this Menelaos answered in great anger \"By\n    father Zeus, boasting is an ill thing. The pard is not more bold, nor the lion\n    nor savage wild-boar, which is fiercest and most dauntless of all creatures,\n    than are the proud sons of Panthoos. Yet Hyperenor did not see out the days of\n    his youth when he made light of me and withstood me, deeming me the meanest\n    warrior among the Danaans. His own feet never bore him back to gladden his wife\n    and parents. Even so shall I make an end of you too, if you withstand me; get\n    you back into the crowd and do not face me, or it shall be worse for you. Even\n    a fool may be wise after the event.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"34\" unit=\"line\"/>Euphorbos would not listen, and said, \"Now\n    indeed, Menelaos, shall you pay for the death of my brother over whom you\n    vaunted, and whose wife you widowed in her bridal chamber, while you brought\n    grief [penthos] unspeakable on his parents. I shall comfort these poor people\n    if I bring your head and armor and place them in the hands of Panthoos and\n    noble Phrontis.

The point went clean\n    through his neck, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to\n    the ground. His locks of hair, so deftly bound in bands of silver and gold,\n    were all bedrabbled with flecks of blood, which looked like myrtle-blossoms\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharites</term>]. As one who has grown a fine young\n    olive tree in a clear space where there is abundance of water - the plant is\n    full of promise, and though the winds beat upon it from every quarter it puts\n    forth its white blossoms till the blasts of some fierce wind sweep down upon it\n    and level it with the ground - even so did Menelaos strip the fair youth\n    Euphorbos of his armor after he had slain him. Or as some fierce lion upon the\n    mountains in the pride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd\n    as it is feeding - first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws, and then\n    gorges on her blood and entrails; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry\n    against him, but they stand aloof and will not come close to him, for they are\n    pale with fear - even so no one had the courage to face valiant Menelaos. The\n    son of Atreus would have then carried off the armor of the son of Panthoos with\n    ease, had not Phoebus Apollo been angry, and in the guise of Mentes chief of\n    the Kikones incited Hektor to attack him. \"Hektor,\" said he, \"you are now going\n    after the horses of the noble son of Aiakos, but you will not take them; they\n    cannot be kept in hand and driven by mortal man, save only by Achilles, who is\n    son to an immortal mother. Meanwhile Menelaos son of Atreus has bestridden the\n    body of Patroklos and killed the noblest of the Trojans, Euphorbos son of\n    Panthoos, so that he can fight no more.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"82\" unit=\"line\"/>The god then went back into the toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and turmoil, but the soul of Hektor was\n    darkened with a cloud of grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>]; he looked\n    along the ranks and saw Euphorbos lying on the ground with the blood still\n    flowing from his wound, and Menelaos stripping him of his armor. On this he\n    made his way to the front like a flame of fire, clad in his gleaming armor, and\n    crying with a loud voice. When the son of Atreus heard him, he said to himself\n    in his dismay, \"Alas! what shall I do? I may not let the Trojans take the armor\n    of Patroklos who has fallen fighting on my behalf, lest some Danaan who sees me\n    should cry shame upon me. Still if for the sake of my honor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">timê</term>] I fight Hektor and the Trojans single-handed,\n    they will prove too many for me, for Hektor is bringing them up in force. Why,\n    however, should I thus hesitate? When a man, opposing the will of a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term>, fights with one whom a god befriends, he will\n    soon rue it. Let no Danaan think ill of me if I give place to Hektor, for the\n    hand of heaven gives him honor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">timê</term>]. Yet, if I\n    could find Ajax, the two of us would fight Hektor and any <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> too, if we might only save the body of Patroklos for Achilles\n    son of Peleus. This, of many evils, would be the least.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"106\" unit=\"line\"/>While he was thus in two minds, the Trojans\n    came up to him with Hektor at their head; he therefore drew back and left the\n    body, turning about like some bearded lion who is being chased by dogs and men\n    from a stockyard with spears and hue and cry, whereon he is daunted and slinks\n    sulkily off - even so did Menelaos son of Atreus turn and leave the body of\n    Patroklos. When among the body of his men, he looked around for mighty Ajax son\n    of Telamon, and presently saw him on the extreme left of the fight, cheering on\n    his men and exhorting them to keep on fighting,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"118\" unit=\"line\"/>for Phoebus Apollo had spread a great panic\n    among them. He ran up to him and said, \"Ajax, my good friend, come with me at\n    once to dead Patroklos, if so be that we may take the body to Achilles - as for\n    his armor, Hektor already has it.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"122\" unit=\"line\"/>These words stirred the heart of Ajax, and he\n    made his way among the front ranks, Menelaos going with him. Hektor had\n    stripped Patroklos of his armor, and was dragging him away to cut off his head\n    and take the body to fling before the dogs of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>. But Ajax came up with his shield like wall before him, on\n    which Hektor withdrew under shelter of his men, and sprang on to his chariot,\n    giving the armor over to the Trojans to take to the city, as a great glory\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] for himself; Ajax, therefore, covered\n    the body of Patroklos with his broad shield and bestrode him; as a lion stands\n    over his whelps if hunters have come upon him in a forest when he is with his\n    little ones - in the pride and fierceness of his strength he draws his knit\n    brows down till they cover his eyes - even so did Ajax bestride the body of\n    Patroklos, and by his side stood Menelaos son of Atreus, nursing great sorrow\n    [penthos] in his heart. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"140"},{"n":"140","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"140\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Glaukos son of Hippolokhos looked fiercely\n    at Hektor and rebuked him sternly. \"Hektor,\" said he, \"you make a brave show,\n    but in fight you are sadly wanting.

I have held you so far as a man of more understanding\n    than any in all <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, but now I\n    despise you for saying that I am afraid of Ajax. I fear neither battle nor the\n    din of chariots, but Zeus' will [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] is stronger\n    than ours; Zeus at one time makes even a strong man draw back and snatches\n    victory from his grasp, while at another he will set him on to fight. Come\n    hither then, my friend, stand by me and see indeed whether I shall play the\n    coward the whole day through as you say, or whether I shall not stay some even\n    of the boldest Danaans from fighting round the body of Patroklos.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"183\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he called loudly on the Trojans\n    saying, \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, be men, my\n    friends, and fight might and main, while I put on the goodly armor of Achilles,\n    which I took when I killed Patroklos.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"188\" unit=\"line\"/>With this Hektor left the fight, and ran full\n    speed after his men who were taking the armor of Achilles to <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, but had not yet got far. Standing for a\n    while apart from the woeful fight, he changed his armor. His own he sent to the\n    strong city of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> and to the\n    Trojans, while he put on the immortal armor of the son of Peleus, which the\n    gods had given to Peleus, who in his age gave it to his son; but the son did\n    not grow old in his father's armor. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"198\" unit=\"line\"/>When Zeus, lord of the storm-cloud, saw Hektor\n    standing aloof and arming himself in the armor of the son of Peleus, he wagged\n    his head and muttered to himself saying, \"A! poor wretch, you arm in the armor\n    of a hero, before whom many another trembles, and you reck nothing of the doom\n    that is already close upon you.

With a shout he strode in among\n    the allies, and his armor flashed about him so that he seemed to all of them\n    like the great son of Peleus himself. He went about among them and cheered them\n    on - Mesthles, Glaukos, Medon, Thersilokhos, Asteropaios, Deisenor and\n    Hippothoos, Phorkys, Chromios, and Ennomos the augur. All these did he exhort\n    saying, \"Hear me, allies from other cities who are here in your thousands, it\n    was not in order to have a crowd about me that I called you hither each from\n    his several city, but that with heart and soul you might defend the wives and\n    little ones of the Trojans from the fierce Achaeans. For this do I oppress my\n    people with your food and the presents that make you rich. Therefore turn, and\n    charge at the foe, to stand or fall as is the game of war; whoever shall bring\n    Patroklos, dead though he be, into the hands of the Trojans, and shall make\n    Ajax give way before him, I will give him one half of the spoils while I keep\n    the other.

Next came\n    Idomeneus and Meriones his esquire, peer of murderous Ares. As for the others\n    that came into the fight after these, who of his own self could name them? </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"262\" unit=\"line\"/>The Trojans with Hektor at their head charged\n    in a body. As a great wave that comes thundering in at the mouth of some\n    heaven-born river, and the rocks that jut into the sea ring with the roar of\n    the breakers that beat and buffet them - even with such a roar did the Trojans\n    come on; but the Achaeans in singleness of heart stood firm about the son of\n    Menoitios, and fenced him with their bronze shields. Zeus, moreover, hid the\n    brightness of their helmets in a thick cloud, for he had borne no grudge\n    against the son of Menoitios while he was still alive and squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] to the descendant of Aiakos; therefore he\n    was loath to let him fall a prey to the dogs of his foes the Trojans, and urged\n    his comrades on to defend him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"274\" unit=\"line\"/>At first the Trojans drove the Achaeans back,\n    and they withdrew from the dead man daunted. The Trojans did not succeed in\n    killing any one, nevertheless they drew the body away. But the Achaeans did not\n    lose it long, for Ajax, foremost of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus\n    alike in stature and prowess,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"280\" unit=\"line\"/>quickly rallied them and made towards the front\n    like a wild boar upon the mountains when he stands at bay in the forest glades\n    and routs the hounds and lusty youths that have attacked him - even so did Ajax\n    son of Telamon passing easily in among the phalanxes of the Trojans, disperse\n    those who had bestridden Patroklos and were most bent on winning glory by\n    dragging him off to their city. At this moment Hippothoos brave son of the\n    Pelasgian Lethus, in his zeal for Hektor and the Trojans, was dragging the body\n    off by the foot through the press of the fight, having bound a strap round the\n    sinews near the ankle; but a mischief soon befell him from which none of those\n    could save him who would have gladly done so, for the son of Telamon sprang\n    forward and smote him on his bronze-cheeked helmet. The plumed headpiece broke\n    about the point of the weapon, struck at once by the spear and by the strong\n    hand of Ajax, so that the bloody brain came oozing out through the\n    crest-socket. His strength then failed him and he let Patroklos' foot drop from\n    his hand, as he fell full length dead upon the body; thus he died far from the\n    fertile land of Larissa, and never repaid his parents the cost of bringing him\n    up, for his life was cut short early by the spear of mighty Ajax. Hektor then\n    took aim at Ajax with a spear, but he saw it coming and just managed to avoid\n    it; the spear passed on and struck Schedios son of noble Iphitos, leader of the\n    Phoceans, who dwelt in famed Panopeus and reigned over many people; it struck\n    him under the middle of the collar-bone the bronze point went right through\n    him, coming out at the bottom of his shoulder-blade, and his armor rang\n    rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Ajax in his turn struck\n    noble Phorkys son of Phainops in the middle of the belly as he was bestriding\n    Hippothoos, and broke the plate of his cuirass; whereon the spear tore out his\n    entrails and he clutched the ground in his palm as he fell to earth. Hektor and\n    those who were in the front rank then gave ground, while the Argives raised a\n    loud cry of triumph, and drew off the bodies of Phorkys and Hippothoos which\n    they stripped presently of their armor. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"319\" unit=\"line\"/>The Trojans would now have been worsted by the\n    brave Achaeans and driven back to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> through their own cowardice, while the Argives, so great\n    was their courage and endurance, would have achieved a triumph even against the\n    will of Zeus, if Apollo had not roused Aeneas, in the likeness of Periphas son\n    of Epytos, an attendant who had grown old in the service of Aeneas' aged\n    father, and was at all times devoted to him. In his likeness, then, Apollo\n    said, \"Aeneas, can you not manage, even though heaven be against us, to save\n    high <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>?

Aeneas speared\n    Leiokritos son of Arisbas, a valiant follower of Lykomedes, and Lykomedes was\n    moved with pity as he saw him fall; he therefore went close up, and speared\n    Apisaon son of Hippasus shepherd of his people in the liver under the midriff,\n    so that he died; he had come from fertile Paeonia and was the best man of them\n    all after Asteropaios. Asteropaios flew forward to avenge him and attack the\n    Danaans, but this might no longer be,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"355\" unit=\"line\"/>inasmuch as those about Patroklos were well\n    covered by their shields, and held their spears in front of them, for Ajax had\n    given them strict orders that no man was either to give ground, or to stand out\n    before the others, but all were to hold well together about the body and fight\n    hand to hand. Thus did huge Ajax bid them, and the earth ran red with blood as\n    the corpses fell thick on one another alike on the side of the Trojans and\n    allies, and on that of the Danaans; for these last, too, fought no bloodless\n    fight though many fewer of them perished, through the care they took to defend\n    and stand by one another. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"366\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did they fight as it were a flaming fire;\n    it seemed as though it had gone hard even with the sun and moon, for they were\n    hidden over all that part where the bravest heroes were fighting about the dead\n    son of Menoitios, whereas the other Danaans and Achaeans fought at their ease\n    in full daylight with brilliant sunshine all round them, and there was not a\n    cloud to be seen neither on plain nor mountain. These last moreover would rest\n    for a while and leave off fighting, for they were some distance apart and\n    beyond the range of one another's weapons, whereas those who were in the thick\n    of the fray suffered both from battle and darkness. All the best of them were\n    being worn out by the great weight of their armor, but the two valiant heroes,\n    Thrasymedes and Antilokhos, had not yet heard of the death of Patroklos, and\n    believed him to be still alive and leading the van against the Trojans; they\n    were keeping themselves in reserve against the death or rout of their own\n    comrades, for so Nestor had ordered when he sent them from the ships into\n    battle. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"384\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus through the livelong day did they wage\n    fierce war, and the sweat of their toil rained ever on their legs under them,\n    and on their hands and eyes, as they fought over the squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of the fleet son of Peleus. It was as when a\n    man gives a great ox-hide all drenched in fat to his men, and bids them stretch\n    it; whereon they stand round it in a ring and tug till the moisture leaves it,\n    and the fat soaks in for the many that pull at it, and it is well stretched\n    -</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"393\" unit=\"line\"/>even so did the two sides tug the dead body\n    hither and thither within the compass of but a little space - the Trojans\n    steadfastly set on dragging it into <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, while the Achaeans were no less so on taking it to their\n    ships; and fierce was the fight between them.

He had no idea, therefore, that Patroklos was dead, and deemed\n    that he would return alive as soon as he had gone close up to the gates. He\n    knew that he was not to sack the city neither with nor without himself, for his\n    mother had often told him this when he had sat alone with her, and she had\n    informed him of the counsels of great Zeus.

Hot tears fell from their eyes as they mourned the loss of their\n    charioteer, and their noble manes drooped all wet from under the yokestraps on\n    either side the yoke. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"441\" unit=\"line\"/>The son of Kronos saw them and took pity upon\n    their sorrow.

Behind\n    them fought Automedon full of sorrow for his comrade, as a vulture amid a flock\n    of geese. In and out, and here and there, full speed he dashed amid the throng\n    of the Trojans, but for all the fury of his pursuit he killed no man, for he\n    could not wield his spear and keep his horses in hand when alone in the\n    chariot; at last, however, a comrade, Alkimedon, son of Laerkes son of Haimon\n    caught sight of him and came up behind his chariot. \"Automedon,\" said he, \"what\n    god has put this folly into your heart and robbed you of your right mind, that\n    you fight the Trojans in the front rank single-handed?

When Hektor saw\n    him he said to Aeneas who was near him, \"Aeneas, counselor of the mail-clad\n    Trojans, I see the steeds of the fleet son of Aiakos come into battle with weak\n    hands to drive them. I am sure, if you think well, that we might take them;\n    they will not dare face us if we both attack them.\" The valiant son of Anchises\n    was of the same mind, and the pair went right on, with their shoulders covered\n    under shields of tough dry ox-hide, overlaid with much bronze. Chromios and\n    Aretos went also with them, and their hearts beat high with hope that they\n    might kill the men and capture the horses - fools that they were, for they were\n    not to return scatheless from their meeting with Automedon, who prayed to\n    father Zeus and was forthwith filled with courage and strength abounding. He\n    turned to his trusty comrade Alkimedon and said, \"Alkimedon, keep your horses\n    so close up that I may feel their breath upon my back; I doubt that we shall\n    not stay Hektor son of Priam till he has killed us and mounted behind the\n    horses; he will then either spread panic among the ranks of the Achaeans, or\n    himself be killed among the foremost.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"507\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he cried out to the two Ajaxes and\n    Menelaos, \"Ajaxes leaders of the Argives, and Menelaos, give the dead body over\n    to them that are best able to defend it, and come to the rescue of us living;\n    for Hektor and Aeneas who are the two best men among the Trojans, are pressing\n    us hard in the full tide of war.

As when some sturdy youth, axe in hand, deals his blow\n    behind the horns of an ox and severs the tendons at the back of its neck so\n    that it springs forward and then drops, even so did Aretos give one bound and\n    then fall on his back the spear quivering in his body till it made an end of\n    him. Hektor then aimed a spear at Automedon but he saw it coming and stooped\n    forward to avoid it, so that it flew past him and the point stuck in the\n    ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Ares robbed it of its force.\n    They would then have fought hand to hand with swords had not the two Ajaxes\n    forced their way through the crowd when they heard their comrade calling, and\n    parted them for all their fury - for Hektor, Aeneas, and Chromios were afraid\n    and drew back, leaving Aretos to lie there struck to the heart. Automedon, peer\n    of fleet Ares, then stripped him of his armor and vaunted over him saying, \"I\n    have done little to assuage my sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] for\n    the son of Menoitios, for the man I have killed is not so good as he was.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he took the blood-stained spoils\n    and laid them upon his chariot; then he mounted the car with his hands and feet\n    all steeped in gore as a lion that has been gorging upon a bull. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"543"},{"n":"543","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"543\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"543\" unit=\"line\"/>And now the fierce groanful fight again raged\n    about Patroklos, for Athena came down from heaven and roused its fury by the\n    command of far-seeing Zeus, who had changed his mind [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] and sent her to encourage the Danaans.

Therefore she put strength into his knees and\n    shoulders, and made him as bold as a fly, which, though driven off will yet\n    come again and bite if it can, so dearly does it love man's blood- even so bold\n    as this did she make him as he stood over Patroklos and threw his spear. Now\n    there was among the Trojans a man named Podes, son of Eetion, who was both rich\n    and valiant. Hektor held him in the highest honor in the district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>], for he was his comrade and boon companion; the\n    spear of Menelaos struck this man in the belt just as he had turned in flight,\n    and went right through him. Whereon he fell heavily forward, and Menelaos son\n    of Atreus drew off his body from the Trojans into the ranks of his own people. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"582\" unit=\"line\"/>Apollo then went up to Hektor and spurred him\n    on to fight, in the likeness of Phainops son of Asios who lived in <placeName key=\"tgn,6000030\">Abydos</placeName> and was the most favored of all\n    Hektor's guests. In his likeness Apollo said, \"Hektor, who of the Achaeans will\n    fear you henceforward now that you have quailed before Menelaos who has ever\n    been rated poorly as a warrior? Yet he has now got a corpse away from the\n    Trojans single-handed, and has slain your own true comrade, a man brave among\n    the foremost, Podes son of Eetion. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"591\" unit=\"line\"/>A dark cloud of grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] fell upon Hektor as he heard, and he made his way to the\n    front clad in full armor. Thereon the son of Kronos seized his bright tasseled\n    aegis, and veiled Ida in cloud: he sent forth his lightnings and his thunders,\n    and as he shook his aegis he gave victory to the Trojans and routed the\n    Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"597\" unit=\"line\"/>The panic was begun by Peneleos the Boeotian,\n    for while keeping his face turned ever towards the foe he had been hit with a\n    spear on the upper part of the shoulder; a spear thrown by Polydamas had grazed\n    the top of the bone, for Polydamas had come up to him and struck him from close\n    at hand. Then Hektor in close combat struck Leitos son of noble Alektryon in\n    the hand by the wrist, and disabled him from fighting further. He looked about\n    him in dismay, knowing that never again should he wield spear in battle with\n    the Trojans. While Hektor was in pursuit of Leitos, Idomeneus struck him on the\n    breastplate over his chest near the nipple; but the spear broke in the shaft,\n    and the Trojans cheered aloud. Hektor then aimed at Idomeneus son of Deukalion\n    as he was standing on his chariot, and very narrowly missed him, but the spear\n    hit Koiranos, a follower and charioteer of Meriones who had come with him from\n    Lyktos. Idomeneus had left the ships on foot and would have afforded a great\n    triumph to the Trojans if Koiranos had not driven quickly up to him, he\n    therefore brought life and rescue to Idomeneus, but himself fell by the hand of\n    murderous Hektor. For Hektor hit him on the jaw under the ear; the end of the\n    spear drove out his teeth and cut his tongue in two pieces, so that he fell\n    from his chariot and let the reins fall to the ground. Meriones gathered them\n    up from the ground and took them into his own hands, then he said to Idomeneus,\n    \"Lay on, till you get back to the ships, for you must see that the day is no\n    longer ours.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"624\" unit=\"line\"/>On this Idomeneus lashed the horses to the\n    ships, for fear had taken hold upon him. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"626"},{"n":"626","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"626\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"626\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax and Menelaos noted how Zeus had turned the\n    scale in favor of the Trojans, and Ajax was first to speak. \"Alas,\" said he,\n    \"even a fool may see that father Zeus is helping the Trojans.

I wish that some one would go and tell the\n    son of Peleus at once, for I do not think he can have yet heard the sad news\n    that the dearest of his friends has fallen. But I can see not a man among the\n    Achaeans to send, for they and their chariots are alike hidden in darkness.

Ajax then said to Menelaos, \"Look,\n    Menelaos, and if Antilokhos son of Nestor be still living, send him at once to\n    tell Achilles that by far the dearest to him of all his comrades has fallen.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"656\" unit=\"line\"/>Menelaos heeded his words and went his way as a\n    lion from a stockyard - the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds, who\n    keep watch the whole night through and will not let him feast on the fat of\n    their herd. In his lust of meat he makes straight at them but in vain, for\n    darts from strong hands assail him, and burning brands which daunt him for all\n    his hunger, so in the morning he slinks sulkily away - even so did Menelaos\n    sorely against his will leave Patroklos, in great fear lest the Achaeans should\n    be driven back in rout and let him fall into the hands of the foe. He charged\n    Meriones and the two Ajaxes straitly saying, \"Ajaxes and Meriones, leaders of\n    the Argives, now indeed remember how good Patroklos was; he was ever courteous\n    while alive, bear it in mind now that he is dead.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"673\" unit=\"line\"/>With this Menelaos left them, looking round him\n    as keenly as an eagle, whose sight they say is keener than that of any other\n    bird - however high he may be in the heavens, not a hare that runs can escape\n    him by crouching under bush or thicket, for he will swoop down upon it and make\n    an end of it - even so, O Menelaos, did your keen eyes range round the mighty\n    host of your followers to see if you could find the son of Nestor still alive.\n    Presently Menelaos saw him on the extreme left of the battle cheering on his\n    men and exhorting them to fight boldly.

You must see with your own eyes that heaven is heaping calamity upon\n    the Danaans, and giving victory to the Trojans.

Nor were you, O Menelaos,\n    minded to succor his harassed comrades, when Antilokhos had left the Pylians -\n    and greatly did they miss him - but he sent them noble Thrasymedes, and himself\n    went back to Patroklos. He came running up to the two Ajaxes and said, \"I have\n    sent Antilokhos to the ships to tell Achilles, but rage against Hektor as he\n    may, he cannot come, for he cannot fight without armor.
