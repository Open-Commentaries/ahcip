There, sitting in the midst\n    of them, he asked what Zeus' purpose might be. \"Why,\" said he, \"wielder of the\n    lightning, have you called the gods in council?

If\n    Achilles fights the Trojans without hindrance they will make no stand against\n    him; they have ever trembled at the sight of him, and now that he is roused to\n    such fury about his comrade, he will override fate itself and storm their\n    city.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"31\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus spoke Zeus and gave the word for war,\n    whereon the gods took their several sides and went into battle. Hera, Pallas\n    Athena, earth-encircling Poseidon, Hermes bringer of good luck and excellent in\n    all cunning - all these joined the host that came from the assembly [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ag√¥n</term>] of ships; with them also came Hephaistos in all\n    his glory, limping, but yet with his thin legs plying lustily under him.

There was not a Trojan but his limbs failed him for\n    fear as he beheld the fleet son of Peleus all glorious in his armor, and\n    looking like Ares himself. When, however, the Olympians came to take their part\n    among men, forthwith uprose strong Strife, rouser of hosts, and Athena raised\n    her loud voice, now standing by the deep trench that ran outside the wall, and\n    now shouting with all her might upon the shore of the sounding sea. Ares also\n    bellowed out upon the other side, dark as some black thunder-cloud, and called\n    on the Trojans at the top of his voice, now from the acropolis, and now\n    speeding up the side of the river Simoeis till he came to the hill Kallikolone. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"54\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did the gods spur on both hosts to fight,\n    and rouse fierce contention also among themselves. The sire of gods and men\n    thundered from heaven above, while from beneath Poseidon shook the vast earth,\n    and bade the high hills tremble. The spurs and crests of many-fountained Ida\n    quaked, as also the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Achaeans. Hades,\n    king of the realms below, was struck with fear; he sprang panic-stricken from\n    his throne and cried aloud in terror lest Poseidon, lord of the earthquake,\n    should crack the ground over his head, and lay bare his moldy mansions to the\n    sight of mortals and immortals - mansions so ghastly grim that even the gods\n    shudder to think of them. Such was the uproar as the gods came together in\n    battle. Apollo with his arrows took his stand to face King Poseidon, while\n    Athena took hers against the god of war; the archer-goddess Artemis with her\n    golden arrows, sister of far-darting Apollo, stood to face Hera; Hermes the\n    lusty bringer of good luck faced Leto, while the mighty eddying river whom men\n    can Skamandros, but gods <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName>,\n    matched himself against Hephaistos. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"75\" unit=\"line\"/>The gods, then, were thus ranged against one\n    another.

Meanwhile Apollo set Aeneas on to attack the son of Peleus, and\n    put courage into his heart, speaking with the voice of Lykaon son of Priam. In\n    his likeness therefore, he said to Aeneas, \"Aeneas, counselor of the Trojans,\n    where are now the brave words with which you vaunted over your wine before the\n    Trojan princes, saying that you would fight Achilles son of Peleus in single\n    combat?\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"86"},{"n":"86","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"86\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"86\" unit=\"line\"/>And Aeneas answered, \"Why do you thus bid me\n    fight the proud son of Peleus, when I am in no mind to do so?

Nor did the son of Anchises escape the notice of white-armed\n    Hera, as he went forth into the throng to meet Achilles. She called the gods\n    about her, and said, \"Look to it, you two, Poseidon and Athena, and consider\n    how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full armor to\n    fight Achilles. Shall we turn him back at once, or shall one of us stand by\n    Achilles and endow him with strength so that his heart fail not, and he may\n    learn that the chiefs of the immortals are on his side, while the others who\n    have all along been defending the Trojans are but vain helpers?

Meanwhile the whole plain\n    was alive with men and horses, and blazing with the gleam of armor. The earth\n    rang again under the tramp of their feet as they rushed towards each other, and\n    two champions, by far the foremost of them all, met between the hosts to fight\n    - to wit, Aeneas son of Anchises, and noble Achilles. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"161\" unit=\"line\"/>Aeneas was first to stride forward in attack,\n    his doughty helmet tossing defiance as he came on.

Erichthonios begat Tros,\n    king of the Trojans, and Tros had three noble sons, Ilos, Assarakos, and\n    Ganymede who was comeliest of mortal men; wherefore the gods carried him off to\n    be Zeus' cupbearer, for his beauty's sake, that he might dwell among the\n    immortals.

He struck him on the temple through his\n    bronze-cheeked helmet. The helmet did not stay the spear, but it went right on,\n    crushing the bone so that the brain inside was shed in all directions, and his\n    lust of fighting was ended. Then he struck Hippodamas in the midriff as he was\n    springing down from his chariot in front of him, and trying to escape.

The point of the spear pierced him through and\n    came out by the navel, whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of\n    darkness overshadowed him as he sank holding his entrails in his hands. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"419\" unit=\"line\"/>When Hektor saw his brother Polydoros with his\n    entrails in his hands and sinking down upon the ground, a mist came over his\n    eyes, and he could not bear to keep longer at a distance; he therefore poised\n    his spear and darted towards Achilles like a flame of fire. When Achilles saw\n    him he bounded forward and vaunted saying, \"This is he that has wounded my\n    heart most deeply and has slain my beloved comrade. Not for long shall we two\n    quail before one another on the highways of war.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"428\" unit=\"line\"/>He looked fiercely on Hektor and said, \"Draw\n    near, that you may meet your doom the sooner.\" Hektor feared him not and\n    answered, \"Son of Peleus, think not that your words can scare me as though I\n    were a child; I too if I will can brag and talk unseemly; I know that you are a\n    mighty warrior, mightier by far than I, nevertheless the issue lies in the lap\n    of heaven whether I, worse man though I be, may not slay you with my spear, for\n    this too has been found keen ere now.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"438"},{"n":"438","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"438\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"438\" unit=\"line\"/>He hurled his spear as he spoke, but Athena\n    breathed upon it, and though she breathed but very lightly she turned it back\n    from going towards Achilles, so that it returned to Hektor and lay at his feet\n    in front of him. Achilles then sprang furiously on him with a loud cry, bent on\n    killing him, but Apollo caught him up easily as a god can, and hid him in a\n    thick darkness. Thrice did Achilles spring towards him spear in hand, and\n    thrice did he waste his blow upon the air. When he rushed forward for the\n    fourth time as though he were a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daim√¥n</term> he shouted\n    aloud saying, \"Hound, this time too you have escaped death - but of a truth it\n    came exceedingly near you. Phoebus Apollo, to whom it seems you pray before you\n    go into battle, has again saved you; but if I too have any friend among the\n    gods I will surely make an end of you when I come across you at some other\n    time. Now, however, I will pursue and overtake other Trojans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he struck Dryops with his spear, about\n    the middle of his neck, and he fell headlong at his feet. There he let him lie\n    and stayed Demoukhos son of Philetor, a man both brave and of great stature, by\n    hitting him on the knee with a spear; then he smote him with his sword and\n    killed him. After this he sprang on Laogonos and <placeName key=\"perseus,Dardanos\">Dardanos</placeName>, sons of Bias, and threw them\n    from their chariot, the one with a blow from a thrown spear, while the other he\n    cut down in hand-to-hand fight. There was also Tros the son of Alastor - he\n    came up to Achilles and clasped his knees in the hope that he would spare him\n    and not kill him but let him go, because they were both of the same age. Fool,\n    he might have known that he should not prevail with him, for the man was in no\n    mood for pity or forbearance but was in grim earnest. Therefore when Tros laid\n    hold of his knees and sought a hearing for his prayers, Achilles drove his\n    sword into his liver, and the liver came rolling out, while his bosom was all\n    covered with the black blood that welled from the wound. Thus did death close\n    his eyes as he lay lifeless. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"472\" unit=\"line\"/>Achilles then went up to Moulios and struck him\n    on the ear with a spear, and the bronze spear-head came right out at the other\n    ear. He also struck Echeklos son of Agenor on the head with his sword, which\n    became warm with the blood, while death and stern fate closed the eyes of\n    Echeklos. Next in order the bronze point of his spear wounded Deukalion in the\n    fore-arm where the sinews of the elbow are united, whereon he waited Achilles'\n    onset with his arm hanging down and death staring him in the face. Achilles cut\n    his head off with a blow from his sword and flung it helmet and all away from\n    him, and the marrow came oozing out of his backbone as he lay. He then went in\n    pursuit of Rhigmos, noble son of Peires, who had come from fertile <placeName key=\"tgn,7002756\">Thrace</placeName>, and struck him through the middle with\n    a spear which fixed itself in his belly, so that he fell headlong from his\n    chariot. He also speared Areithoos squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therap√¥n</term>] to Rhigmos in the back as he was turning his horses in\n    flight, and thrust him from his chariot, while the horses were struck with\n    panic. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>As a fire raging in some mountain glen after\n    long drought - and the dense forest is in a blaze, while the wind carries great\n    tongues of fire in every direction - even so furiously did Achilles rage,\n    wielding his spear as though he were a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daim√¥n</term>, and\n    giving chase to those whom he would slay, till the dark earth ran with blood.\n    Or as one who yokes broad-browed oxen that they may tread barley in a\n    threshing-floor - and it is soon bruised small under the feet of the lowing\n    cattle - even so did the horses of Achilles trample on the shields and bodies\n    of the slain. The axle underneath and the railing that ran round the car were\n    bespattered with clots of blood thrown up by the horses' hoofs, and from the\n    tires of the wheels; but the son of Peleus pressed on to win still further\n    glory, and his hands were bedrabbled with gore. <milestone n=\"503\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
