He was stripping of his armour huge Periphas that was far the best of the Aetolians, the glorious son of Ochesius.

Then brazen Ares bellowed<milestone n=\"860\" unit=\"line\"/>loud as nine thousand warriors or ten thousand cry in battle, when they join in the strife of the War-god; and thereat trembling came upon Achaeans alike and Trojans, and fear gat hold of them; so mightily bellowed Ares insatiate of war.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"864"},{"n":"864","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"864\">\n    <p>\n    Even as a black darkness appeareth from the clouds<milestone n=\"865\" unit=\"line\"/>when after heat a blustering wind ariseth, even in such wise unto Diomedes, son of Tydeus, did brazen Ares appear, as he fared amid the clouds unto broad heaven.
