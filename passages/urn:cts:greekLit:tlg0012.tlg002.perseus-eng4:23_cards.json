For it was wrought to be a great\n    sign [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>]; it is a marvelous curiosity which I\n    made with my very own hands. There was a young olive growing within the\n    precincts of the house, in full vigor, and about as thick as a bearing-post. I\n    built my room round this with strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,\n    and I made the doors strong and well-fitting.

This I dressed roughly from the\n    root upwards and then worked with carpenter's tools well and skillfully,\n    straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood, and making it into a\n    bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle, and made it the center-post of\n    my bed, at which I worked till I had finished it, inlaying it with gold and\n    silver; after this I stretched a hide of crimson leather from one side of it to\n    the other. So you see I know all about this sign [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>], and I desire to learn whether it is still there, or whether\n    any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its roots.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>When she heard the sure proofs [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêmata</term>] Odysseus now gave her, she fairly broke down.\n    She flew weeping to his side, flung her arms about his neck, and kissed him.\n    \"Do not be angry with me Odysseus,\" she cried, \"you, who are the wisest of\n    humankind.
