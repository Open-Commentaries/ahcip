in this narrative sequence, despite the fact that the women of Troy are shown here in the act of formally worshipping her as the divine protector of their citadel, can be correlated with a pattern of personal hostility felt by the goddess toward Hector as a hero who aspires to some of the same roles that Athena herself exemplifies. In the case of the verses here, I.06.286–311, this goddess is worshipped in her role as <em>protector of citadels under siege</em>: that is why Theano as high priestess of Troy prays to Athena by invoking her as <em>erusi-ptolis</em> ‘protector of the citadel [<em>p(t)olis</em>]’ at I.06.305. Like the goddess, Hector can be seen as an exponent of defensive tactics in protecting a citadel from sieges: as we saw in the comment on I.05.473–474, even his name fits his intended role as the protector of the citadel of Troy, since <em>Hék-tōr</em> is an agent noun derived from the verb <em>ekhein</em> ‘hold’ in the specialized sense of ‘uphold’ or ‘protect’ or ‘guard’. In the context of I.05.473–474, the expected role of Hector is <em>to protect the city of Troy</em>, and the direct object of <em>ekhein</em> ‘uphold, protect, guard’ at I.05.473 is <em>polis</em> ‘city, citadel’, referring to Troy. But the tragedy is, Hector will fail in the role of protecting Troy, since he will abandon strategies of defending the city and will opt instead for staying on the offensive against an enemy that will ultimately capture Troy. And a key to his failure, as we will see in the course of the macro-narrative, is the fact that Athena herself will delude Hector into staying on the offensive until it is too late for him to revert to a defensive role. Such a pattern of antagonism between immortal and mortal, it can be argued, derives from the ideologies of hero cult.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.286-6.311","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"cult hero"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"antagonism between immortal and mortal"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hero cult"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067001","title":"Iliad 6.286-296","body":"<p>Hecuba goes ahead and does what she has been told to do, which is, to offer a <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ for Athena as the goddess of the citadel of Troy. The repetition of ritual wording in the sequence of three passages—from I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296—will culminate in a master plan, as it were, for performing the ritual of presenting the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Troy. What has just been described as a “repetition,” however, needs to be explained further (HPC 268): </p><p>In this sequence of three passages [I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296], we see three consecutive restatements of the same ritual act. I say <em>three restatements</em> instead of <em>one statement and two restatements</em> because none of the three passages is basic, from the standpoint of traditional formulaic diction. Not one of the three passages is formulaically predictable on the basis of the other two passages. To put it another way, the variation that we find in the three passages shows that none of the three forms is formally prior to the other two. What priorities we find are purely a function of the narration, not of any chronological order in the composition of the three passages. In terms of oral poetics, such variation is a display of virtuosity in the art of composition in performance.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.286-6.296","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"split referencing"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"peplos ‘robe’ for Athena"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"peplos of Athena"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"pattern-weaving"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Panathenaic Peplos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067049","title":"Iliad 6.289-6.292","body":"<p>analysis of Herodotus’ concept of Homer and distinguishing him from the poet of the Cypria</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.289-6.292","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"pan-poikilo- ‘completely pattern-woven’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"detours of Helen"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"variant readings"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067116","title":"Iliad 6.289-6.292","body":"<p>analysis of Herodotus’ concept of Homer and distinguishing him from the poet of the Cypria</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.289-6.292","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067164","title":"Iliad 6.289","body":"<p>comparison of the wording in Sappho 44 with that in the presentation of the peplos to Athena in I.06</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.289","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067216","title":"Iliad 6.294","body":"<p>The noun <em>poikilma</em> at I.06.294 refers to ‘pattern-weaving’ in a concrete and not an abstract sense: so, ‘pattern-woven thing’.

On the Panathenaic Peplos, see again the comment on I.05.734–735; see also HPC 270. Looking back at the entire narrative sequence as analyzed here—I.06.090–093, I.06.271–273, I.06.286–296, I.06.297–310—I highlight two most salient visual details at Ι.06.297, namely, the citadel or acropolis of Troy and the temple on top of that acropolis. These two details correspond to the two most visible details distinguishing the city of Athens from most other cities. At work here is a process I describe as <em>split referencing</em>. The reference is split between Troy and Athens. The referent is both the prehistorical citadel of Troy and the historical citadel or acropolis of Athens. As for the narrative here at I.06.286-311 about the presentation of the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena, the <em>peplos</em> to be chosen is highlighted as the biggest of all the <em>peploi</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271, I.06.294). It is the <em>peplos</em> that is most ‘beautiful’ or <em>kalon</em> (I.06.294), with the most ‘pleasurable beauty’ or <em>kharis</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271). The size and the beauty of the fabric evoke a vision of the quadrennial Panathenaic Peplos, which is notionally the biggest and most beautiful of all imaginable <em>peploi</em>. As for the association of the word <em>kharis</em> ‘pleasurable beauty’ with the fabric, it is appropriate not only to the <em>peplos</em> that is being described but also to the medium that describes the <em>peplos</em>. That medium is Homeric poetry as performed at the quadrennial festival of the Panathenaia. The concept of <em>kharis</em> conveys the charisma of Homeric poetry as described by Homeric poetry. In terms of this description, the <em>peplos</em> in this narrative, I.06.286-311, can be seen as a metaphor for epic as performed at the Panathenaia. This epic is notionally the biggest and the most beautiful of all epics. Like the <em>peplos</em> that is being offered by the women to Athena, this epic as performed at the Panathenaia has more <em>kharis</em> than all other epics.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.297-6.310","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Panathenaic Peplos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"split referencing"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"peplos of Athena"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"pattern-weaving"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067363","title":"Iliad 6.297","body":"<p>analysis of Athena Polias and Zeus Polieus at Athens, and here, of this passage as suggesting an association of them in cult on the Trojan acropolis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.297","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067425","title":"Iliad 6.302-6.303","body":"<p>analysis of the statue of Athena on the Athenian acropolis with the passage from Iliad as an illustration</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.302-6.303","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067472","title":"Iliad 6.304","body":"<p>in the context of discussing ērato and Arētē</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.304","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067518","title":"Iliad 6.305-6.311","body":"<p>in a list of examples of Homeric prayers, in the context of analyzing the meaning of eukhesthai in formula (A) and here specifically the Homeric notion of prayer</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.305-6.311","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067564","title":"Iliad 6.305-6.311","body":"<p>analysis and comparison of uoueō with eukhesthai</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.305-6.311","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067610","title":"Iliad 6.305-6.311","body":"<p>analysis of the attestations of eukhesthai + future infinitive, where eukhesthai has been translated as ‘vow’ rather than ‘pray’, and arguing that they are not significant transformations of the prayer structure</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.305-6.311","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.067952","title":"Iliad 6.305-6.309","body":"<p>analysis of Arete’s pose as evidence for the pose of the statue of Athena Polias in Athens</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.305-6.309","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.068018","title":"Iliad 6.305","body":"<p>the one attestation of potni’ Athēnaiē in Homer, in the context of the analysis of the development of Greek posis compared with Vedic pati-</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.305","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.068064","title":"Iliad 6.311","body":"<p>analysis of the relation of the goddess and her image in the context of analyzing the statue of Athena on the Athenian acropolis (with this passage from Iliad as an illustration)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.311","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.068109","title":"Iliad 6.311","body":"<p>analysis of the formula (A), in which there is a series of variations in the verse as a totality, rather than its segments occurring as independent formulas</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.311","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.068159","title":"Iliad 6.325","body":"<p>Hector quarrels with Paris, as signaled by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’.

The second name for the son of Hector, Scamandrius [<em>Skamandrios</em>], I.06.402, derives from a rival Aeolian tradition, here undermined by the prevailing Ionian tradition of the <em>Iliad</em> (HPC 203–205). According to this rival tradition, as we read in Euripides <em>Andromache</em> 224 (together with the scholia for that verse), Scamandrius was a bastard son of Hector who survived the Trojan War, to be distinguished from the legitimate son of Hector and Andromache, Astyanax, who tragically failed to survive. According to Aeolian traditions, Scamandrius not only survived the Trojan War but later became king of Troy (scholia T for I.24.735). By contrast, according to the dominantly Ionian traditions as represented by the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, Scamandrius could not have survived if he was the same child as Astyanax, which is what we read here at I.06.402–403.

What now follows is a general introduction to what is meant here. Ancient Greek lament is a deeply ritualized ritual practice, and there are survivals of this practice even to this day in some Greek-speaking communities. For background on the continuities and the discontinuities of this practice, I recommend the book by Margaret Alexiou, <em>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition</em> (1974). Aside from the specific example of ancient Greek laments, there are many other examples of such a practice to be found in a wide variety of societies throughout the world. In general, lament is understood to mean the formal expression of the emotion that we know as sadness—or, to say it more formally, <em>sorrow</em>. In Homeric diction, the primary words that are used for referring to sorrow are <em>akhos</em> or <em>penthos</em>, both of which I ordinarily translate as ‘grief’. In the case of ancient Greek society as also in many other cases, however, the general definition of lament as an expression of sorrow is insufficient. A lament can be more than just an expression of some inner sorrow by way of outward signs like crying. The outward signs can be formalized by way of <em>crying</em> and <em>verbalizing</em> at the same time. And the act of verbalizing can even become an act of <em>singing</em>, as in the case of ancient Greek traditions. In terms of these traditions, the act of lamenting is an act of singing while crying and crying while singing. And this kind of singing <em>is</em> crying; this kind of crying <em>is</em> singing. The physical aspects of crying are all integrated into the singing: the flow of tears, the choking of the voice, the convulsions of the body, and so on, are all part of the singing. And such physical aspects are also formalized into a kinetic system of stylized movements—to be seen as a kind of <em>dancing</em> that is integrated with the <em>singing</em>. On such a kinetic aspect of lament, see further the comment on I.18.051–060.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:6.407-6.439","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"lament"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sorrows of Andromache"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.068615","title":"Iliad 6.407–439/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 1","body":"<p>In the Iliad, Andromache is represented as singing three songs of lament for Hector. Each one of these three laments is quoted, as it were, by the Master Narrator, and each one of the quotations corresponds morphologically to a genuine song of lament as sung by a lamenting woman. It must be emphasized, however, that the laments that we see being quoted by the epic of Homeric poety do not represent the actual meter of lament as sung in real laments. The genre of epic regularly uses its own meter, which is the dactylic hexameter, in representing other genres that it quotes, including unmetrical genres (Martin 1989:12–42; also pp. 87–88, specifically on lament). But the morphology of laments quoted by epic still follows the rules of lament. On this point about the morphology of lament, see further the comment on I.19.282–302. In other words, each quotation of each one of the three laments performed by Andromache is meant to be heard as a re-enactment, performed by the Master Narrator, of a genuine song of lament. In the first lament, as quoted by the Master Narrator here at I.06.407–439, Andromache is already lamenting the death of Hector before he is even dead. As for the second lament, at I.22.477–514, Andromache will sing it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for the third lament, at I.24.725–745, Andromache will sing it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. The first two laments can be seen as previews, as it were, of the more formal third lament. But it must be kept in mind that the traditions of lamentation can allow for the spontaneous singing of a lament as an instant response to a deep loss that has just happened—or even as a premonition of a future loss that has yet to happen.
