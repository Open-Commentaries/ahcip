This made Odysseus very angry, and he doubted\n    whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and there, or to let\n    them sleep one more and last time with the suitors. His heart growled within\n    him, and as a bitch with puppies growls and shows her teeth when she sees a\n    stranger, so did his heart growl with anger at the evil deeds that were being\n    done: but he beat his breast and said, \"Heart, be still, you had worse than\n    this to bear on the day when the terrible <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in silence\n    till your cunning got you safe out of the cave, though you made sure of being\n    killed.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"22\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus he chided with his heart, and checked it\n    into endurance, but he tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and\n    fat in front of a hot fire, doing it first on one side and then on the other,\n    that he may get it cooked as soon as possible, even so did he turn himself\n    about from side to side, thinking all the time how, single handed as he was, he\n    should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked suitors. But by\n    and by Athena came down from heaven in the likeness of a woman, and hovered\n    over his head saying, \"My poor unhappy man, why do you lie awake in this way?\n    This is your house: your wife is safe inside it, and so is your son who is just\n    such a young man as any father may be proud of.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"36\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Goddess,\" answered Odysseus, \"all that you have\n    said is true, but I am in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these\n    wicked suitors single handed, seeing what a number of them there always are.\n    And there is this further difficulty, which is still more considerable.\n    Supposing that with Zeus’ and your assistance I succeed in killing them, I must\n    ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it is all\n    over.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"44\" unit=\"line\"/>\"For shame,\" replied Athena, \"why, any one else\n    would trust a worse ally than myself, even though that ally were only a mortal\n    and less wise than I am.
