As when fair Hera's lord flashes his lightning in\n    token of great rain or hail or snow when the snow-flakes whiten the ground, or\n    again as a sign that he will open the wide jaws of hungry war, even so did\n    Agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh, for his soul trembled within him. When he\n    looked upon the plain of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> he\n    marveled at the many watchfires burning in front of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, and at the sound of pipes and flutes\n    and of the hum of men, but when presently he turned towards the ships and hosts\n    of the Achaeans, he tore his hair by handfuls before Zeus on high, and groaned\n    aloud for the very disquietness of his soul. In the end he deemed it best to go\n    at once to Nestor son of Neleus, and see if between them they could find any\n    way of the Achaeans from destruction. He therefore rose, put on his shirt,\n    bound his sandals about his comely feet, flung the skin of a huge tawny lion\n    over his shoulders - a skin that reached his feet- and took his spear in his\n    hand. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>Neither could Menelaos sleep, for he, too, boded\n    ill for the Argives who for his sake had sailed from far over the seas to fight\n    the Trojans. He covered his broad back with the skin of a spotted panther, put\n    a casque of bronze upon his head, and took his spear in his brawny hand. Then\n    he went to rouse his brother, who was by far the most powerful of the Achaeans,\n    and was honored in his district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dÃªmos</term>] as though\n    he were a god. He found him by the stern of his ship already putting his goodly\n    array about his shoulders, and right glad was he that his brother had come. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"34\" unit=\"line\"/>Menelaos spoke first. \"Why,\" said he, \"my dear\n    brother, are you thus arming? Are you going to send any of our comrades to\n    exploit the Trojans? I greatly fear that no one will do you this service, and\n    spy upon the enemy alone in the dead of night. It will be a deed of great\n    daring.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"42\" unit=\"line\"/>And King Agamemnon answered, \"Menelaos, we both\n    of us need shrewd counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Zeus has\n    changed his mind, and inclines towards Hektor's sacrifices rather than ours. I\n    never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one day as\n    Hektor has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans - and that too of his\n    own unaided self, for he is son neither to god nor goddess. The Argives will\n    rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the\n    ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneus. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him\n    rise and go about among the companies of our sentinels to give them their\n    instructions; they will listen to him sooner than to any man, for his own son,\n    and Meriones brother in arms to Idomeneus, are leaders over them. It was to\n    them more particularly that we gave this charge.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"60\" unit=\"line\"/>Menelaos replied, \"How do I take your meaning?\n    Am I to stay with them and wait your coming, or shall I return here as soon as\n    I have given your orders?\" \"Wait,\" answered King Agamemnon, \"for there are so\n    many paths about the camp that we might miss one another. Call every man on\n    your way, and bid him be stirring; name him by his lineage and by his father's\n    name, give each all titular observance, and stand not too much upon your own\n    dignity; we must take our full share of toil, for at our birth Zeus laid this\n    heavy burden upon us.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"72\" unit=\"line\"/>With these instructions he sent his brother on\n    his way, and went on to Nestor shepherd of his people. He found him sleeping in\n    his tent hard by his own ship; his goodly armor lay beside him - his shield,\n    his two spears and his helmet; beside him also lay the gleaming belt with which\n    the old man girded himself when he armed to lead his people into battle - for\n    his age stayed him not. He raised himself on his elbow and looked up at\n    Agamemnon. \"Who is it,\" said he, \"that goes thus about the host and the ships\n    alone and in the dead of night, when men are sleeping? Are you looking for one\n    of your mules or for some comrade? Do not stand there and say nothing, but\n    speak. What is your business?\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"87\" unit=\"line\"/>And Agamemnon answered, \"Nestor, son of Neleus,\n    honor to the Achaean name, it is I, Agamemnon son of Atreus, on whom Zeus has\n    laid labor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponoi</term>] and sorrow so long as there is\n    breath in my body and my limbs carry me. I am thus abroad because sleep sits\n    not upon my eyelids, but my heart is big with war and with the jeopardy of the\n    Achaeans. I am in great fear for the Danaans. I am at sea, and without sure\n    counsel; my heart beats as though it would leap out of my body, and my limbs\n    fail me. If then you can do anything - for you too cannot sleep - let us go the\n    round of the watch, and see whether they are drowsy with toil and sleeping to\n    the neglect of their duty. The enemy is encamped hard and we know not but he\n    may attack us by night.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"102\" unit=\"line\"/>Nestor replied, \"Most noble son of Atreus, king\n    of men, Agamemnon, Zeus will not do all for Hektor that Hektor thinks he will;\n    he will have troubles yet in plenty if Achilles will lay aside his anger. I\n    will go with you, and we will rouse others, either the son of Tydeus, or\n    Odysseus, or fleet Ajax and the valiant son of Phyleus. Some one had also\n    better go and call Ajax and King Idomeneus, for their ships are not near at\n    hand but the farthest of all. I cannot however refrain from blaming Menelaos,\n    much as I love him and respect him -</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"115"},{"n":"115","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"115\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"115\" unit=\"line\"/>and I will say so plainly, even at the risk of\n    offending you - for sleeping and leaving all this trouble to yourself.

On this occasion,\n    however, he was awake before I was, and came to me of his own accord. I have\n    already sent him to call the very men whom you have named. And now let us be\n    going. We shall find them with the watch outside the gates, for it was there I\n    said that we would meet them.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"127\" unit=\"line\"/>\"In that case,\" answered Nestor, \"the Argives\n    will not blame him nor disobey his orders when he urges them to fight or gives\n    them instructions.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"131\" unit=\"line\"/>With this he put on his shirt, and bound his\n    sandals about his comely feet. He buckled on his purple coat, of two\n    thicknesses, large, and of a rough shaggy texture, grasped his redoubtable\n    bronze-shod spear, and wended his way along the line of the Achaean ships.\n    First he called loudly to Odysseus peer of gods in counsel and woke him, for he\n    was soon roused by the sound of the battle-cry. He came outside his tent and\n    said, \"Why do you go thus alone about the host, and along the line of the ships\n    in the stillness of the night? What is it that you find so urgent?\" And Nestor\n    horseman of Gerene answered, \"Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, take it not amiss, for the\n    Achaeans are in great sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>]. Come with me\n    and let us wake some other, who may advise well with us whether we shall fight\n    or flee.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"148\" unit=\"line\"/>On this Odysseus went at once into his tent,\n    put his shield about his shoulders and came out with them. First they went to\n    Diomedes son of Tydeus, and found him outside his tent clad in his armor with\n    his comrades sleeping round him and using their shields as pillows; as for\n    their spears,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"153\" unit=\"line\"/>they stood upright on the spikes of their butts\n    that were driven into the ground, and the burnished bronze flashed afar like\n    the lightning of father Zeus. The hero was sleeping upon the skin of an ox,\n    with a piece of fine carpet under his head; Nestor went up to him and stirred\n    him with his heel to rouse him, upbraiding him and urging him to bestir\n    himself. \"Wake up,\" he exclaimed, \"son of Tydeus. How can you sleep on in this\n    way? Can you not see that the Trojans are encamped on the brow of the plain\n    hard by our ships, with but a little space between us and them?\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"162\" unit=\"line\"/>On these words Diomedes leaped up instantly and\n    said, \"Old man, your heart is of iron; you rest not one moment from your labors\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>]. Are there no younger men among the\n    Achaeans who could go about to rouse the princes? There is no tiring you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"168\" unit=\"line\"/>And Nestor horseman of Gerene made answer, \"My\n    son, all that you have said is true. I have good sons, and also many people who\n    might call the chieftains, but the Achaeans are in the gravest danger; life and\n    death are balanced as it were on the edge of a razor. Go then, for you are\n    younger than I, and of your courtesy rouse Ajax and the fleet son of Phyleus.\"\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"177"},{"n":"177","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"177\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"177\" unit=\"line\"/>Diomedes threw the skin of a great tawny lion\n    about his shoulders - a skin that reached his feet - and grasped his spear.\n    When he had roused the heroes, he brought them back with him; they then went\n    the round of those who were on guard, and found the leaders not sleeping at\n    their posts but wakeful and sitting with their arms about them. As sheep dogs\n    that watch their flocks when they are yarded, and hear a wild beast coming\n    through the mountain forest towards them - forthwith there is a hue and cry of\n    dogs and men, and slumber is broken - even so was sleep chased from the eyes of\n    the Achaeans as they kept the watches of the wicked night, for they turned\n    constantly towards the plain whenever they heard any stir among the Trojans.\n    The old man was glad bade them be of good cheer. \"Watch on, my children,\" said\n    he, \"and let not sleep get hold upon you, lest our enemies triumph over us.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"194\" unit=\"line\"/>With this he passed the trench, and with him\n    the other chiefs of the Achaeans who had been called to the council. Meriones\n    and the brave son of Nestor went also, for the princes bade them. When they\n    were beyond the trench that was dug round the wall they held their meeting on\n    the open ground where there was a space clear of corpses, for it was here that\n    when night fell Hektor had turned back from his onslaught on the Argives. They\n    sat down, therefore, and held debate with one another. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"203\" unit=\"line\"/>Nestor spoke first. \"My friends,\" said he, \"is\n    there any man bold enough to venture the Trojans, and cut off some straggler,\n    or us news of what the enemy mean to do whether they will stay here by the\n    ships away from the city, or whether, now that they have worsted the Achaeans,\n    they will retire within their walls. If he could learn all this and come back\n    safely here, his fame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] would be high as\n    heaven in the mouths of all men, and he would be rewarded richly; for the\n    chiefs from all our ships would each of them give him a black ewe with her lamb\n    - which is a present of surpassing value - and he would be asked as a guest to\n    all feasts and clan-gatherings.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"218\" unit=\"line\"/>They all held their peace, but Diomedes of the\n    loud war-cry spoke saying, \"Nestor, gladly will I visit the host of the Trojans\n    over against us, but if another will go with me I shall do so in greater\n    confidence and comfort. When two men are together, one of them may see some\n    opportunity [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>] which the other has not caught\n    sight of; if a man is alone he is less full of resource, and his wit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] is weaker.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"227\" unit=\"line\"/>On this several offered to go with Diomedes.\n    The two Ajaxes, squires [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapontes</term>] of Ares,\n    Meriones, and the son of Nestor all wanted to go, so did Menelaos son of\n    Atreus; Odysseus also wished to go among the host of the Trojans, for he was\n    ever full of daring, and thereon Agamemnon king of men spoke thus: \"Diomedes,\"\n    said he, \"son of Tydeus, man after my own heart, choose your comrade for\n    yourself - take the best man of those that have offered, for many would now go\n    with you. Do not through delicacy reject the better man, and take the worst out\n    of respect [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidÃ´s</term>] for his lineage, because he is\n    of more royal blood.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"240\" unit=\"line\"/>He said this because he feared for Menelaos.\n    Diomedes answered, \"If you bid me take the man of my own choice, how in that\n    case can I fail to think of Odysseus, than whom there is no man more eager to\n    face all kinds of danger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponoi</term>] - and Pallas\n    Athena loves him well?

Brave Thrasymedes\n    provided the son of Tydeus with a sword and a shield (for he had left his own\n    at his ship) and on his head he set a helmet of bull's hide without either peak\n    or crest; it is called a skull-cap and is a common headgear. Meriones found a\n    bow and quiver for Odysseus, and on his head he set a leathern helmet that was\n    lined with a strong plaiting of leathern thongs, while on the outside it was\n    thickly studded with boar's teeth, well and skillfully set into it; next the\n    head there was an inner lining of felt. This helmet had been stolen by\n    Autolykos out of Eleon when he broke into the house of Amyntor son of Ormenus.\n    He gave it to Amphidamas of <placeName key=\"tgn,7010869\">Cythera</placeName> to\n    take to Scandea, and Amphidamas gave it as a guest-gift to Molos, who gave it\n    to his son Meriones; and now it was set upon the head of Odysseus. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"272"},{"n":"272","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"272\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"272\" unit=\"line\"/>When the pair had armed, they set out, and left\n    the other chieftains behind them. Pallas Athena sent them a heron by the\n    wayside upon their right hands; they could not see it for the darkness, but\n    they heard its cry. Odysseus was glad when he heard it and prayed to\n    Athena:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"277\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Hear me,\" he cried, \"daughter of aegis-bearing\n    Zeus, you who spy out all my ways and who are with me in all my hardships\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponoi</term>]; befriend me in this mine hour, and\n    grant that we may return to the ships covered with glory after having achieved\n    some mighty exploit that shall bring sorrow to the Trojans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"283\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Diomedes of the loud war-cry also prayed:\n    \"Hear me too,\" said he, \"daughter of Zeus, unweariable; be with me even as you\n    were with my noble father Tydeus when he went to <placeName key=\"perseus,Thebes\">Thebes</placeName> as envoy sent by the Achaeans. He\n    left the Achaeans by the banks of the river Aesopos, and went to the city\n    bearing a message of peace to the Cadmeans; on his return thence, with your\n    help, goddess, he did great deeds of daring, for you were his ready helper.\n    Even so guide me and guard me now, and in return I will offer you in sacrifice\n    a broad-browed heifer of a year old, unbroken, and never yet brought by man\n    under the yoke.

When they had done praying to the daughter of great Zeus, they went\n    their way like two lions prowling by night amid the armor and blood-stained\n    bodies of them that had fallen. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"299\" unit=\"line\"/>Neither again did Hektor let the Trojans sleep;\n    for he too called the princes and councilors of the Trojans that he might set\n    his counsel before them. \"Is there one,\" said he, \"who for a great reward will\n    do me the service of which I will tell you? He shall be well paid if he will. I\n    will give him a chariot and a couple of horses, the fleetest that can be found\n    at the ships of the Achaeans, if he will dare this thing; and he will win\n    infinite honor to boot; he must go to the ships and find out whether they are\n    still guarded as heretofore, or whether now that we have beaten them the\n    Achaeans design to flee, and through sheer exhaustion are neglecting to keep\n    their watches.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"313\" unit=\"line\"/>They all held their peace; but there was among\n    the Trojans a certain man named Dolon, son of Eumedes, the famous herald - a\n    man rich in gold and bronze.

When he had left the horses and the troops\n    behind him, he made all speed on his way, but Odysseus perceived his coming and\n    said to Diomedes, \"Diomedes, here is some one from the camp; I am not sure\n    whether he is a spy, or whether it is some thief who would plunder the bodies\n    of the dead; let him get a little past us, we can then spring upon him and take\n    him.

Dolon suspected nothing and soon passed them, but when\n    he had got about as far as the distance by which a mule-plowed furrow exceeds\n    one that has been ploughed by oxen (for mules can plow fallow land quicker than\n    oxen) they ran after him, and when he heard their footsteps he stood still, for\n    he made sure they were friends from the Trojan camp come by Hektor's orders to\n    bid him return; when, however, they were only a spear's cast, or less away form\n    him, he saw that they were enemies as fast as his legs could take him. The\n    others gave chase at once, and as a couple of well-trained hounds press forward\n    after a doe or hare that runs screaming in front of them, even so did the son\n    of Tydeus and Odysseus pursue Dolon and cut him off from his own people. But\n    when he had fled so far towards the ships that he would soon have fallen in\n    with the outposts, Athena infused fresh strength into the son of Tydeus for\n    fear some other of the Achaeans might have the glory of being first to hit him,\n    and he might himself be only second; he therefore sprang forward with his spear\n    and said, \"Stand, or I shall throw my spear, and in that case I shall soon make\n    an end of you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"372\" unit=\"line\"/>He threw as he spoke, but missed his aim on\n    purpose.

The two came breathless up to him and seized his\n    hands, whereon he began to weep and said, \"Take me alive; I will ransom myself;\n    we have great store of gold, bronze, and wrought iron, and from this my father\n    will satisfy you with a very large ransom, should he hear of my being alive at\n    the ships of the Achaeans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"382\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Fear not,\" replied Odysseus, \"let no thought\n    of death be in your mind; but tell me, and tell me true, why are you thus going\n    about alone in the dead of night away from your camp and towards the ships,\n    while other men are sleeping?

If you want to\n    find your way into the host of the Trojans, there are the Thracians, who have\n    lately come here and lie apart from the others at the far end of the camp; and\n    they have Rhesus son of Eioneus for their king. His horses are the finest and\n    strongest that I have ever seen, they are whiter than snow and fleeter than any\n    wind that blows. His chariot is equipped with silver and gold, and he has\n    brought his marvelous golden armor, of the rarest workmanship - too splendid\n    for any mortal man to carry, and meet only for the gods. Now, therefore, take\n    me to the ships or bind me securely here, until you come back and have proved\n    my words whether they be false or true.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"447\" unit=\"line\"/>Diomedes looked sternly at him and answered,\n    \"Think not, Dolon, for all the good information you have given us, that you\n    shall escape now you are in our hands, for if we ransom you or let you go, you\n    will come some second time to the ships of the Achaeans either as a spy or as\n    an open enemy, but if I kill you and an end of you, you will give no more\n    trouble.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"454\" unit=\"line\"/>On this Dolon would have caught him by the\n    beard to beseech him further, but Diomedes struck him in the middle of his neck\n    with his sword and cut through both sinews so that his head fell rolling in the\n    dust while he was yet speaking. They took the ferret-skin cap from his head,\n    and also the wolf-skin, the bow, and his long spear. Odysseus hung them up\n    aloft in honor of Athena the goddess of plunder, and prayed saying, \"Accept\n    these, goddess, for we give them to you in preference to all the gods in\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>: therefore speed us still\n    further towards the horses and sleeping-ground of the Thracians.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he took the spoils and set\n    them upon a tamarisk tree, and they made a mark [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sÃªma</term>] at the place by pulling up reeds and gathering boughs of\n    tamarisk that they might not miss it as they came back through the fleeing\n    hours of darkness. The two then went onwards amid the fallen armor and the\n    blood, and came presently to the company of Thracian warriors, who were\n    sleeping, tired out with their day's toil; their goodly armor was lying on the\n    ground beside them all in order [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>], in three\n    rows, and each man had his yoke of horses beside him. Rhesus was sleeping in\n    the middle, and hard by him his horses were made fast to the topmost rim of his\n    chariot. Odysseus from some way off saw him and said, \"This, Diomedes, is the\n    man, and these are the horses about which Dolon whom we killed told us. Do your\n    very utmost; dally not about your armor, but loose the horses at once - or else\n    kill the men yourself, while I see to the horses.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"482\" unit=\"line\"/>Thereon Athena put courage into the heart of\n    Diomedes, and he smote them right and left. They made a hideous groaning as\n    they were being hacked about, and the earth was red with their blood. As a lion\n    springs furiously upon a flock of sheep or goats when he finds without their\n    shepherd, so did the son of Tydeus set upon the Thracian warriors till he had\n    killed twelve. As he killed them Odysseus came and drew them aside by their\n    feet one by one, that the horses might go forward freely without being\n    frightened as they passed over the dead bodies, for they were not yet used to\n    them. When the son of Tydeus came to the king, he killed him too (which made\n    thirteen), as he was breathing hard, for by the counsel of Athena an evil\n    dream, the seed of Oeneus, hovered that night over his head. Meanwhile Odysseus\n    untied the horses, made them fast one to another and drove them off, striking\n    them with his bow, for he had forgotten to take the whip from the chariot. Then\n    he whistled as a sign to Diomedes. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"503\" unit=\"line\"/>But Diomedes stayed where he was, thinking what\n    other daring deed he might accomplish. He was doubting whether to take the\n    chariot in which the king's armor was lying, and draw it out by the pole, or to\n    lift the armor out and carry it off; or whether again, he should not kill some\n    more Thracians. While he was thus hesitating Athena came up to him and said,\n    \"Make your homecoming [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>], Diomedes, to the\n    ships or you may be driven thither, should some other god rouse the Trojans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"512\" unit=\"line\"/>Diomedes knew that it was the goddess, and at\n    once sprang upon the horses. Odysseus beat them with his bow and they flew\n    onward to the ships of the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>But Apollo kept no blind look-out when he saw\n    Athena with the son of Tydeus. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of\n    the Trojans he roused HippokoÃ¶n, a counselor of the Thracians and a noble\n    kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep and saw that the horses were\n    no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their death-agony;\n    on this he groaned aloud, and called upon his friend by name. Then the whole\n    Trojan camp was in an uproar as the people kept hurrying together, and they\n    marveled at the deeds of the heroes who had now got away towards the ships.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"526"},{"n":"526","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"526\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"526\" unit=\"line\"/>When they reached the place where they had\n    killed Hektor's scout, Odysseus stayed his horses, and the son of Tydeus,\n    leaping to the ground, placed the blood-stained spoils in the hands of Odysseus\n    and remounted: then he lashed the horses onwards, and they flew forward nothing\n    loath towards the ships as though of their own free will. Nestor was first to\n    hear the tramp of their feet. \"My friends,\" said he, \"princes and counselors of\n    the Argives, shall I guess right or wrong? - but I must say what I think: there\n    is a sound in my ears as of the tramp of horses. I hope it may Diomedes and\n    Odysseus driving in horses from the Trojans, but I much fear that the bravest\n    of the Argives may have come to some harm at their hands.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>He had hardly done speaking when the two men\n    came in and dismounted, whereon the others shook hands right gladly with them\n    and congratulated them. Nestor horseman of Gerene was first to question them.\n    \"Tell me,\" said he, \"renowned Odysseus, how did you two come by these horses?\n    Did you steal in among the Trojan forces, or did some god meet you and give\n    them to you? They are like sunbeams. I am well conversant with the Trojans, for\n    old warrior though I am I never hold back by the ships, but I never yet saw or\n    heard of such horses as these are. Surely some god must have met you and given\n    them to you, for you are both of dear to Zeus, and to Zeus' daughter Athena.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"554\" unit=\"line\"/>And Odysseus answered, \"Nestor son of Neleus,\n    honor to the Achaean name, heaven, if it so will, can give us even better\n    horses than these, for the gods are far mightier than we are. These horses,\n    however, about which you ask me, are freshly come from <placeName key=\"tgn,7002756\">Thrace</placeName>. Diomedes killed their king with the\n    twelve bravest of his companions.

When they reached\n    the strongly built quarters of the son of Tydeus, they tied the horses with\n    thongs of leather to the manger, where the steeds of Diomedes stood eating\n    their sweet grain, but Odysseus hung the blood-stained spoils of Dolon at the\n    stern of his ship, that they might prepare a sacred offering to Athena. As for\n    themselves, they went into the sea and washed the sweat from their bodies, and\n    from their necks and thighs. When the sea-water had taken all the sweat from\n    off them, and had refreshed them, they went into the baths and washed\n    themselves. After they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil, they\n    sat down to table, and drawing from a full mixing-bowl, made a drink-offering\n    of wine to Athena.<milestone n=\"579\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
