We did not get on\n    much further, for in another moment we were caught by a terrific squall from\n    the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so that it fell aft, while all\n    the ship's gear tumbled about at the bottom of the vessel. The mast fell upon\n    the head of the helmsman in the ship's stern, so that the bones of his head\n    were crushed to pieces, and he fell overboard as though he were diving, with no\n    more life left in him.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Then Zeus let fly with his thunderbolts, and\n    the ship went round and round, and was filled with fire and brimstone as the\n    lightning struck it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in\n    the water round the ship, looking like so many sea-gulls, but the god presently\n    deprived them of all chance of getting home again [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>].</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"420"},{"n":"420","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"420\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her\n    sides from her keel (which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of\n    her in the direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong\n    still hanging about it, and with this I lashed the mast and keel together, and\n    getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to take me.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"426\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The gale from the West had now spent its\n    force, and the wind got into the South again, which frightened me lest I should\n    be taken back to the terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what\n    actually happened, for I was borne along by the waves all night, and by sunrise\n    had reached the rock of Scylla, and the whirlpool. She was then sucking down\n    the salt sea water, but I was carried aloft toward the fig tree, which I caught\n    hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not plant my feet anywhere so as to\n    stand securely, for the roots were a long way off and the boughs that\n    overshadowed the whole pool were too high, too vast, and too far apart for me\n    to reach them; so I hung patiently on, waiting till the pool should discharge\n    my mast and raft again - and a very long while it seemed. A juryman [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krînô</term>] is not more glad to get home to supper, after\n    having been long detained in court by troublesome cases, than I was to see my\n    raft beginning to work its way out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go\n    with my hands and feet, and fell heavily into the sea, hard by my raft on to\n    which I then got, and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla, the father of\n    gods and men would not let her get further sight of me - otherwise I should\n    have certainly been lost.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"447\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Hence I was carried along for nine days till\n    on the tenth night the gods stranded me on the Ogygian island, where dwells the\n    great and powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me, but I\n    need say no more about this, for I told you and your noble wife all about it\n    yesterday, and it is hateful [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ekhthron</term>] for me to\n    say the same thing over and over again.\" <milestone n=\"453\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
