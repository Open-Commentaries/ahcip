She met the goddesses at the outer gates of its many\n    valleys and gave them her message. \"What,\" said she, \"are you about? Are you\n    mad? The son of Kronos forbids going. This is what he says, and this is he\n    means to do, he will lame your horses for you, he will hurl you from your\n    chariot, and will break it in pieces. It will take you all ten years to heal\n    the wounds his lightning will inflict upon you, that you may learn, gray-eyed\n    goddess, what quarreling with your father means. He is less hurt and angry with\n    Hera, for whatever he says she always contradicts him but you, bold hussy, will\n    you really dare to raise your huge spear in defiance of Zeus?\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>With this she left them, and Hera said to\n    Athena, \"Of a truth, child of aegis-bearing Zeus, I am not for fighting men's\n    battles further in defiance of Zeus.

The two goddesses then sat down upon\n    their golden thrones, amid the company of the other gods; but they were very\n    angry. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"438\" unit=\"line\"/>Presently father Zeus drove his chariot to\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, and entered the assembly\n    of gods. The mighty lord of the earthquake unyoked his horses for him, set the\n    car upon its stand, and threw a cloth over it. Zeus then sat down upon his\n    golden throne and <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> reeled\n    beneath him. Athena and Hera sat alone, apart from Zeus, and neither spoke nor\n    asked him questions, but Zeus knew what they meant, and said, \"Athena and Hera,\n    why are you so angry? Are you fatigued with killing so many of your dear\n    friends the Trojans? Be this as it may, such is the might of my hands that all\n    the gods in <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> cannot turn me;\n    you were both of you trembling all over ere ever you saw the fight and its\n    terrible doings. I tell you therefore-and it would have surely been - I should\n    have struck you with lighting, and your chariots would never have brought you\n    back again to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"457\" unit=\"line\"/>Athena and Hera groaned in spirit as they sat\n    side by side and brooded mischief for the Trojans. Athena sat silent without a\n    word, for she was in a furious passion and bitterly incensed against her\n    father; but Hera could not contain herself and said, \"What, dread son of\n    Kronos, are you talking about? We know how great your power is, nevertheless we\n    have compassion upon the Danaan warriors who are perishing and coming to a bad\n    end.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain\n    from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the Argives,\n    that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"469\" unit=\"line\"/>And Zeus answered, \"Tomorrow morning, Hera, if\n    you choose to do so, you will see the son of Kronos destroying large numbers of\n    the Argives, for fierce Hektor shall not cease fighting till he has roused the\n    son of Peleus when they are fighting in dire straits at their ships' sterns\n    about the body of Patroklos. Like it or no, this is how it is decreed; for I\n    don't care, you may go to the lowest depths beneath earth and sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>], where Iapetos and Kronos dwell in lone\n    Tartaros with neither ray of light nor breath of wind to cheer them. You may go\n    on and on till you get there, and I shall not care one whit for your\n    displeasure; you are the greatest vixen living.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"484\" unit=\"line\"/>Hera made him no answer. The sun's glorious orb\n    now sank into Okeanos and drew down night over the land. Sorry indeed were the\n    Trojans when light failed them, but welcome and thrice prayed for did darkness\n    fall upon the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"489\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Hektor led the Trojans back from the\n    ships, and held a council on the open space near the river, where there was a\n    spot ear corpses. They left their chariots and sat down on the ground to hear\n    the speech he made them. He grasped a spear eleven cubits long, the bronze\n    point of which gleamed in front of it, while the ring round the spear-head was\n    of gold Spear in hand he spoke. \"Hear me,\" said he, \"Trojans, Dardanians, and\n    allies. I deemed but now that I should destroy the ships and all the Achaeans\n    with them ere I went back to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>,\n    but darkness came on too soon. It was this alone that saved them and their\n    ships upon the seashore. Now, therefore, let us obey the behests of night, and\n    prepare our suppers. Take your horses out of their chariots and give them their\n    feeds of grain; then make speed to bring sheep and cattle from the city;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"506\" unit=\"line\"/>bring wine also and grain for your horses and\n    gather much wood, that from dark till dawn we may burn watchfires whose flare\n    may reach to heaven. For the Achaeans may try to flee beyond the sea by night,\n    and they must not embark scatheless and unmolested; many a man among them must\n    take a dart with him to nurse at home, hit with spear or arrow as he is leaping\n    on board his ship, that others may fear to bring war and weeping upon the\n    Trojans. Moreover let the heralds tell it about the city that the growing\n    youths and gray-bearded men are to camp upon its heaven-built walls. Let the\n    women each of them light a great fire in her house, and let watch be safely\n    kept lest the town be entered by surprise while the host is outside. See to it,\n    brave Trojans, as I have said, and let this suffice for the moment; at daybreak\n    I will instruct you further. I pray in hope to Zeus and to the gods that we may\n    then drive those fate-sped hounds from our land, for ‘tis the fates that have\n    borne them and their ships hither. This night, therefore, let us keep watch,\n    but with early morning let us put on our armor and rouse fierce war at the\n    ships of the Achaeans; I shall then know whether brave Diomedes the son of\n    Tydeus will drive me back from the ships to the wall, or whether I shall myself\n    slay him and carry off his bloodstained spoils. Tomorrow let him show his\n    mettle [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aretê</term>], abide my spear if he dare. I ween\n    that at break of day, he shall be among the first to fall and many another of\n    his comrades round him. Would that I were as sure of being immortal and never\n    growing old, and of being worshipped like Athena and Apollo, as I am that this\n    day will bring evil to the Argives.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"542"},{"n":"542","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"542\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"542\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus spoke Hektor and the Trojans shouted\n    approval.
