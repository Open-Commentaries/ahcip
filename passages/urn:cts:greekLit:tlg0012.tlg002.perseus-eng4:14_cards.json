He found him sitting in front of his hut,\n    which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be seen from\n    far. He had made them spacious and fair to see, with a free ran for the pigs\n    all round them; he had built them during his master's absence, of stones which\n    he had gathered out of the ground, without saying anything to Penelope or\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, and he had fenced them\n    on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of oaken\n    posts, split, and set pretty close together, while inside lie had built twelve\n    sties near one another for the sows to lie in. There were fifty pigs wallowing\n    in each sty, all of them breeding sows; but the boars slept outside and were\n    much fewer in number, for the suitors kept on eating them, and the swineherd\n    had to send them the best he had continually. There were three hundred and\n    sixty boar pigs, and the herdsman's four hounds, which were as fierce as\n    wolves, slept always with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a\n    pair of sandals from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding\n    the pigs in one place or another, and he had sent the fourth to town with a\n    boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might sacrifice it\n    and have their fill of meat.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"29\" unit=\"line\"/>When the hounds saw Odysseus they set up a\n    furious barking and flew at him, but Odysseus was cunning enough to sit down\n    and loose his hold of the stick that he had in his hand: still, he would have\n    been torn by them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox\n    hide, rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off by\n    shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Odysseus, \"Old man, the\n    dogs were likely to have made short work of you, and then you would have got me\n    into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough worries without that, for I\n    have lost the best of masters, and am in continual grief on his account.

We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs, while others\n    reap the fruit of our labor.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"418\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he began chopping firewood, while the\n    others brought in a fine fat five year old boar pig, and set it at the altar.\n    Eumaios did not forget the gods, for he was a man of good principles, so the\n    first thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig's face and throw them into\n    the fire, praying to all the gods as he did so that Odysseus might return home\n    again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which he had kept back when\n    he was chopping the firewood, and its <term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê </term>left\n    it, while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up, and\n    Eumaios began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the fat;\n    these he sprinkled with barley meal, and laid upon the embers; they cut the\n    rest of the meat up small, put the pieces upon the spits and roasted them till\n    they were done; when they had taken them off the spits they threw them on to\n    the dresser in a heap. The swineherd, who was a most equitable man, then stood\n    up to give every one his share. He made seven portions; one of these he set\n    apart for Hermes the son of <placeName key=\"tgn,1049816\">Maia</placeName> and\n    the nymphs, praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt out to the men\n    man by man. He gave Odysseus some slices cut lengthways down the loin as a mark\n    of especial honor, and Odysseus was much pleased. \"I hope, Eumaios,\" said he,\n    \"that Zeus will be as well disposed towards you as I am, for the respect you\n    are showing to an outcast like myself.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"441"},{"n":"441","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"441\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"441\" unit=\"line\"/>To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaios,\n    \"Eat, my good fellow, and enjoy your supper, such as it is. A god grants this,\n    and withholds that, just as he thinks right, for he can do whatever he\n    chooses.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he cut off the first piece and\n    offered it as a burnt sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a\n    drink-offering, put the cup in the hands of Odysseus, and sat down to his own\n    portion. Mesaulios brought them their bread; the swineherd had bought this man\n    on his own account from among the Taphians during his master's absence, and had\n    paid for him with his own wealth without saying anything either to his mistress\n    or <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>. They then laid their\n    hands upon the good things that were before them, and when they had had enough\n    to eat and drink, Mesaulios took away what was left of the bread, and they all\n    went to bed after having made a hearty supper.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"457\" unit=\"line\"/>Now the night came on stormy and very dark, for\n    there was no moon. It poured without ceasing, and the wind blew strong from the\n    West, which is a wet quarter, so Odysseus thought he would see whether Eumaios,\n    in the excellent care he took of him, would take off his own cloak and give it\n    him, or make one of his men give him one. \"Listen to me,\" said he, \"Eumaios and\n    the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell you something. It is the\n    wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will make even a wise man fall to\n    singing; it will make him chuckle and dance and say many a word that he had\n    better leave unspoken; still, as I have begun, I will go on. Would that I were\n    still young and strong [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>] as when we got up an\n    ambuscade before <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>. Menelaos and\n    Odysseus were the leaders, but I was in command also, for the other two would\n    have it so. When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down\n    beneath our armor and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brush-wood\n    that grew about the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind blowing; the\n    snow fell small and fine like hoar frost, and our shields were coated thick\n    with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts, and slept comfortably\n    enough with their shields about their shoulders, but I had carelessly left my\n    cloak behind me, not thinking that I should be too cold, and had gone off in\n    nothing but my shirt and shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the\n    stars had shifted their places, I nudged Odysseus who was close to me with my\n    elbow, and he at once gave me his ear.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"486\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Odysseus,’ said I, ‘this cold will be the\n    death of me, for I have no cloak; some <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term>\n    fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my shirt, and I do not know what\n    to do.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"490"},{"n":"490","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"490\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Odysseus, who was as crafty as he was valiant,\n    hit upon the following plan [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>]:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"493\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Keep still,’ said he in a low voice, ‘or the\n    others will hear you.’ Then he raised his head on his elbow.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘My friends,’ said he, ‘I have had a dream\n    from heaven in my sleep.

But the swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs,\n    so he got ready to go and Odysseus was glad to see that he looked after his\n    property during his master's absence. First he slung his sword over his brawny\n    shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also took the skin\n    of a large and well fed goat, and a javelin in case of attack from men or dogs.\n    Thus equipped he went to his rest where the pigs were camping under an\n    overhanging rock that gave them shelter from the North wind. <milestone n=\"533\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
