[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.011820","title":"Iliad 2.761/ anchor comment on: the singular Muse of the Iliad and Odyssey","body":"<p>Unlike what we see at I.02.484, Ι.11.218, I.14.508, I.16.112, where the Muses are invoked as plural goddesses, the Muse here at I.02.761 is invoked as a singular goddess. And the Muse is of course singular also at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, I.01.001, and at the beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, O.01.001. There are also two other cases where a singular Muse is invoked:</p><p>A) In the First Song of Demodokos, O.08.73–82, which is featured as a proto-Iliad(see the comment at O.08.073-082), a singular Muse inspires the singer of tales at the beginning of his performance, at O.08.073. I think that the self-awareness at I.02.761 in invoking a singular Muse has to do with the singularity of the subject at I.02.760–770, since the subject in this case is Achilles. The Muse is asked for an answer to the Iliadic question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The answer of the Muse is that Achilles is the best. He is the singularity of the <em>Iliad </em>as epic, just as Odysseus is the singularity of the <em>Odyssey</em> as epic. That is why, I propose, the singular Muse here is the goddess Calliope. She is the perfect singularity of a Muse for these notionally singular heroes of two singularly important epics. After all, Calliope is the Muse of Epic. I refer here to my relevant arguments in <em><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4377\">Homer the Preclassic</a></em> E[pilegomena] §109 (p. 345) about Calliope as the Muse of kings (Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 79–93). Similarly, as I argue there, Orpheus was once the singular poet of kings, but his status was degraded in the Athenian phase of Homeric reception.</p><p>B) In the Third Song of Demodokos, O.08.499–533, when the singer of tales marks the beginning of his performance at O.08.499, the anonymous ‘divinity’ that he invokes at that point is a <em>theos</em>, in the singular. Short-term, this <em>theos</em> ‘divinity’ can be understood to be either Apollo or ‘the Muse’, as the disguised Odysseus himself remarks at O.08.488. Long-term, however, Apollo and the Muses are surrogates here for Zeus himself, who at O.13.025 is finally identified as the transcendent source of inspiration for the singing of Demodokos. The figuring of Zeus as such a transcendent source was traditionally considered to be a signature, as it were, of ‘Homer’ himself, as we read in the reference at Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3 to the <em>Homēridai</em>, a guild of singers from Chios who claimed, as ‘descendants of Homer’, to be the legitimate transmitters of ‘Homer’ as their poetic ancestor. An example of such a reference is the wording at the very beginning of Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3: ὅθεν περ καὶ Ὁμηρίδαι | ῥαπτῶν ἐπέων τὰ πόλλ᾿ ἀοιδοί | ἄρχονται, Διὸς ἐκ προοιμίου ‘(starting) from the point where [<em>hothen</em>] the <em>Homēridai</em>, singers, most of the time [<em>ta polla</em>] begin [<em>arkhesthai</em>] their stitched-together words, from the prelude [<em>prooimion</em>] of Zeus …’.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.761","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.035541","title":"Iliad 2","body":"<p>  </p><p>The narrative of Rhapsody 2 now follows up on the dire consequences of the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon as narrated in Rhapsody 1. Achilles has already withdrawn from the war because of his anger. So, now that this greatest hero of the Achaeans is out of the picture, what will happen next? How will the absence of Achilles affect the story of the Trojan War? Many new doubts and fears set in, and the resolve of the Achaeans is harshly tested. There is negative talk, and there are omens. Thus the story of the Trojan War, as told and retold countless times in the distant past, must now be retold yet again, and Rhapsody 2 will set the terms for the retelling still to come. For setting the terms, Rhapsody 2 will need a new Catalogue of Ships, now happening in the tenth year of the war, as a replacement for any old Catalogue that would have logically happened already in the first year. This new Catalogue is of course not really new: rather, it is the oldest possible Catalogue that is now being renewed for the newest possible retelling of the Trojan War, reconsidered in the glaring light of the grim consequences facing the Achaeans now that Achilles has withdrawn from the war. With these consequences in view, the Catalogue will reassess all the Achaean heroes involved in the Trojan War. Of special interest will be the role of Protesilaos, who had been the first Achaean to die in the war, as a model for Achilles. As the Master Narrator notes most ruefully, Protesilaos is now terribly missed by his fellow warriors.

Whereas the true Will of Zeus is the real plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, as noted in the comments on I.01.005 and on I.01.558–559, the false Will of Zeus is a false plot for the epic, since the eventual victory of the Achaeans over the Trojans in the tenth year of the Trojan War will not be quick and easy and painless but prolonged and difficult and painful. In the real plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, the Achaeans will suffer a new pain: they will find themselves on the losing side of the Trojan War while the Trojans will now be on the winning side. This temporary reversal in the tenth year of the Trojan War goes back to the moment when Agamemnon damages the tīmē ‘honor’ of Achilles. Because this damage was tolerated by the Achaeans, they will suffer—and keep on suffering—the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of being on the losing side until the fire of Hector finally reaches the ships of the Achaeans at the climax of the Battle for the Ships. By way of this reversal, through the Will of Zeus, Achilles will recover the <em>tīmē</em> or ‘honor’ that he had lost. At I.02.003-004, Zeus is shown in the act of planning this reversal: it is the Will of Zeus that he will give <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ to Achilles, and this honor, it is said here, will require the destruction of many warriors at the Battle for the Ships. Such destruction will be a source of great grief for the Achaeans. For them, victory at Troy will now become a most prolonged and difficult and painful goal to achieve. Such is the real plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, whereas the false plot that tells of a quick and easy and painless victory is only a dream. Nevertheless, the dream of this false plot is still a part of the real plot, since the Will of Zeus subsumes the false plot. The dream, then, is a subplot. After all, it is the <em>boulē</em> ‘will’ of Zeus to send the dream at I.02.005, and this <em>boulē</em> is here described as the ‘best’ <em>boulē</em> in the sense of a ‘best plan’ for now. The plan of Zeus here is a subplot that is the best of all possible subplots because it is part of the overarching plot of the Iliad, a master epic that subsumes all of its various subplots.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.1-2.6","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"False Dream"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Will of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"plot of the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"narrative arc"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sub-plot"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"tīmē ‘honor’ of Achilles"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Battle for the Ships"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"fire of Hector"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"boulē 'wish,plan'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.035675","title":"Iliad 2.3-2.5","body":"<p>Achilles’ prayer specifically entailing that Trojans should prevail until they reach the ships of the Achaeans</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.3-2.5","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.035746","title":"Iliad 2.7-15","body":"<p>The False Dream, personified, is instructed by Zeus to tell Agamemnon that the victory of the Achaeans over the Trojans will be quick and easy and painless, since the goddess Hērā at a council of the divinities has supposedly persuaded the other gods to acquiesce to such a victory. The instructions of Zeus as formulated at I.02.011–015 are carried out by the False Dream, who delivers the formulation to the sleeping Agamemnon at I.02.028–032. Later on, Agamemnon retells this formulation at I.02.065–69. I note that Zeus does not instruct the False Dream to say that these instructions are the Will of Zeus, though the wording of the False Dream implies it. The implication happens in an additional verse that follows the False Dream’s formulation as the messenger of Zeus at I.02.028–032. In this additional verse, at I.02.033, the False Dream says that the ultimate doom of the Trojans will be caused by Zeus.

But there is no such corresponding addition after the verses containing the original formulation of Zeus at I.02.011–015. In any case, what results from the formulation delivered by the False Dream as messenger of Zeus is that Agamemnon will misunderstand what the god really wants. Agamemnon will think that victory over the Trojans will now be quick and easy and painless. But Zeus plans instead just the opposite: in order to restore the <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ of Achilles, Zeus will make sure that the struggles awaiting the Achaeans will be prolonged and difficult and painful, so that the Achaeans will now be on the losing side until the fire of Hector finally reaches the ships of the Achaeans at the Battle for the Ships.

Nevertheless, Menelaos does manage to attend, arriving as the seventh hero, without having been invited to the sacrifice, I.02.408–409: rather, he comes automatos, which is conventionally interpreted to mean ‘of his own accord’, or, to put it into popular idiom, ‘automatically’, I.02.408.

The ability of Menelaos to read the mind of Agamemnon indicates a special meaning for the adjective <em>automatos</em> here. On the one hand, if Menelaos comes to the feast ‘on his own’, then we can expect his mind to be ‘operating by itself’—which is the meaning built into <em>automatos</em> as a compounding of the element <em>auto</em>- ‘self’ with the element <em>ma-t-</em>, derived from the root *<em>men-</em>/*<em>mn-</em> meaning ‘mind’. So, Menelaos has a mind of his own. On the other hand, something unexpected is going on here: this mind of Menelaos, exceptionally, can read the mind of the brother, and so <em>automatos</em> in this context means not only ‘having a mind of his own’ but also ‘having the same mind’ as the brother has. In terms of this interpretation, Agamemnon and Menelaos have the same mind because they share their own selves with each other. We can find mythological patterns of twin-like behavior in Homeric descriptions of Agamemnon and Menelaos, and these patterns affect even their thinking. See Frame 2009:177, with a further reference at pp. 72–73 n. 156. More from Frame pp. 209–215: Also, Menelaos in the <em>Iliad</em> consistently fails to take the initiative whenever he undertakes an activity together with his brother. In such situations, Menelaos is recessive in his twinned thinking, while Agamemnon is dominant.</p><p>Point 2. There is an allusion in Plato <em>Symposium</em> 174b-d to the wording here in I.02.408. And, on the basis of Athenaeus 1.8a, we can reconstruct a relevant proverb, to which Plato’s text is also alluding. This proverb can be reconstructed as αὐτόματοι δ’ ἀγαθοὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασι ‘automatically do the noble go to the feasts of the noble’. In such a context, I add, not only does each noble person have ‘a mind of his own’: that mind is also the ‘same’ mind that the other noble persons have. The point is, ‘like-minded’ or ‘same-minded’ people congregate with each other automatically at dinners.   </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.408","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"dominant and recessive twins"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"automatos 'having a mind of his own'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042188","title":"Iliad 2.409","body":"<p>reference to report of Demetrius’ negative judgment of ethos reflected in this line in Athenaeus 5.4 Kaibel (177ef)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.409","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042267","title":"Iliad 2.410","body":"<p>comparison with I.19.100, a non-formulaic attestation of eukhesthai introducing speech (formal parallelism between a sacral (I.02.410) and secular (I.19.100) eukhesthai formulas)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.410","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042320","title":"Iliad 2.411","body":"<p>comparison with I.19.100, a non-formulaic attestation of eukhesthai introducing speech (formal parallelism between a sacral (I.02.410) and secular (I.19.100) eukhesthai formulas)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.411","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042370","title":"Iliad 2.419","body":"<p>in a list of examples of directly quoted prayers not concluded by formula (A)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.419","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042459","title":"Iliad 2.421","body":"<p>in a list of examples of absolute usage of eukhesthai to report prayers (ritual narrative formulas)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.421","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042514","title":"Iliad 2.431","body":"<p>comment on the idea of division in dais (daitos eisēs)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.431","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"[dais 'feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice']"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042571","title":"Iliad 2.484-2.487","body":"<p>The immediacy of the Master Narrator’s performance here is counterbalanced by an attitude of remoteness from the composition.

Such rhyming is rare and archaizing. (On archaic patterns of rhyming in early Greek poetry, see Nagy 1974:99–101.) Of special interest here is the invocation of the Muses in the plural, to be contrasted with the invocation of the Muse in the singular at I.01.001. See the comment on I.02.761. On the poetics of re-invocation here, there will be more to say in the comments on I.02.761, Ι.11.218, I.14.508, I.16.112. For now, it suffices to observe that the re-invocation of the Muses here at I.02.484 pictures these goddesses in the plural, by contrast with the singular Muse who had been initially invoked at I.01.001. There will be another invocation of the singular Muse at I.02.761, to be followed by invocations of plural Muses at Ι.11.218, I.14.508, and I.16.112. In the case of each invocation, there is a heightened level of poetic self-awareness about the importance of what is about to be narrated. Here at I.02.484, for example, the Master Narrator shows his concern about the need for accuracy in re-creating a comprehensive catalogue of essentially all the cultural ancestors of the Greek-speaking world. On other occasions of re-invocation, there will be comparable poetic concerns, as we will see in comments still to come. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.484","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"re-invocation of Muse(s)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ennepein 'narrate, tell'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Mousa 'Muse'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"singing as narrating"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042714","title":"Iliad 2.484","body":"<p>analysis of the variant prologue to the Iliad connecting the mēnis of Achilles and of Apollo and its identical line to I.02.484</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.484","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042775","title":"Iliad 2.486","body":"<p>Homeric epic referring to itself as kleos, like Pindar’s medium</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.486","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.042828","title":"Iliad 2.486","body":"<p>The ‘I’ of Homer is interchangeable with ‘we’.

An aristocratic woman, she was taken captive by Achilles when he conquered the city of Lyrnessos and killed her husband Mynes, who was defending that city, I.02.690–691. The story about the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and about his capturing of Briseis stemmed from poetic traditions that were distinctly Aeolian in origin. And this Aeolian origin has to do with a most basic fact about the principal hero of the <em>Iliad</em>: <em>Achilles himself was an Aeolian, and he originated from a poetic tradition that was Aeolian</em>. Achilles was an Aeolian not only in the limited sense that he was born and raised in Aeolian Thessaly, to the west of the Aegean Sea: much more than that, the poetic traditions about this hero’s conquests of territories to the east of the Aegean, across the sea from Thessaly, shaped his identity as a prime hero not only for the Thessalians in the European mainland but also for all Aeolians, including the Aeolic-speaking populations that inhabited the coastal mainland of northern Asia Minor and the outlying islands of Lesbos and Tenedos. As we will see in the course of further analysis, it was the myths about the conquests of Achilles in the East, including the regions of Troy and beyond, that shaped the ultimately Aeolian identity of the Aeolic-speaking populations that inhabited those eastern regions—which as I noted in the anchor comment at I.01.463 included the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos as well as the coastal mainland of most of northern Asia Minor. The conquests of Achilles in that whole area can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologized a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” by Aeolians from Thessaly. (See Nagy 2011b:171–173.) It is in this light that we may view the hero’s conquest of Lyrnessos, which was a city located in the region of Troy, south of Mount Ida. For more details about the location of Lyrnessos, see the comment on I.20.089–102. The conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles was part of the myths conveyed by Aeolian poetic traditions, and that is how the captive woman Briseis becomes part of that tradition. In other words, Briseis is figured as an Aeolian because she is appropriated by the Aeolian poetic tradition. Likewise, as we see at I.02.691 here, Achilles conquered not only the city of Lyrnessos but also the city of Thēbē. This parallelism of Lyrnessos and Thēbē is most significant, as we will now see. Thēbē was originally not an Aeolian city, and the non-Aeolian identity of Thēbē is accentuated by way of a detail: as we read at I.06.397 and at I.06.415, the inhabitants of Thēbē before its destruction by Achilles had been non-Greek <em>Kilikes</em> ‘Cilicians’. And there is a striking parallelism here between Thēbē and Lyrnessos: the same non-Greek population had reportedly inhabited Lyrnessos as well. We read in Strabo 13.1.7 C586 that the region of the <em>Kilikes</em> was evenly divided between the cities of Thēbē and Lyrnessos. Nevertheless, as in the case of Lyrnessos, the poetic tradition about the conquest of Thēbē by Achilles was Aeolian. And when Achilles conquered the city of Thēbē, as we see at I.01.366–369, he captured there an aristocratic woman named Chryseis. So, as in the case of Briseis, Chryseis too becomes an Aeolian by virtue of being appropriated by the Aeolian poetic tradition about the conquests of the Aeolian hero Achilles. In the case of Chryseis, she was allotted by the Achaeans to Agamemnon as his very own war-prize, Ι.01.369, while Briseis had been allotted to Achilles, Ι.01.392. (For background on the Aeolian poetic traditions about Briseis and Chryseis, I strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography.) And now we come to a third aristocratic woman who is likewise identified by way of parallel Aeolian connections: she is Andromache, wife of Hector. Just as Achilles captured the women Chryseis and Briseis when he conquered the cities of Thēbē and Lyrnessos respectively, so too Achilles would have captured Andromache at the same time—if she had not been already married off to Hector, who had brought her as his bride to Troy before the Achaeans ever even arrived at Troy. Andromache originated from the city of Thēbē, as we see at I.06.394–396, and we have already seen at I.01.366–369 that Thēbē was the place where Achilles captured Chryseis when he conquered that city. The father of Andromache, Eëtion, was the king of the <em>Kilikes</em> who had inhabited the city of Thēbē, I.06.395–398, and he was killed by Achilles when that hero conquered this city, I.06.416–420. There is an important parallel noted by Strabo 13.1.7 C586 (also 13.1.61 C611–612): the husband of Briseis, Mynes, was evidently the king of the other <em>Kilikes</em> who had inhabited the city of Lyrnessos; Strabo draws attention to this parallelism in the context of citing I.02.691 and I.19.295, both of which verses refer to the time when Achilles conquered Lyrnessos and killed Mynes. In sum, all three of the women who are highlighted in these Iliadic contexts—Chryseis, Briseis, and Andromache—were appropriated by the Aeolian poetic traditions about the conquests of Achilles the Aeolian. And such Aeolian poetic traditions of songmaking are directly attested in Song 44 of Sappho about the wedding of Hector and Andromache. The songs attributed to Sappho as also to Alcaeus, both of whom are dated around 600 BCE, originate from the Aeolian island of Lesbos. There will be more to say about these traditions in the anchor comment at I.09.128–131 / 270–272 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 2.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:2.689-2.694","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Briseis the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Chryseis the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"conquest of Thēbē by Achilles the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Andromache the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"songmaking of Sappho/Alcaeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.048481","title":"Iliad 2.689-2.694","body":"<p>The Iliad refers to a variety of epic deeds performed by Achilles, and the relative chronology of these deeds is in many cases situated before or after the time-frame of the <em>Iliad</em> as we know it.

Even in the two exceptional cases where Homeric poetry refers to any of these locations, what gets highlighted is merely the place, not the status of that place as a city-state or, when it comes to Chios and Samos, as an island-state. In one of these two exceptional cases, the mention of Chios at Ο.03.170 and at O.03.172 refers not to the famous island-state that Chios eventually became but simply to the island.
