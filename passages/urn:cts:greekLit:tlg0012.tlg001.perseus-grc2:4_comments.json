Besides the surface meaning, ‘attendant’, we can see here some traces of the deeper meaning, ‘ritual substitute’. In Iliadic battle scenes, a chariot driver sometimes “takes the hit,” as it were, for the chariot fighter who ordinarily rides with him on the platform of the war chariot. In “taking the hit,” the chariot driver could die for the chariot fighter, and, in this role, the chariot driver is sometimes described as a <em>therapōn</em> of the chariot fighter. Thus the chariot driver becomes the ‘ritual substitute’ as well as ‘attendant’ of the chariot fighter. Also relevant is the word <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’, the first occcurrence of which in the <em>Iliad</em> is at I.05.231. See Nagy 2015.05.01, 2015.05.08, 2015.05.15, 2015.05.20. Such is the relationship between Achilles as chariot fighter and Patroklos as his premier chariot driver and <em>therapōn</em> in the dual sense of ‘ritual substitute’ and ‘attendant’: see H24H 6§§24–42. In the present context, we see that the hero Eurymedon, named at I.04.228, is described at I.04.227 as the <em>therapōn</em> of Agamemnon. Eurymedon is at this moment taking care of the horse team and chariot of Agamemnon while the king leaves him behind and goes off ‘on foot’, <em>pezos</em>, at I.04.231, in order to harangue the troops. Evidently, Eurymedon is pictured here as the chariot driver of Agamemnon, who is of course the chariot fighter and who has just stepped off his chariot. Potentially, then, Eurymedon as <em>therapōn</em> of Agamemnon is also his ritual substitute. The name Eurymedon recurs at I.08.114, where he is paired with Sthenelos, the chariot driver of Diomedes: the two of them are seen in the act of taking the disabled chariot and horse team of Nestor back to a zone of safety, I.08.116–117. In the act of taking care of Nestor’s horse team, both Sthenelos and Eurymedon are described at I.08.113—and already at I.08.109—as <em>theraponte</em>, which is of course <em>therapōn</em> in the dual. Evidently, Eurymedon is visualized as the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’ of Nestor already at I.08.113, and the context there shows that he is also the designated chariot driver of Nestor: see the comment on Ι.08.076–117. Later on, at I.11.620, Eurymedon is explicitly called the therapōn of Nestor, functioning as the ‘attendant’ of the old hero: at this moment, Eurymedon is taking care of the horse team of Patroklos, who has just driven his chariot to the headquarters of Nestor as the old hero’s guest, I.11.618–622.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.227","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"taking the hit\""},{"description":"","image":"","name":"therapōn 'attendant, ritual substitute'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Eurymedon"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Sthenelos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Patroklos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"chariot driver/fighter"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054046","title":"Iliad 4.241","body":"<p>The verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ here again marks the language of blame as opposed to the language of praise. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.241","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikeîn ‘quarrel with’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"language of praise/blame"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054095","title":"Iliad 2.242","body":"<p>The objects of blame here are those who hesitate in battle, described as <em>elenkhees</em>, plural of the adjective <em>elenkhēs</em> ‘disgraceful’, which is a derivative of the noun <em>elenkhos</em> ‘disgrace’, on which see also I.02.235.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.242","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"language of praise/blame"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"elenkhos ‘disgrace’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054141","title":"Iliad 4.291","body":"<p>citation of formulaic use of haloûsá te perthoménē te as example where halṓō means “to be seized” in Homer</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.291","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054206","title":"Iliad 4.295","body":"<p>analysis of the names of Neleus’ sons in the Iliad and Hesiod</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.295","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054253","title":"Iliad 4.295","body":"<p>analysis of the names of Neleus’ sons in the Iliad and Hesiod</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.295","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054299","title":"Iliad 4.308-4.309","body":"<p>analysis of Nestor’s association with noos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.308-4.309","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054349","title":"Iliad 4.313-314","body":"<p>The expression of admiration here is amplified by way of a wish.

The over-king’s language of blame here is meant to diminish the epic reputation of Diomedes and his chariot-driver Sthenelos, who were prominent heroes in the Theban Wars epic tradition of the past before they became heroes also in the Trojan Wars epic tradition of the present. Diomedes and Sthenelos were main characters in the epic tradition known as the <em>Sons of the Seven against Thebes</em>, or <em>Epigonoi</em>, while their fathers Tydeus and Kapaneus were the main characters in the earlier epic tradition known as the <em>Seven against Thebes</em>. In terms of the blame directed at Diomedes and Sthenelos by Agamemnon, the fathers must have been better than the sons. But the rejoinder of Sthenelos at I.04.404–410 make an opposite claim: the sons were really better than the fathers, since they succeeded in capturing Thebes, whereas the fathers failed. These epic themes are comparable to the Hesiodic reference at <em>Works and Days</em> 156–173 to both the Theban and the Trojan Wars: here too, the burning question is whether a given generation of heroes in the present is superior or inferior to the immediately preceding generation of heroes in the past.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.367-4.410","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikeîn ‘quarrel with’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"language of praise/blame"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054611","title":"Iliad 4.370-4.400","body":"<p>analysis of the foreshadowing of Diomedes’ role in the second segment of the poem</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:4.370-4.400","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.054674","title":"Iliad 4.386","body":"<p>The periphrasis of the name <em>Eteokléēs</em> here as <em>bíē Eteoklēeíē</em> is comparable to the periphrasis of the name <em>Hērakléēs</em> as <em>biē Hēraklēeíē</em>.
