But do thou set before her fair entertainment, while I put aside my bellows and all my tools.\n    </quote>\n    <milestone n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>He spake, and from the anvil rose, a huge, panting<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">319.2</note> bulk, halting the while, but beneath him his slender legs moved nimbly. The bellows he set away from the fire, and gathered all the tools wherewith he wrought into a silver chest; and with a sponge wiped he his face and his two hands withal,<milestone n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>and his mighty neck and shaggy breast, and put upon him a tunic, and grasped a stout staff, and went forth halting; but there moved swiftly to support their lord handmaidens wrought of gold in the semblance of living maids. In them is understanding in their hearts, and in them speech<milestone n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>and strength, and they know cunning handiwork by gift of the immortal gods. These busily moved to support their lord, and he, limping nigh to where Thetis was, sat him down upon a shining chair; and he clasped her by the hand, and spake, and addressed her:\n    <quote>Wherefore, long-robed Thetis, art thou come to our house,<milestone n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>an honoured guest and a welcome? Heretofore thou hast not been wont to come.

Of all the daughters of the sea he subdued me alone to a mortal, even to Peleus, son of Aeacus, and I endured the bed of a mortal albeit sore against my will. And lo, he lieth<milestone n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>in his halls fordone with grievous old age, but now other griefs are mine. A son he gave me to bear and to rear, pre-eminent among warriors, and he shot up like a sapling; then when I had reared him as a tree in a rich orchard plot, I sent him forth in the beaked ships to Ilios<milestone n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>to war with the Trojans; but never again shall I welcome him back to his home, to the house of Peleus. And while yet he liveth, and beholdeth the light of the sun, he hath sorrow, nor can I any wise help him, though I go to him. The girl that the sons of the Achaeans chose out for him as a prize,<milestone n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>her hath the lord Agamemnon taken back from out his arms. Verily in grief for her was he wasting his heart; but the Achaeans were the Trojans penning at the sterns of the ships, and would not suffer them to go forth. And to him the elders of the Argives made prayer, and named many glorious gifts.<milestone n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>Then albeit he refused himself to ward from them ruin, yet clad he Patroclus in his own armour and sent him into the war, and added therewithal much people. All day long they fought around the Scaean gates, and on that selfsame day had laid the city waste, but that,<milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>after the valiant son of Menoetius had wrought sore harm, Apollo slew him amid the foremost fighters and gave glory to Hector. Therefore am I now come to thy knees, if so be thou wilt be minded to give my son, that is doomed to a speedy death, shield and helmet, and goodly greaves fitted with ankle-pieces,<milestone n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>and corselet.

And on the fire he put stubborn bronze and tin<milestone n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>and precious gold and silver; and thereafter he set on the anvil-block a great anvil, and took in one hand a massive hammer, and in the other took he the tongs.\n    First fashioned he a shield, great and sturdy, adorning it cunningly in every part, and round about it set a bright rim,<milestone n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>threefold and glittering, and therefrom made fast a silver baldric. Five were the layers of the shield itself; and on it he wrought many curious devices with cunning skill.\n    Therein he wrought the earth, therein the heavens therein the sea, and the unwearied sun, and the moon at the full,<milestone n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>and therein all the constellations wherewith heaven is crowned—the Pleiades, and the Hyades and the mighty Orion, and the Bear, that men call also the Wain, that circleth ever in her place, and watcheth Orion, and alone hath no part in the baths of Ocean.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"490"},{"n":"490","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"490\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>Therein fashioned he also two cities of mortal men exceeding fair. In the one there were marriages and feastings, and by the light of the blazing torches they were leading the brides from their bowers through the city, and loud rose the bridal song. And young men were whirling in the dance, and in their midst<milestone n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>flutes and lyres sounded continually; and there the women stood each before her door and marvelled. But the folk were gathered in the place of assembly; for there a strife had arisen, and two men were striving about the blood-price of a man slain; the one avowed that he had paid all,<milestone n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>declaring his cause to the people, but the other refused to accept aught;<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">325.1</note> and each was fain to win the issue on the word of a daysman. Moreover, the folk were cheering both, shewing favour to this side and to that. And heralds held back the folk, and the elders were sitting upon polished stones in the sacred circle,<milestone n=\"505\" unit=\"line\"/>holding in their hands the staves of the loud-voiced heralds. Therewith then would they spring up and give judgment, each in turn. And in the midst lay two talents of gold, to be given to him whoso among them should utter the most righteous judgment.\n    But around the other city lay in leaguer two hosts of warriors<milestone n=\"510\" unit=\"line\"/>gleaming in armour. And twofold plans found favour with them, either to lay waste the town or to divide in portions twain all the substance that the lovely city contained within.<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">327.1</note> Howbeit the besieged would nowise hearken thereto, but were arming to meet the foe in an ambush. The wall were their dear wives and little children guarding,<milestone n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>as they stood thereon, and therewithal the men that were holden of old age; but the rest were faring forth, led of Ares and Pallas Athene, both fashioned in gold, and of gold was the raiment wherewith they were clad. Goodly were they and tall in their harness, as beseemeth gods, clear to view amid the rest, and the folk at their feet were smaller.<milestone n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they were come to the place where it seemed good unto them to set their ambush, in a river-bed where was a watering-place for all herds alike, there they sate them down, clothed about with flaming bronze. Thereafter were two scouts set by them apart from the host, waiting till they should have sight of the sheep and sleek cattle.<milestone n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>And these came presently, and two herdsmen followed with them playing upon pipes; and of the guile wist they not at all.\n\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"527"},{"n":"527","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"527\">\n    <p>But the liers-in-wait, when they saw these coming on, rushed forth against them and speedily cut off the herds of cattle and fair flocks of white-fleeced sheep, and slew the herdsmen withal.<milestone n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>But the besiegers, as they sat before the places of gathering<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">329.1</note> and heard much tumult among the kine, mounted forthwith behind their high-stepping horses, and set out thitherward, and speedily came upon them.

Even as living mortals joined they in the fray and fought;<milestone n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>and they were haling away each the bodies of the others' slain.\n    Therein he set also soft fallow-land, rich tilth and wide, that was three times ploughed; and ploughers full many therein were wheeling their yokes and driving them this way and that. And whensoever after turning they came to the headland of the field,<milestone n=\"545\" unit=\"line\"/>then would a man come forth to each and give into his hands a cup of honey-sweet wine; and the ploughmen would turn them in the furrows, eager to reach the headland of the deep tilth. And the field grew black behind and seemed verily as it had been ploughed, for all that it was of gold; herein was the great marvel of the work.\n    <milestone n=\"550\" unit=\"line\"/>Therein he set also a king's demesne-land, wherein labourers were reaping, bearing sharp sickles in their hands. Some handfuls were falling in rows to the ground along the swathe, while others the binders of sheaves were binding with twisted ropes of straw. Three binders stood hard by them, while behind them<milestone n=\"555\" unit=\"line\"/>boys would gather the handfuls, and bearing them in their arms would busily give them to the binders; and among them the king, staff in hand, was standing in silence at the swathe, joying in his heart. And heralds apart beneath an oak were making ready a feast, and were dressing a great ox they had slain for sacrifice; and the women<milestone n=\"560\" unit=\"line\"/>sprinkled the flesh with white barley in abundance, for the workers' mid-day meal.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"561"},{"n":"561","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"561\">\n    <p>\n    Therein he set also a vineyard heavily laden with clusters, a vineyard fair and wrought of gold; black were the grapes, and the vines were set up throughout on silver poles.

And maidens and youths in childish glee were bearing the honey-sweet fruit in wicker baskets. And in their midst a boy made pleasant music with a clear-toned lyre,<milestone n=\"570\" unit=\"line\"/>and thereto sang sweetly the Linos-song<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">331.1</note> with his delicate voice; and his fellows beating the earth in unison therewith followed on with bounding feet mid dance and shoutings.\n    And therein he wrought a herd of straight-horned kine: the kine were fashioned of gold and tin,<milestone n=\"575\" unit=\"line\"/>and with lowing hasted they forth from byre to pasture beside the sounding river, beside the waving reed. And golden were the herdsmen that walked beside the kine, four in number, and nine dogs swift of foot followed after them. But two dread lions amid the foremost kine<milestone n=\"580\" unit=\"line\"/>were holding a loud-lowing bull, and he, bellowing mightily, was haled of them, while after him pursued the dogs and young men.

There were youths dancing and maidens of the price of many cattle, holding their hands upon the wrists one of the other.<milestone n=\"595\" unit=\"line\"/>Of these the maidens were clad in fine linen, while the youths wore well-woven tunics faintly glistening with oil; and the maidens had fair chaplets, and the youths had daggers of gold hanging from silver baldrics.
