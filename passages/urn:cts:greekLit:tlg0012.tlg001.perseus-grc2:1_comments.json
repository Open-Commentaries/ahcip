It consists of the accusative of the noun <em>mênis</em> (μῆνιν, usually translated as &#x27;rage, wrath, anger&#x27;) at the beginning of the line followed by a subjective genitive name (of the person whom the <em>mênis </em>inhabits) with epithets that concludes the line, as in <em>Iliad</em> 1.75, 5.444, 16.711, 19.75 (in the last attestation, the grammatical pattern is the same except that the genitive is not subjective or objective); another multiform of this syntactic pattern occurs in <em>Iliad </em>19.35, where a dative of the <em>object</em> of the anger (Agamemnon) occurs whereas a subjective genitive is found in the other examples. Either epithets for the name or a verb governing the accusative fill up the space between line-initial μῆνιν and the name + epithet combinations at the end of the line; the current line is the only example we have in which an imperative verb and a term of address, θεά, occur in that space, but then again, this is the <em>prooimion</em> of the poem, not the narrative proper. One expects variation in traditional dictional patterns when the context varies, and in this case the variation pertains exactly to the conventional content of this context. One can also say that the traditional diction <em>points at</em> or <em>highlights</em> a conventional narrative usage by placing it in an extra-narrative context.</p><p>Like every word in the epic song-generating system, <em>mênin</em>, the first word of the poem has expressive dimensions that were disclosed to its original audiences and performers through age-old, recurrent exposure to this poetry in performance. Those dimensions are invisible to us — unless we strive to rebuild them from the existing corpus of Homeric poetry. So this word  means potentially more and potentially different things than the English words “rage” or “anger” with which it is usually translated. A contextual analysis that this commentary will track over the course of the poem supports one point that we anticipate here. <em>mēnis </em>is a keyword of a &#x27;theme&#x27; or relatively formalized, larger unit of traditional content (for a working definition of the term ‘theme’ in the study of traditional poetry, see Lord 2000: ch. 4). That theme recurs within a more or less consistent set of episodes and diction elsewhere in the Homeric corpus, so its occurrence evokes a set of narratives that have a discernible pattern or patterns. We will signal the details of the patterns and their recurring diction as they reach the reader’s eyes. However, we signal now that a most illuminating instance of the <em>mênis</em> theme, which would make good reading <em>before</em> reading or re-reading the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, occurs at <em>Iliad</em> 15.1-142.</p><p>References</p><p>Lord, A. 1960, 2nd ed. 2000. <em>The Singer of Tales</em>.

The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. The word is <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, I.01.001, and it refers to the anger of Achilles. A definitive book on this word is Muellner 1996. The Master Narrator begins his narration by focusing on this anger: he calls on a Muse, whom he addresses simply as <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’, to sing this anger, I.01.001. The subject of this narration, the anger of Achilles, is the grammatical object of the verb aeidein ‘sing’. So, the <em>narrative subject</em> is the <em>grammatical object</em>. The Master Narrator is calling on the Muse to sing the anger, not just sing about the anger. The song is not only about the anger: it is the anger itself. The song captures the total reality of the anger. The Master Narrator proceeds to tell about this anger: it happened because of a quarrel, as signaled especially by the words <em>erizein</em> ‘have strife’ at I.01.006 and <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at I.01.008. This quarrel in the <em>Iliad</em> is parallel to another quarrel that is narrated in a “micro-Iliad” that we find embedded in the <em>Odyssey</em>. This micro-Iliad is the First Song of Demodokos, O<em>.</em>08.072–083, and the quarrel there is signaled especially by the word <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075. It has been debated whether the quarrel scene in this “micro-Iliad” was modeled on a quarrel-scene in the <em>Cypria</em>, which was part of the epic Cycle. On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. But the quarrel scenes of the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Cypria</em>, and the “micro-Iliad” can be seen as stemming from epic traditions that were originally independent of each other. On the term <em>epic</em>, used here for the first time in these comments on the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, see again the Inventory of terms and names.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.1-1.12","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"narrative subject as grammatical object"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aeidein 'sing'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"erizein 'have strife'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eris 'strife'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"micro-Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"First Song of Demodokos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikos 'quarrel'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Master Narrator"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Cypria"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic Cycle"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Muse as goddess of poetic inspiration"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mēnis ‘anger’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.012354","title":"Iliad 1.1-2","body":"<p>The <em>mēnis</em> of Achilles is a special kind of ‘anger’.

Both practices, exposition and cremation, are linked with ideas of eschatology, that is, of a permanent kind of afterlife. In Zoroastrian traditions, such an afterlife is endangered by cremation, while in Homeric traditions the danger comes from exposition. There will be more to say about ideas of afterlife in the anchor comment at I.23.071–076, where it will be argued that Hādēs in Homeric poetry is merely a transitional phase of afterlife for the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of a hero who died: in other words, Hādēs is not eschatological. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.3-1.5","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hādēs"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"autos 'self'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sōma ‘body’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"exposition of the dead body to dogs and birds"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"cremation"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eschatology"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē 'spirit'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.012809","title":"Iliad 1.005","body":"<p>The Will of Zeus is presented here as the plot of the narration or narrative arc that we know as the <em>Iliad</em>.

For example one part of the sphere of Apollo is both the causing and the healing of <em>loimos</em> &#x27;plague&#x27;. By contrast, in the warrior domain, <em>tīmē</em> means an individual&#x27;s social prestige within the group. This differentiation in meaning is because of the division of labor that obtains among the divinities and of the <em>absence</em> of the division of labor among the heroes — or, to put it another way, to the fact that all members of the warrior class in theory at least compete for excellence in the same set of spheres, which are the ones that are divided up into specializations among the gods. So the same term,  <em>timē</em>, can mean general prestige for humans and specific prerogatives for gods. The gods do not conflict with one another except when the boundaries between their <em>prerogatives</em> are not respected, whereas the heroes conflict with each when their <em>prestige</em> as warriors is not respected.</p><p>On the other hand, the old man Chryses, unlike the warriors, is a human being <em>with a sphere or prerogative</em> that is specified along with the fact that he has been slighted. In other words, what Agamemnon has done is to slight his prerogative as a person who prays/curses, not his general prestige in the specialized domain of warriors. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.11","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"tīmē"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mēnis"}],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.013372","title":"Iliad 1.13-15","body":"<p>Chrysēs came to the ships to engage in an exchange, a behavior that the anthropologist/sociologist Marcel Mauss described as the basic form of social contract in archaic societies. Archaic exchange systems, he said, are \"total social phenomena\", in that they seamlessly interweave <em>economic</em>, <em>sacral</em>, and <em>social </em>or<em> group</em> interaction. That is exactly what we see here: the intention to exchange involves Chrysēs with the whole social group (l. 15, πάντας Ἀχαιούς, 'all Achaeans'), it requires of him the transfer of wealth —the verb φέρω 'carry, bear' (l. 13) designates the movement of prestige goods that cannot move by themselves—, and it is accompanied by the display of sacred symbols referred to the god Apollo, namely wreaths on a golden scepter (lines 14-15). </p><p>This attempt at exchange may look to us like the kind of economic transaction that only occurs between civilized people and criminals. It is customary to translate the word λυσόμενος in line 13 with the English word 'ransom', because for us, the exchange of human beings for goods is 'human trafficking,' which is by definition a heinous evil. Mauss also clarifies this problem, which is one of the most difficult aspects of an archaic exchange system for us to understand. In the world of Homeric epic, Mauss would say, humans are exchangeable for goods not because humans are commodified or objectified, but because <em>goods are humanized</em>, because they are as dear and as attached to human beings as human beings are to each other. Lacking a medium of exchange like coins or bills, which can dehumanize even prestige goods made by artists or skilled craftsmen, people in the Epic world not only identify themselves with what we call objects (as we sometimes do), they also do not categorically distinguish between people and things as property types. Instead, the regnant distinction is between immovable goods (those which cannot move themselves), like tripods or golden cups or woven goods, and movable ones (those which can move themselves), like cattle or human beings or slaves.</p><p>References</p><p>Mauss, Marcel. \"Essai sur le don: forme et raison de l'change dans les sociétés archaïques, <em>L'Année sociologique</em>, nouvelle série, I, 1923-1924 (<a href=\"http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/mauss_marcel/socio_et_anthropo/2_essai_sur_le_don/essai_sur_le_don.pdf\">http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/mauss_marcel/socio_et_anthropo/2_essai_sur_le_don/essai_sur_le_don.pdf</a>) translated into English by W.

There is a demonstrably living analogy between <em>poinē</em> and <i>apoina</i>, as one can see from the context of Iliad 9.632-637, which draws an explicit parallel between the two, so the use of a different verb, <em>helesthai, </em>in the instance of a negated <em>poinē,</em> reinforces the normality of the syntactic formula is <em>apoina</em> + forms of <em>dekhesthai</em> 'to accept'. </p><p>Payments designated as <em>apoina</em> in Homeric epic are customarily accepted. We can say that the traditional diction is equipped for that, and in archaic exchange systems as described by Mauss, there are symmetrical obligations: there is an obligation to accept an offer to exchange just as there is an obligation to reciprocate appropriately once one accepts an exchange. There are exceptions to those obligations, but they are fraught with danger and power for all concerned. One such exception is this one, the first scene in the Iliad, in which Agamemnon rejects the <em>apoina</em> of Chryses. For another example, we can point to Achilles fighting in the river Xanthos at the beginning of Iliad 21, when he comes upon the Trojan Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had not long before captured and 'sold' — the difference between 'selling' and giving <em>apoina</em> for a person is not to be pressed (see <em>peperēmenos </em>'having been sold' 21.58, 21.78 vs. 21.99 <em>apoina </em>for the same transaction as well as the extremely archaic expression <em>ōnon edōke</em> 'paid a price' at 21.41 for another transaction of the same type). Lycaon grabs Achilles by the knees in the posture of a suppliant, in other words, a person urgently requesting a customarily obligatory \"favor\". Yet Achilles tells him that his (Achilles') days of accepting payment for captives, which he did often before (21.100-102), have ended with the death of Patroklos, especially, he says, when it comes to the sons of Priam. Then, by way of consolation for both himself and Lycaon, Achilles goes on to describe the coming day of his own death, at dawn or midday or in the afternoon, by a spear or an arrow from a bowstring (21.106-113). Then he kills Lycaon, brutally, confronting us, too, with the moment of death for a person who has just come to life for us in the narrative. For a third example, there is Achilles' refusal of Agamemnon's <em>apoina</em> for him in Iliad 9, but as we shall see, there are significant anomalies in that failed transaction that are not present in this instance or in Achilles' refusal of Lycaon. A better parallel to the present moment is the legal dispute on Achilles' shield, which turns on the question, in what circumstances the refusal of a <em>poinē</em> could be proper — with the implication that there may or may not be such circumstances.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.20","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Syntactic formula"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"apoina"}],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.013801","title":"Iliad 1.22-1.23","body":"<p>The language precisely contrasts the response of 'all the other Achaeans' (<em>alloi...pantes...Akhaioi</em>, l. 22) with that of Agamemnon, 'but not to Agamemnon son of Atreus' (<em>all' ouk Atreidēi Agamemnon, </em>l. 24) to the offer of a 'limitless ransom' by the old man, Chryses. That Agamemnon's response paces him in a minority of one is another sign that the offer of payment is obligatory by custom and that its refusal is dangerous and powerful when viewed in the context of other offers of <em>apoina</em> 'payment' and their refusal/acceptance (see notes above on <em>Iliad</em> 1.13, 1.13-15, and 1.20; for a parallel to Agamemnon's isolated position here, see Odyssey 3.141-143). D. Elmer (2103, pp. 30-31 and chapter 3, pp. 63-85) argues that the diction describing the collective response of  all the Achaeans (<em>alloi...pantes epeuphēmēsan Akhaioi</em> 'all the other Achaeans shouted their approval', l. 22) is also exceptional, not the standard way of expressing communal opinion, as is the utter refusal of Agamemnon to hear and heed their response in rejecting the offer. Note also the semantic parallelism between the earlier expression 'he slighted the prestige of the one who prays/curses' (of Chryses, l. 11, previewing Agamemnon's reaction here), and the Achaeans request that he, by contrast, 'show the priest respect'  (<em>aideisthai hierēa</em>, l. 23). <em>Aidōs</em> (seen here in its denominative verb <em>aideisthai</em>) is another key term in the vocabulary of social value, where a person's <em>aidōs</em> 'respect' is a function of a figure's <em>timē</em> 'prestige, prerogative'. That is why he is again described in his social function as priest, just as he was described as 'the one who prays/curses' in the earlier formulation. In line 23, note again the parallelism and implied equivalence between engaging in exchange (<em>aglaa dekhthai apoina</em> 'to accept the splendid payment') and showing respect for the priest (<em>aideisthai </em><i>hierea</i>), because a person's value to the society is manifest in the way in which he or she participates in exchange.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Elmer, David. <em>The Poetics of Consent: Collective Decision Making in the</em> Iliad.

David Elmer (2013, p. 42-46) has shown that the verb 'to please' that is used here, <em>handanein</em>, is \"an essential component of the <em>Iliad</em>'s decision-making vocabulary\" (p. 44), in which it functions as \"a way of signaling divergence from an otherwise cohesive collective will (p. 42).\" He also argues that an authoritarian, individualistic preference overriding the collective will is <em>not</em> normative behavior in Homeric society, but its opposite. The norm in decision-making in the <em>Iliad</em> is for the collective will to be decisive (Elmer 2013, Chapter 1). Furthermore, Agamemnon's divergent response represents a failure to perceive the interwoven social and sacral consequences of his act. Agamemnon himself is not only the titular leader of the whole expedition to Troy on his brother's behalf, manifested in his possession of the epithet <em>anax andrōn </em>'lord of men' (an expression that is used of him 49 of the 54 times it occurs in the Homeric and Hesiodic poems), but he is also the wielder of the sacrificial knife (Hitch 2009, Chapter 4), to which we can compare the role of Chryses as the old man who prays/curses and who bears wreaths on a golden <em>skēptron</em> 'staff/sceptre' (1.14-15): we have discussed above the overt sacred/social aspects of the system of exchange: see the comments on <em>Iliad</em> 1.13-15.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Hitch, Sarah. 2009. <em>King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the</em> Iliad.

Here Agamemnon addresses Chryses; he κρατερὸν δ᾽ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε. Often this word is translated simply as <em>word</em> or <em>speech</em>. However, it is apparent in this line that <em>mûthos</em> is not just a speech but also an act that displays authority. On the one hand, <em>mûthos</em> is a performance of Agamemnon’s power over Chryses. On the other, it is a performance before the troops intended to persuade the audience that his action is appropriate. In general, the word <em>mûthos</em> is best understood as a speech-act which is performed in order to augment, diminish, or negotiate the status and power of speakers in the <em>Iliad</em>. In the <em>Iliad</em> all<em> muthoi</em> are performed at length, usually in public, and comprise a range of speech-genres. However, all but 12 of the 167 occurrences of the stem <span style=\"font-style: normal !msorm;\"><em>muth</em></span>- (noun and verb forms) in the <em>Iliad</em> can also be categorized as marking proposals and commands or threats and boasts. These discourses can be further categorized into three genres:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Commands (See Zeus’s command via Iris at <em>Iliad</em> 8.399-408)</li>\r\n<li>Boast-and-insult contests (see Agamemnon’s <em>epipolesis </em>in <em>Iliad</em> 4)</li>\r\n<li>The recitation of remembered events (see Nestor at <em>Iliad</em> 1.259-274)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Thus each hero in the <em>Iliad</em> is a performer who utilizes these genres in order to compete within Homeric society. <em>mûthos</em> then is an authoritative self-presentation of the speaker to the audience which can be directly contrasted with the Homeric word <em>epos</em>: a short utterance that accompanies but does not constitute performance.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, Homeric poetry itself can be understood as <em>mûthos</em>. It is “poetry meant to persuade, enacted in public, created by authority, in a context where authority is always up for grabs and to be won by the speaker with the best style” (Martin 1993:238).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n<p>Martin, R.

What we see in this particular prayer are three structural elements that are generalizable but also variable both as to their content and in their presence or absence: 1) an address to a particular divinity; 2) a statement that either <em>generates</em> a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity by speech-acting the giving of an obligatory gift now or in the future, or a statement that <em>points to</em> the past existence of a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity on the basis of previous successful interactions based on exchanges; 3) a request on the part of the speaking human that the divinity accomplish something on the human's behalf as a function of the divinity's present, past, or future obligation to do so because of the exchange relationship that is being generated, will be generated, or has existed in the past.</p><p>So here, Chrysēs first 1) names the divinity in local terms (1.37-39) for the god Apollo — he is not so named but has been identified by his Olympian name in the narrative preceding the prayer as its addressee (1.35); 2) states that in the past, he has put the roof on temples (in other words, completed their construction) and burnt thigh pieces, the choicest part of the sacrificial animals, bulls and goats, as gifts to the divinity that serve as the basis of the request that is coming next; and 3) requests that the divinity fulfill his wish, namely, \"may the Danaans <em>pay for</em> my tears with your weapons,\" an example of negative reciprocity in which bad is returned for bad, just as the overall prayer itself is based on the exchange of good for good.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.37-1.43","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Reciprocal exchange"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ritual language"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Theme"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Prayer"}],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.014487","title":"Iliad 1.43-1.52","body":"<p>comment on Apollo’s arrows indicating death by disease, in the context of discussing O.07.063-066</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.43-1.52","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.014619","title":"Iliad 1.43","body":"<p>This line is a multiform of the regular formula for concluding prayers that are labelled with the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, which is a word that designates three different kinds of discourse by using mutually exclusive formulas for each of the three.

The first chunk, <em>hōs ephat'/ephan eukhomenos/ē/oi/ai</em>, whose subject is always a previously identified mortal or mortals, designates that the discourse that precedes the line was a prayer and is concluded, and the second chunk, <em>tou d' eklue</em> |¯˘˘ | ¯˘#, designates that the divinity addressed, whose name + epithet combination is specified in the space at the end of the line, 'heard' (<em>eklue</em>, cognate with the English word '(k)listen') the prayer (for Poseidon, just the epithet <em>kuanokhaitēs 'with a glossy blue mane' occurs</em>, since his name + epithet combinations are too long to fit the metrical space) . 'Heard' is functionally unmarked in English, but in only one of the 25 occurrences of this formulaic line does it mean anything less than accepted and agreed: at <em>Iliad</em> 16.250, where Zeus accepts one part of Achilles' request about Patroklos and refuses (the verb is <em>aneneue</em> 'was refusing') the other. When the response to the prayer is (exceptionally) negative, the expression <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> 'and he/she heard him/her' is replaced with <em>aneneue de + </em>name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 6.311) 'and she was refusing'  or <em>nemesēse de</em> + name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 8.198) 'and she was outraged'. There are also two places where <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> is replaced with different verbs and divine names to express an exceptionally <em>positive</em> response on the part of the divinity (<em>Odyssey</em> 2.267 and <em>Iliad</em> 15.377). There are also two attestations when the beginning of this line, <em>hōs ephat' eukhomenos, </em>is attested in a non-sacral context that evokes one of the other meanings of the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, 'boast (of warriors in battle)'; see <em>Iliad</em> 5.106 and <em>Iliad</em> 20.393, but in both those cases (and in no others) good medieval manuscripts attest a metrically equivalent variant <i>hōs phat' <strong>ep</strong>eukhomenos </i>which is actually attested in the meaning 'boast' without variants in <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 370; so it is clear that just the first half of this formulaic line is, despite a plausible ambiguity, traditionally associated with the meaning 'pray' in sacral contexts.</p><p>In short, this line is a manifestation of a superbly efficient and expressive system for concluding a prayer. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.43","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.014795","title":"Iliad 1.50-1.53","body":"<p>The noun <em>kēla</em> that occurs in line is attested in Homeric and Hesiodic poetry by these three formulae at line initial position, line final position, and after the word break in the third foot:</p><p>#κῆλα Διός '<em>kēla</em> of Zeus' Hesiod, <em>Theogony</em> 708 and Fragment 204.138 </p><p>κῆλα θεοῖο# '<em>kēla</em> of a/the god' <em>Iliad</em> 1.53=1.383</p><p>||πιφαυκόμενς τὰ ἂ κῆλα 'showing those <em>kēla</em> of his' Hymn to Apollo 444, <em>Iliad</em> 12.280</p><p>The formulas designate the weapons of Zeus in three places (<em>Iliad</em> 12.280 and the two Hesiodic passages) and the arrows of Apollo in three places (<em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 444 as well as here and in the repetition of this passage at <em>Iliad</em> 1.383). In the case of Zeus' <em>kēla</em>, it is evident that the reference is to his fiery thunderbolts. What is not immediately apparent is that Apollo's <em>kēla</em> are in fact also fire-bearing. Here is the line from the Homeric Hymn:</p><p>ἔνθ' ἄρ' ὅ γε φλόγα δαῖε πιφαυσκόμενος τὰ ἃ κῆλα</p><p>'there he was making fire blaze, revealing those <em>kēla</em> of his...</p><p>And in this passage, in the line that just precedes the occurrence of the formula shared by Zeus and Apollo, <em>kēla</em> <em>theoio</em> 'the god's <em>kēla</em>', we read of the fire of pyres as the immediate consequence of Apollo's arrow-shooting in the line immediately before the current one: </p><p>Iliad 1.52 βαλλ'· αἰεὶ δὶ πυραὶ νεκύων καίοντο θαμεῖαι </p><p>'he was hitting them; and immediately the pyres of corpses were burning thick and fast'</p><p>It is as though the <em>kēla</em> cause the pyres to burn. In seeking the etymology of this term, an underlying assumption has been, I believe, that what Zeus and Apollo share are arrows or things like them (thunderbolts), and so the etymology of <em>kēla</em> has been sought, unsuccessfully, in words in other Indo-European languages for arrows or 'shafts'. But every occurrence of the word in Epic diction evokes <em>fire</em> as an aspect of the <em>kēla</em>. What is happening on a thematic level is also relevant, because Apollo is here exercising <em>mēnis</em> 'cosmic anger' (see <em>Iliad</em> 1.75) by way of cosmic arrows — in fact he is functioning as a variant of Zeus, since striking victims with the thunderbolt is the conventional manifestation of Zeus' <em>mēnis. </em>And we will see that fire and in fact cosmic fire that goes up to the sky can become an expression of Achilles' <em>mēnis </em>as well (on this topic, see also now G. Nagy, \"Cataclysm and Ecpyrosis, two symmetrical actions of Zeus as sky-god,\" <em>Classical Inquiries</em>, May 19, 2016, http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/cataclysm-and-ecpyrosis-two-symmetrical-actions-of-zeus-as-sky-god/). On this level, one might prefer to define this word as 'fiery shafts' rather than just 'shafts'.

That is a legitimate interpretation based on the conventions of epic syntax and of a parallel <em>prooimion</em> in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82 (which coordinates the πήματος ἀρχή &#x27;beginning of suffering&#x27; with the &#x27;plans/wishes of Zeus&#x27;) , but it is also a convention of epic <em>prooimia</em> to specify the starting point of the poem, so it is reasonable to think that the audience could at the same time sense that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from the time when&#x27; also goes back to the verb ἄειδε &#x27;sing!&#x27; in line 1, specifying the starting point of the song as the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, which line 8 then confirms.</p><p>Longer version: The verb ἐτελείετο &#x27;was beginning to be fulfilled&#x27; in line 6 is the verb of the third and last paratactic clause after the relative clause ἥ...  in line 2 of the standard <em>prooimion</em> to the <em>Iliad</em>.  The first two finite verbs of the <em>prooimion</em> are aorists (ἔθηκε, προΐαψε) whereas ἐτελείετο and the verb of the previous clause to this one, τεῦχε, are imperfects. As Leonard Palmer 1963 pp.146-148 pointed out, the use of the imperfect after &#x27;establishing&#x27; aorists in epic narrative is &#x27;autopsic&#x27;: it functions to stimulate visualizing/highlighting for the hearers, rather than being reflective of an essential contrast between narrative &#x27;points&#x27; (aorist) and enduring narrative moments (imperfect). The essence of the aorist, one could say, is that it is <em>a-horistos</em> &#x27;undefined&#x27;, or in terms of Prague School linguistics, unmarked as to duration. By contrast, the imperfects <em>do evoke visualization</em> of the past events that they specify an ongoing processes.</p><p>The sentences after the relative clause are linked by the conjunction δέ, the simplest of connectives, and they may not be felt as part of the relative clause. Parataxis rather than sustained subordination is the rule in Homeric style, as Palmer also points out, p. 156, citing Iliad 5.247-8: Αἰνείας δ᾿ υἱὸς μὲν ἀμύμονος Ἀγχίσαο / εὔχεται ἐκγεγάμεν, μήτηρ δέ οἷ ἐστ᾿ Ἀφροδίτη &#x27;Aineias claims that of blameless Anchises / he was born, and his mother is Aphrodite&#x27; (<em>not</em> &#x27;and <em>that</em> his mother was...&#x27;).  But this grammatical point raises a dilemma about the next line, which begins ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27;: if subordination is not normally sustained in Homeric syntax, then the time specification &#x27;right from when&#x27; should refer to the verb of the previous clause, ἐτελείετο, so that the message is that the process of bringing to completion the Διὸς βουλή &#x27;plan/will of Zeus&#x27; began when the two heroes started quarreling. The problem is that observable conventions of the <em>prooimia</em> to epic narratives like the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em>, and the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, require that the starting point of the narrative be specified in the <em>prooimion</em>. So one would think that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27; depends on the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε &#x27;sing,&#x27; in that the poet is asking the muse to <em>sing from</em> the correct starting point. And in fact the starting point actually is (at least nominally) the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, as is made clear by line 8, even though the poem immediately has to backtrack in order to set it up as the starting point.</p><p>On the other hand, is it possible that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27;  in the wording of this <em>prooimion</em> could also be specifying that the quarrel between the two of them is the point when <em>the plan/will of Zeus</em> (as against the μῆνις of Achilles) started on its path to fulfillment? To put it another way, is the plan of Zeus coterminous with the <em>Iliad, </em>or should we think of it as something that overlaps it, that began before and ended after it? How can we know? I would argue that the plan/will of Zeus is a cause that starts and completes with the song on the basis of the diction in the first song of Demodocus in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82, where the πήματος ἀρχή &#x27;the beginning (sic) of suffering&#x27; began to roll (κυλίνδετο, imperfect) Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς &#x27;because of the plans (plural) of great Zeus.&#x27; It (the suffering) was prophesied by Apollo at Delphi as starting when the ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν &#x27;best (plural) of the Achaeans&#x27; δηριόωντο &#x27;quarreled&#x27; (again, imperfect) — on this point, see G. Nagy <a>here</a> . So the solution to the syntactical dilemma about  ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27; is that it refers <em>both</em> to the verb ἐτελείετο &#x27;began to be fulfilled&#x27; <em>and</em> to the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε &#x27;sing!&#x27;, because 1) the convention for the specification of the starting point requires it, 2) the conventions of epic paratactic style require it, and 3) the traditional specifics of the plan/plans of Zeus require it to refer to both. Beginning in 1976, G. Nagy has shown in detail how this song of Demodocus is a multiform of our <em>Iliad</em>, and on that basis we can conceive of its diction as stemming from the same tradition as our <em>Iliad</em>. I note that the <em>prooimion</em> to the <em>Odyssey</em> ends with a globally resumptive pronoun τῶν... &#x27;of these things&#x27; whose antecedent is all of the contents of the <em>prooimion</em>, just as the narrative of Demodocus&#x27; song concludes with ταῦτ&#x27; ἄρ&#x27; ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός &#x27;these things, you see, the very famous singer began to sing&#x27; (8.83). The <em>Iliad</em> <em>prooimion</em> has no such clarifying summative construction, though understanding ἐξ οὗ δή in the way we have means that both ἄειδε at the beginning and ἐτελείετο at the end of the <em>prooimion</em> are the points from which the song begins.</p><p>Incidentally, it is also clear just from our <em>Iliad</em> that there could be at least one other starting point for the tale of Achilles&#x27; wrath. See the comment on <em>Iliad</em> 1.366-369, which also may cast light on the starting point chosen here. There is also a conflicting point of view about <em>the plan of Zeus</em> that was enunciated in the Epic Cycle and that may or may not pertain to the boundaries of the epic tale of Achilles&#x27; anger: in that context, the &#x27;plan of Zeus&#x27;  was to unburden Earth of overpopulation by generating a war that would decimate it. Tying the diction of the Iliadic <em>prooimion</em> with an allusion to that external definition of the Διὸς  βουλή in the <em>Cypria</em> appears to me to conflict with the first two conventions specified above as well as the parallel passage in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82.</p><p>L.

It also occurs twice, again in the same place in the line, in the form <em>apereisia</em> (without the last syllable elided) as the epithet of the noun <em>eedna</em> 'wedding gift' (Iliad 16.178, Odyssey 19.529; also Hesiod Frag. 198.10 [M-W], with the same line-placement as all other attestations). Like the word <em>apoina</em>, eedna also designates goods given as part of a transaction, but the transaction in question is always and only a wedding, and the goods go with a woman. The fact that <em>apereisia </em>'limitless' is an otherwise unattested traditional epithet shared only between these two kinds of exchange means that there are analogies between them. The difference between the two is that in a wedding, the gift-goods go <em>with</em> the woman, the third person whose ownership is being transferred from her father's household to her husband's father's household, whereas in a 'payment' like the one being proposed to Agamemnon here, the goods are <em>in exchange for</em> the third person, male or female, whose ownership is being transferred between two others — in this particular case, from Agamemnon to her father. In effect, what Chryses is proposing to Agamemnon and Menelaus and all the Achaeans is the reverse of a wedding gift: the father seeks to <em>retrieve</em> his daughter from a kind of spouse (in rejecting the offer, Agamemnon soon says that he actually prefers her to his own wife, Iliad 1.111-115)  by the offer of gift-goods in exchange for her. </p><p>Now we can understand why the goods offered in payment in both cases are qualified as 'without end/limit'. Such exchanges resemble an extreme form of exchange analyzed in detail by Marcel Mauss (see the note on Iliad 1.13-15) called <em>potlatch.</em> Among the Amerindians of the Pacific Northwest, positively ruinous amounts of prestige goods are offered in exchanges between groups, and the exchanges even include the flagrant casting of precious valuables into the sea, the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. The idea behind <em>potlatch</em> and the epithet <em>apereisia</em> for a payment in this instance or in the case of a wedding seem to me the same: in theory at least, they are offers of exchange that cannot be refused, and they are designed to display the ultimate wealth, prestige, and power of the party that offers them, though like other gifts they appear on the surface to be generous. Their extreme nature is also designed to be absolute in its effectiveness: the 'limitless' wedding gift cements the marriage because the husband's father's household will never give up such wealth (if the bride leaves the marriage, the wealth goes with her!), and Chryses' 'limitless' payment perfects the <em>disjunction</em> between the two parties because the wealth offered in exchange for the woman is beyond adequate as compensation for her. The key is, as Mauss showed, that gifts are both obligatory and they generate obligations in those who receive them, and the bigger the gifts the more stringent the obligations. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.13","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"apoina"}],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.016612","title":"Iliad 1.335","body":"<p> </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.335","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"aitios ‘responsible’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Will of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.016700","title":"Iliad 1.28","body":"<p> </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.28","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"skēptron 'scepter'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.016805","title":"Iliad 1.86","body":"<p>When the hero Achilles swears by the god Apollo, he marks himself as a <em>Doppelgänger</em> of the god.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.86","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"agency of Apollo"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Doppelgänger"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.016910","title":"Iliad 1.90","body":"<p>argument for the contextual unity of eukhesthai einai + comparative/superlative expressions regarding superiority in age on the one hand and prestige, physical prowess and physical beauty on the other (secular contexts)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.90","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.017015","title":"Iliad 1.91","body":"<p>The meaning of <em>eukhesthai</em> as ‘declare’ has to do with speaking for the record in the form of ‘boasting’ or ‘praying’ or ‘juridically declaring’ (Muellner 1976).

Such a majority of medieval manuscript readings is conventionally known as Ω. The manuscript known as Venetus A is among the Ω manuscripts that shows this reading in its base text. But there is also a variant of this verse, which I call “<em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant,” and this variant verse shows the variant wording Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει instead of λοιμοῖο βαρείας χεῖρας ἀφέξει. In the Venetus A, this variant wording is actually written out in the space between the Iliadic text and the text of the marginal scholia. The scholia found in that space are known as the text scholia. And the text scholia in this case add a comment after quoting the variant wording: οὕτως αἱ ᾿Αριστάρχου ‘this is the way the (two) manuscripts of Aristarchus (have it)’. Also, in the marginal scholia of the Venetus A, we read a summary of the reportage of Didymus, who says that Aristarchus, in a treatise that he produced in response to one Komanos, preferred the reading of the <em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant. And Aristarchus found the same variant in the manuscript of Rhianos and in the Massaliotike. As for Didymus himself, he found the reading of the <em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant in ‘the (two) manuscripts of Aristarchus’, to which he frequently refers. It can be shown that these two manuscripts used by Didymus had base texts that no longer matched the original base text of Aristarchus, who flourished about 150 years before Didymus (and Aristonicus). Didymus remarks that the other reading that he knows, which is what we read as <em>Iliad</em> 1.97, must have been the reading in the text of Zenodotus. The way that Didymus says this makes me think that he did not have access to the original base text of Aristarchus. The reading that we read in our base text is also given by van Thiel in the base text of his edition of the <em>Iliad</em>. By contrast with van Thiel, Allen and other modern editors give the reading “<em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant” in their base texts. They do so even though Aristarchus in his base text must have given the same reading that we give in our base text.

The reasoning given by the author is this: the Aeolians, he says, are the only Greek-speaking people who roast the <em>splánkhna</em> ‘innards’ of a sacrificial animal by using forks that have five prongs instead of three. All other Greeks use three-prong forks. This argument, based on facts of culture, is combined here with an argument based on facts of language: the Aeolic word for ‘five’ is <em>pémpe</em>, as opposed to the Ionic word, which is <em>pénte</em>. So <em>pempṓbola</em> ‘five-prong forks’ must be an Aeolic and not an Ionic word. (On debates about the phonology and morphology of <em>pempṓbola</em>, see Nagy 2011b:173–174.) In highlighting the form <em>pempṓbola</em> ‘having five prongs’, the narrator of Vita 1 is making the point that ‘Homer’ as a speaker of Greek defaults to Aeolic usage when he speaks about customs that are most familiar to him, as in the case of the Aeolian custom of using five-prong forks instead of three-prong forks for roasting sacrificial meat at an animal sacrifice. In terms of such an argument, that is why ‘Homer’ uses the Aeolic dialectal form <em>pémpe</em> ‘five’ instead of the Ionic dialectal form <em>pénte</em> ‘five’. This argument, combining cultural and linguistic facts, can be seen as a metaphor for explaining a linguistic process, to be defined here as the “Aeolic default.” (See also under <em>Aeolic default</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In terms of such a definition, Homeric diction <em>defaults</em> to an Aeolic dialectal form, as here, in the absence of a corresponding Ionic dialectal form. (On <em>Homeric diction</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In general, it is this linguistic process of the “Aeolic default” that generates the Aeolic component of Homeric diction. But this component, it is essential to keep in mind, is secondary to the Ionic component of Homeric diction, which is primary. To put it another way: the Ionic component of Homeric diction is <em>dominant</em>, while the Aeolic component is only <em>recessive</em>. Such a relationship of Ionic and Aeolic components is metaphorized in myths claiming that the birthplace of Homer was the city of Smyrna, which was originally Aeolian but then became Ionian. (For historical background on Smyrna, see under <em>Aeolian Dodecapolis</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In myths about Smyrna as Homer’s birthplace, the identity of Homer as a native of Aeolian Smyrna is superseded by the identity of Homer as a native of Ionian Smyrna. (See again under <em>Aeolian Dodecapolis</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.)</p><p></p><p>* In subject headings, I do not write out accents of transliterated Greek words.

comments I offered in Classical Inquiries 2016-2017 on <em>Iliad</em> Rhapsody 1 through Rhapsody 24, starting here with Rhapsody 1, were based mostly on details that derive from seven books that I indicate in the Bibliography by way of these abbreviations: BA, GMP, H24H, HC, HPC, HQ, HR, MoM, PasP, PH. Each one of these books has its own <em>index locorum</em>. My colleague Anita Nikkanen, an Associate Editor for the online project <em>A Homer commentary in progress</em>, tracked the sequences of Homeric verses as listed in the indices for six of these books and then summarized my comments on those verses. Following up on her meticulous work, I am in the process of converting her summaries into a form of commentary that is being incorporated into <em>AHCIP</em>. My comments on the <em>Iliad</em> as I presented them in <em>Classical Inquiries</em> 2016-2017 are merely samplings of the content that I hope to contribute to the overall commentary, to which a number of other colleagues are also contributing their own comments. That said, I now proceed to offer a sampling of comments on Rhapsody 1. At this point, my comments about this beginning of beginnings need no further introduction of their own. </p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The_Rage_of_Achilles_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo-2.jpeg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>“The Rage of Achilles,” by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, 1757, [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:1.1-1.611","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.283191","title":"","body":"<p>As Thomson argues, the metaphor is for words as fletched arrows that fly straight to their mark.
