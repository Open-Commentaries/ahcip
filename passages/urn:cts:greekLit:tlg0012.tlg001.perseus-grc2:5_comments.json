[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.055343","title":"Iliad 5","body":"<p>The momentum of the war is spirited, and the fighting mood of the warriors verges on overreaching. An outstanding example is Diomedes, who already owns a glorious past as a conquering hero in the epic tradition known as the <em>Sons of the Seven against Thebes</em> or <em>Epigonoi</em>. Now in the epic present of the <em>Iliad</em> he has a chance to outdo himself, performing deeds so glorious that they would outshine perhaps even the deeds of Achilles, who is now out of the picture. The successes of Diomedes reach the point where he is capable of feats that are superhuman, as when he lifts a rock that even two humans today could not budge—or as when he wounds the god of war himself, Ares, and then, shortly thereafter, the goddess of love and sexuality, Aphrodite. But such momentum is not to last, and the antagonism of Diomedes toward divinities will have its consequences.</p><p></p><span><img

In terms of this micro-narrative, the plot of the <em>Iliad</em>—in the sense that the name <em>Iliad</em> means ‘the story of Ilion [Troy]’—was started or even caused not by the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles, as our <em>Iliad</em> says at the beginning, but rather by an event that preceded that anger. According to this micro-narrative, what really started the Trojan War was the abduction of Helen, which was the <em>kakon</em> ‘bad thing’ that caused all the subsequent bad things, as we read here at I.05.063.

In non-negative or let us say positive contexts, <em>homoio</em>- exemplifies the making of comparisons in the form of metaphors and similes. </p><p>In the case of metaphors, Aristotle himself actually uses the word <em>homoio</em>- in his own definition of metaphor, <em>Poetics</em> 1459a5–8:</p><p>πολὺ δὲ μέγιστον τὸ μεταφορικὸν εἶναι. μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο οὔτε παρ’ ἄλλου ἔστι λαβεῖν εὐφυΐας τε σημεῖόν ἐστι· τὸ γὰρ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ τὸ ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν ἐστιν</p><p>But the greatest use of words is the use of metaphor [<em>tò metaphorikon</em> ‘that which is transferable’]. This is the only thing that cannot be learned from someone else; and it is also a sign [<em>sēmeion</em>] of a-good-quality-that-is-inborn [<em>euphuia</em>], since the making of good metaphors [<em>eu metapherein</em> ‘good transference’] is the same thing as the contemplation [<em>theōreîn</em>] of what is similar [<em>homoion</em>] to what.</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from MoM 2§§6–7.) Now we turn to similes. This term <em>simile</em> is derived from the neuter form of the Latin adjective <em>similis</em> meaning ‘similar’, from which the English word <em>similar</em> is in turn derived. In English, a <em>simile</em> is signaled by expressions such as <em>like</em> or <em>as</em> or <em>similar to</em>. As for Greek, the primary word for signaling a simile is <em>homoio</em>- in the sense of ‘similar to’. But the etymology of <em>homoio</em>- shows that the meaning ‘similar’ derives from a more basic meaning, ‘same as’. From the standpoint of Indo-European linguistics, the Greek adjective <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) derives from <em>homó</em>- (ὁμό-) ‘same as’, which in turn derives from a prototypical form *<em>somo</em>-, meaning ‘same as’. The English adjective <em>same</em> is derived from this same prototypical form. Another derivative is the Latin adjective <em>similis</em>, meaning ‘same as’ or ‘similar to’. In the usage of both Latin <em>similis</em> and Greek <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-), the same semantic principle applies: for A2 to be similar to A1, it has to be the same as A1 in some respect, which is X. Further, for A2 to be the same as A1, it has to be one with A1 in respect to X. That is because the Indo-European root *<em>som</em>- of *<em>somo</em>- ‘same as’ means ‘one’, as we see in such forms as the Latin adverb <em>semel</em> ‘one time’. And the idea of ‘one’ in words like English <em>same</em> has to do with <em>an act of comparing</em>. When we compare things, what is the ‘same as’ something else in some respect becomes ‘one with’ that something in that respect. That is how a word like Latin <em>similis</em>, deriving from the concept of ‘one’, means ‘similar to’ in the sense of ‘one with’. What is <em>similis</em> ‘similar’ to something else in some respect is ‘one with’ that something in that respect. Similarly in the case of the Greek adjective <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-), it refers to something that is ‘one with’ and therefore ‘the same as’ something else in some respect. And, as we will see in the comment on O.16.172–212, if something else is not the same, then it is <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’, which is the opposite of <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) or ‘the same kind’. As we will also see in that same comment, the extension -<em>io</em>- (-ιο-) of the two adjectives <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’ and <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is parallel to the extension -<em>io</em>- (-ιο-) of the adjectives <em>hoio</em>- (oἷο-) ‘what kind’ and <em>toio</em>- (τοῖο-) ‘that kind’.</p><p>Here we loop back to what the god Apollo says at I.05.441–442: in a negative sense, immortals cannot be the same as mortals. Still, in a special positive sense, mortals can momentarily become the same as immortals <em>when their identities merge in contexts of ritual. Such a special positive sense applies in situations of ritualized antagonism between immortal and mortal</em>. In such situations, the mortal becomes one with the immortal—and can die as a consequence. That is what almost happens to Diomedes, but then he backs off.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.441","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"homoio- 'similar to, same as'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Metaphor"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Simile"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"antagonism between immortal and mortal"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060171","title":"Iliad 5.441","body":"<p>comment on tutthon as a distance retreated by Diomedes and its relation to his respect for the boundary the transgression of which would incur mēnis (in contrast to Patroklos)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.441","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060272","title":"Iliad 5.443-5.444","body":"<p>analysis of Apollo’s anger at Diomedes</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.443-5.444","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060319","title":"Iliad 5.444","body":"<p>in the list of offenses that (threaten to) incur mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.444","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060364","title":"Iliad 5.455","body":"<p>analysis of Apollo’s call to Ares to return to fighting as referring to and contravening Athena’s earlier request that he refrain, and beginning with the same line as Athena’s request</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.455","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060414","title":"Iliad 5.455","body":"<p>analysis of miaiphonos as an epithet of Ares and as applied to Patroklos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.455","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060710","title":"Iliad 5.455","body":"<p>analysis of teichesiplēta as an epithet of and metaphor for Ares’ tendency to reach the limits of behavior (and application to Patroklos)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.455","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060758","title":"Iliad 5.456","body":"<p>analysis of the Diomedes-Ares identification/antagonism and variant theme of mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.456","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060803","title":"Iliad 5.457","body":"<p>analysis of the Diomedes-Ares identification/antagonism and thematic linkage between the mēnis of Apollo against Diomedes and that of Zeus against Ares</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.457","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060850","title":"Iliad 5.459","body":"<p>analysis of the Diomedes-Ares identification/antagonism and thematic linkage between the mēnis of Apollo against Diomedes and that of Zeus against Ares</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.459","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.060901","title":"Iliad 5.459","body":"<p>Retrospectively, Apollo in his own words is saying that Diomedes was <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a <em>daimōn</em>’ when this hero dared to attack the god.

The <em>Iliad</em> here shows a metaphorical substitution of the Trojan War for the Gigantomachy. (On metaphor, see MoM 0§01, 0§1 Extract 0-A.) For the Athenians, Athena is the primary narrator of the Gigantomachy by way of pattern-weaving the narration in her own Peplos as a masterpiece of metonymy. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.747","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Metonymy or Metonym"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Metaphor"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Gigantomachy ‘battle of the gods and giants’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Athena Parthenos (goddess virgin)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Athena Polias (goddess of the citadel)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"pattern-weaving"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"khitōn ‘tunic’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"peplos ‘robe’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062423","title":"Iliad 5.733-5.742","body":"<p>discussing the accessories of the statue of Athena Polias at Athens, here especially the aegis and the gorgoneion in the context of discussing the two aspects of Athena, as a virgin war goddess and as a mother goddess</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.742","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062469","title":"Iliad 5.733-5.742","body":"<p>analysis of the close alliance of Athena with Zeus (in the Iliad and in the myth of the gigantomachy)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.742","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062531","title":"Iliad 5.733-5.742","body":"<p>discussing the accessories of the statue of Athena Polias at Athens, here especially the aegis and the gorgoneion in the context of discussing the two aspects of Athena, as a virgin war goddess and as a mother goddess</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.742","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062579","title":"Iliad 5.733-5.742","body":"<p>analysis of the change of Athena from the mother goddess to the virgin war goddess at Athens under the influence of the Homeric poems</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.742","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062625","title":"Iliad 5.733-5.735","body":"<p>analysis of Athena’s association with/wearing peplos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:5.733-5.735","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.062957","title":"Iliad 5.734-5.735","body":"<p>The <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ made by the goddess Athena is seen as a prototype of a perfect masterpiece of pattern-weaving.
