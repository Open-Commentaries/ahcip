Then Patroklos drew near to Achilles with tears welling from his\n    eyes, as from some spring whose crystal stream falls over the ledges of a high\n    precipice. When Achilles saw him thus weeping he was sorry for him and said,\n    \"Why, Patroklos, do you stand there weeping like some silly child that comes\n    running to her mother, and begs to be taken up and carried- she catches hold of\n    her mother's dress to stay her though she is in a hurry, and looks tearfully up\n    until her mother carries her - even such tears, Patroklos, are you now\n    shedding. Have you anything to say to the Myrmidons or to myself? or have you\n    had news from <placeName key=\"perseus,Phthia\">Phthia</placeName> which you\n    alone know? They tell me Menoitios son of Aktor is still alive, as also Peleus\n    son of Aiakos, among the Myrmidons - men whose loss we two should bitterly\n    deplore; or are you grieving about the Argives and the way in which they are\n    being killed at the ships, through their own high-handed doings?

All those who have been their champions so\n    far are lying at the ships, wounded by sword or spear.

Who in future story will speak well of you unless you now save the\n    Argives from ruin?

Let me moreover wear your armor; the Trojans may thus mistake me for\n    you and quit the field, so that the hard-pressed sons of the Achaeans may have\n    breathing time- which while they are fighting may hardly be.

Achilles was deeply moved and answered, \"What,\n    noble Patroklos, are you saying? I know no prophesyings which I am heeding, nor\n    has my mother told me anything from the mouth of Zeus, but I am cut to the very\n    heart with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] that one of my own rank\n    should dare to rob me because he is more powerful than I am.

Still, let bygones be\n    bygones: no man may keep his anger for ever; I said I would not relent till\n    battle and the cry of war had reached my own ships; nevertheless, now gird my\n    armor about your shoulders, and lead the Myrmidons to battle, for the dark\n    cloud of Trojans has burst furiously over our fleet;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"67\" unit=\"line\"/>the Argives are driven back on to the beach,\n    cooped within a narrow space, and the whole people of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> has taken heart to sally out against\n    them, because they see not the visor of my helmet gleaming near them.

Moreover his left shoulder was tired with\n    having held his shield so long, yet for all this, let fly at him as they would,\n    they could not make him give ground. He could hardly draw his breath, the sweat\n    rained from every pore of his body, he had not a moment's respite, and on all\n    sides he was beset by danger upon danger. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"112\" unit=\"line\"/>And now, tell me, O Muses that hold your\n    mansions on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, how fire was\n    thrown upon the ships of the Achaeans. Hektor came close up and let drive with\n    his great sword at the ashen spear of Ajax. He cut it clean in two just behind\n    where the point was fastened on to the shaft of the spear. Ajax, therefore, had\n    now nothing but a headless spear, while the bronze point flew some way off and\n    came ringing down on to the ground. Ajax knew the hand of heaven in this, and\n    was dismayed at seeing that Zeus had now left him utterly defenseless and was\n    willing victory for the Trojans. Therefore he drew back, and the Trojans flung\n    fire upon the ship which was at once wrapped in flame. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"124\" unit=\"line\"/>The fire was now flaring about the ship's\n    stern, whereon Achilles smote his two thighs and said to Patroklos, \"Up, noble\n    horseman, for I see the glare of hostile fire at our fleet; up, lest they\n    destroy our ships, and there be no way by which we may retreat.

First\n    he greaved his legs with greaves of good make, and fitted with ankle-clasps of\n    silver; after this he donned the cuirass of the son of Aiakos, richly inlaid\n    and studded. He hung his silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders,\n    and then his mighty shield. On his comely head he set his helmet, well wrought,\n    with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it. He grasped two\n    redoubtable spears that suited his hands, but he did not take the spear of\n    noble Achilles, so stout and strong,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"141\" unit=\"line\"/>for none other of the Achaeans could wield it,\n    though Achilles could do so easily. This was the ashen spear from Mount Pelion,\n    which Chiron had cut upon a mountain top and had given to Peleus, wherewith to\n    deal out death among heroes. He bade Automedon yoke his horses with all speed,\n    for he was the man whom he held in honor next after Achilles, and on whose\n    support in battle he could rely most firmly. Automedon therefore yoked the\n    fleet horses <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> and Balios,\n    steeds that could fly like the wind: these were they whom the harpy Podarge\n    bore to the west wind, as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the\n    river Okeanos. In the side traces he set the noble horse Pedasos, whom Achilles\n    had brought away with him when he sacked the city of Eetion, and who, mortal\n    steed though he was, could take his place along with those that were immortal. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile Achilles went about everywhere among\n    the tents, and bade his Myrmidons put on their armor. Even as fierce ravening\n    wolves that are feasting upon a horned stag which they have killed upon the\n    mountains, and their jaws are red with blood - they go in a pack to lap water\n    from the clear spring with their long thin tongues; and they reek of blood and\n    slaughter; they know not what fear is, for it is hunger drives them - even so\n    did the leaders and counselors of the Myrmidons gather round the good squire\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of the fleet descendant of Aiakos,\n    and among them stood Achilles himself cheering on both men and horses. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"168\" unit=\"line\"/>Fifty ships had noble Achilles brought to\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, and in each there was a crew\n    of fifty oarsmen. Over these he set five leaders whom he could trust, while he\n    was himself commander over them all. Menesthios of the gleaming corselet, son\n    to the river Spercheios that streams from heaven, was leader of the first\n    company. Fair Polydora daughter of Peleus bore him to ever-flowing Spercheios -\n    a woman mated with a god - but he was called son of Boros son of Perieres, with\n    whom his mother was living as his wedded wife, and who gave great wealth to\n    gain her.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"178\" unit=\"line\"/>The second company was led by noble Eudoros,\n    son to an unwedded woman. Polymele, daughter of Phylas, graceful in dancing\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">khoros</term>], bore him; the mighty slayer of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Argos\">Argos</placeName> was enamored of her as he\n    saw her among the singing women at a dance [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">khoros</term>]\n    held in honor of Artemis the rushing huntress of the golden arrows; he\n    therefore - Hermes, giver of all good - went with her into an upper chamber,\n    and lay with her in secret, whereon she bore him a noble son Eudoros,\n    singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. When Eileithuia goddess of the\n    pains of child-birth brought him to the light of day, and he saw the face of\n    the sun, mighty Echekles son of Aktor took the mother to wife, and gave great\n    wealth to gain her, but her father Phylas brought the child up, and took care\n    of him, doting as fondly upon him as though he were his own son. The third\n    company was led by Peisandros son of Maimalos, the finest spearman among all\n    the Myrmidons next to Achilles' own comrade Patroklos. The old horseman Phoenix\n    was leader of the fourth company, and Alkimedon, noble son of Laerceus of the\n    fifth. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"198\" unit=\"line\"/>When Achilles had chosen [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] his men and had stationed them all with their leaders, he\n    charged them straitly saying, \"Myrmidons, remember your threats against the\n    Trojans while you were at the ships in the time of my anger, and you were all\n    complaining of me. ‘Cruel son of Peleus,’ you would say, ‘your mother must have\n    suckled you on gall, so ruthless are you. You keep us here at the ships against\n    our will; if you are so relentless it were better we went home over the sea.’\n    Often have you gathered and thus chided with me.

As the stones which a builder sets in the wall of some high\n    house which is to give shelter from the winds - even so closely were the\n    helmets and bossed shields set against one another. Shield pressed on shield,\n    helm on helm, and man on man; so close were they that the horse-hair plumes on\n    the gleaming ridges of their helmets touched each other as they bent their\n    heads. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"218\" unit=\"line\"/>In front of them all two men put on their armor\n    - Patroklos and Automedon - two men, with but one mind to lead the Myrmidons.\n    Then Achilles went inside his tent and opened the lid of the strong chest which\n    silver-footed Thetis had given him to take on board ship, and which she had\n    filled with shirts, cloaks to keep out the cold, and good thick rugs. In this\n    chest he had a cup of rare workmanship, from which no man but himself might\n    drink, nor would he make offering from it to any other god save only to father\n    Zeus. He took the cup from the chest and cleansed it with sulfur; this done he\n    rinsed it clean water, and after he had washed his hands he drew wine. Then he\n    stood in the middle of the court and prayed, looking towards heaven, and making\n    his drink-offering of wine; nor was he unseen of Zeus whose joy is in thunder.\n    \"King Zeus,\" he cried, \"lord of <placeName key=\"perseus,Dodona\">Dodona</placeName>, god of the Pelasgi, you who dwell afar, you who hold\n    wintry <placeName key=\"perseus,Dodona\">Dodona</placeName> in your sway, where\n    your seers the Selloi dwell around you with their feet unwashed and their\n    couches made upon the ground - if you heard me when I prayed to you aforetime,\n    and did me honor while you sent disaster on the Achaeans, grant me now the\n    fulfillment of yet this further prayer.

Patroklos called out to his men at the top of his\n    voice, \"Myrmidons, followers of Achilles son of Peleus, be men my friends,\n    fight with might and with main, that we may win glory for the son of Peleus,\n    who is far the foremost man at the ships of the Argives - he, and his close\n    fighting followers [therapontes].

He hit Pyraikhmes who had led his Paeonian horsemen from the\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Amydon\">Amydon</placeName> and the broad waters of\n    the river <placeName key=\"tgn,7015932\">Axios</placeName>; the spear struck him\n    on the right shoulder, and with a groan he fell backwards in the dust; on this\n    his men were thrown into confusion, for by killing their leader, who was the\n    finest warrior among them, Patroklos struck panic into them all. He thus drove\n    them from the ship and quenched the fire that was then blazing - leaving the\n    half-burnt ship to lie where it was. The Trojans were now driven back with a\n    shout that rent the skies, while the Danaans poured after them from their\n    ships, shouting also without ceasing. As when Zeus, gatherer of the\n    thunder-cloud, spreads a dense canopy on the top of some lofty mountain, and\n    all the peaks, the jutting headlands, and forest glades show out in the great\n    light that flashes from the bursting heavens, even so when the Danaans had now\n    driven back the fire from their ships, they took breath for a little while; but\n    the fury of the fight was not yet over, for the Trojans were not driven back in\n    utter rout, but still gave battle, and were ousted from their ground only by\n    sheer fighting. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"306\" unit=\"line\"/>The fight then became more scattered, and the\n    chieftains killed one another when and how they could. The valiant son of\n    Menoitios first drove his spear into the thigh of Areilykos just as he was\n    turning round; the point went clean through, and broke the bone so that he fell\n    forward. Meanwhile Menelaos struck Thoas in the chest, where it was exposed\n    near the rim of his shield, and he fell dead. The son of Phyleus saw Amphiklos\n    about to attack him, and ere he could do so took aim at the upper part of his\n    thigh, where the muscles are thicker than in any other part; the spear tore\n    through all the sinews of the leg, and his eyes were closed in darkness.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"316\" unit=\"line\"/>Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilokhos, speared\n    Atymnios, driving the point of the spear through his throat, and down he fell.\n    Maris then sprang on Antilokhos in hand-to-hand fight to avenge his brother,\n    and bestrode the body spear in hand; but valiant Thrasymedes was too quick for\n    him, and in a moment had struck him in the shoulder ere he could deal his blow;\n    his aim was true, and the spear severed all the muscles at the root of his arm,\n    and tore them right down to the bone, so he fell heavily to the ground and his\n    eyes were closed in darkness. Thus did these two noble comrades of Sarpedon go\n    down to Erebos slain by the two sons of Nestor; they were the warrior sons of\n    Amisodoros, who had reared the invincible Chimaera, to the bane of many. Ajax\n    son of Oileus sprang on Kleoboulos and took him alive as he was entangled in\n    the crush; but he killed him then and there by a sword-blow on the neck.

Lykon struck the plumed crest of\n    Peneleos' helmet but his sword broke at the hilt, while Peneleos smote Lykon on\n    the neck under the ear. The blade sank so deep that the head was held on by\n    nothing but the skin, and there was no more life left in him. Meriones gave\n    chase to Akamas on foot and caught him up just as he was about to mount his\n    chariot; he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell headlong\n    from the car, and his eyes were closed in darkness. Idomeneus speared Erymas in\n    the mouth; the bronze point of the spear went clean through it beneath the\n    brain, crashing in among the white bones and smashing them up. His teeth were\n    all of them knocked out and the blood came gushing in a stream from both his\n    eyes; it also came gurgling up from his mouth and nostrils, and the darkness of\n    death enfolded him round about. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"351\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did these chieftains of the Danaans each\n    of them kill his man.

He well knew that the fortunes\n    of the day had changed, but still stood his ground and tried to protect his\n    comrades. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"364\" unit=\"line\"/>As when a cloud goes up into heaven from\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, rising out of a clear sky\n    when Zeus is brewing a gale - even with such panic stricken rout did the\n    Trojans now flee, and there was no order in their going. Hektor's fleet horses\n    bore him and his armor out of the fight, and he left the Trojan host penned in\n    by the deep trench against their will. Many a yoke of horses snapped the pole\n    of their chariots in the trench and left their master's car behind them.\n    Patroklos gave chase, calling impetuously on the Danaans and full of fury\n    against the Trojans, who, being now no longer in a body, filled all the ways\n    with their cries of panic and rout; the air was darkened with the clouds of\n    dust they raised, and the horses strained every nerve in their flight from the\n    tents and ships towards the city. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"377\" unit=\"line\"/>Patroklos kept on heading his horses wherever\n    he saw most men fleeing in confusion, cheering on his men the while. Chariots\n    were being smashed in all directions, and many a man came tumbling down from\n    his own car to fall beneath the wheels of that of Patroklos, whose immortal\n    steeds, given by the gods to Peleus, sprang over the trench at a bound as they\n    sped onward. He was intent on trying to get near Hektor, for he had set his\n    heart on spearing him, but Hektor's horses were now hurrying him away. As the\n    whole dark earth bows before some tempest on an autumn day when Zeus rains his\n    hardest to punish men for judging [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] crookedly\n    in their courts, and arriving justice there from without heed to the decrees\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">themistes</term>] of heaven - all the rivers run full\n    and the torrents tear many a new channel as they roar headlong from the\n    mountains to the dark sea, and it fares ill with the works of men - even such\n    was the stress and strain of the Trojan horses in their flight. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"394\" unit=\"line\"/>Patroklos now cut off the battalions that were\n    nearest to him and drove them back to the ships. They were doing their best to\n    reach the city, but he would not let them, and bore down on them between the\n    river and the ships and wall. Many a fallen comrade did he then avenge. First\n    he hit Pronoos with a spear on the chest where it was exposed near the rim of\n    his shield, and he fell heavily to the ground. Next he sprang on Thestor son of\n    Enops, who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot, for he had lost his head\n    and the reins had been torn out of his hands. Patroklos went up to him and\n    drove a spear into his right jaw; he thus hooked him by the teeth and the spear\n    pulled him over the rim of his car, as one who sits at the end of some jutting\n    rock and draws a strong fish out of the sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>] with a hook and a line - even so with his spear did he pull\n    Thestor all gaping from his chariot; he then threw him down on his face and he\n    died while falling. On this, as Erylaos was on to attack him, he struck him\n    full on the head with a stone, and his brains were all battered inside his\n    helmet, whereon he fell headlong to the ground and the pangs of death took hold\n    upon him. Then he laid low, one after the other, Erymas, Amphoteros, Epaltes,\n    Tlepolemos, Echios son of Damastor, Pyris, Ipheus, Euippos and Polymelos son of\n    Argeas. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"419\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when Sarpedon saw his comrades, men who\n    wore unbelted tunics, being overcome by Patroklos son of Menoitios, he rebuked\n    the Lycians saying. \"Shame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>] on you, where\n    are you fleeing to? Show your mettle; I will myself meet this man in fight and\n    learn who it is that is so masterful; he has done us much hurt, and has\n    stretched many a brave man upon the ground.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"426\" unit=\"line\"/>He sprang from his chariot as he spoke, and\n    Patroklos, when he saw this, leaped on to the ground also.

Sarpedon then aimed a spear at Patroklos and missed him, but he struck the\n    horse Pedasos in the right shoulder, and it screamed aloud as it lay, groaning\n    in the dust until the life went out of it. The other two horses began to\n    plunge; the pole of the chariot cracked and they got entangled in the reins\n    through the fall of the horse that was yoked along with them; but Automedon\n    knew what to do; without the loss of a moment he drew the keen blade that hung\n    by his sturdy thigh and cut the third horse adrift; whereon the other two\n    righted themselves, and pulling hard at the reins again went together into\n    battle. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"477\" unit=\"line\"/>Sarpedon now took a second aim at Patroklos,\n    and again missed him, the point of the spear passed over his left shoulder\n    without hitting him. Patroklos then aimed in his turn, and the spear sped not\n    from his hand in vain, for he hit Sarpedon just where the midriff surrounds the\n    ever-beating heart. He fell like some oak or silver poplar or tall pine to\n    which woodmen have laid their axes upon the mountains to make timber for\n    ship-building - even so did he lie stretched at full length in front of his\n    chariot and horses, moaning and clutching at the blood-stained dust. As when a\n    lion springs with a bound upon a herd of cattle and fastens on a great black\n    bull which dies bellowing in its clutches - even so did the leader of the\n    Lycian warriors struggle in death as he fell by the hand of Patroklos. He\n    called on his trusty comrade and said, \"Glaukos, my brother, hero among heroes,\n    put forth all your strength, fight with might and main, now if ever quit\n    yourself like a valiant warrior. First go about among the Lycian leaders and\n    bid them fight for Sarpedon; then yourself also do battle to save my armor from\n    being taken.

Hard by the Myrmidons held\n    his snorting steeds, who were wild with panic at finding themselves deserted by\n    their lords. Glaukos was overcome with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] when he heard what Sarpedon said, for he could not help him. He\n    had to support his arm with his other hand, being in great pain through the\n    wound which Teucer's arrow had given him when Teucer was defending the wall as\n    he, Glaukos, was assailing it. Therefore he prayed to far-darting Apollo\n    saying, \"Hear me O king from your seat, may be in the fertile district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] of <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, or may be in <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, for in all places you can hear the prayer of one who is\n    in distress, as I now am.

Zeus defended not his son, do you,\n    therefore, O king, heal me of my wound, ease my pain and grant me strength both\n    to cheer on the Lycians and to fight along with them round the body of him who\n    has fallen.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"527\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer.\n    He eased his pain, staunched the black blood from the wound, and gave him new\n    strength. Glaukos perceived this, and was thankful that the mighty god had\n    answered his prayer; forthwith, therefore, he went among the Lycian leaders,\n    and bade them come to fight about the body of Sarpedon. From these he strode on\n    among the Trojans to Polydamas son of Panthoos and Agenor; he then went in\n    search of Aeneas and Hektor, and when he had found them he said, \"Hektor, you\n    have utterly forgotten your allies, who languish here for your sake far from\n    friends and home while you do nothing to support them.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>Sarpedon leader of the Lycian warriors has\n    fallen - he who was at once the right and might of <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>; Ares has laid him low by the spear of Patroklos.

Led by\n    Hektor, who was infuriated by the fall of Sarpedon, they made instantly for the\n    Danaans with all their might, while the undaunted spirit of Patroklos son of\n    Menoitios cheered on the Achaeans. First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, men who\n    needed no bidding. \"Ajaxes,\" said he, \"may it now please you to show yourselves\n    the men you have always been, or even better- Sarpedon is fallen - he who was\n    first to overleap the wall of the Achaeans; let us take the body and outrage\n    it; let us strip the armor from his shoulders, and kill his comrades if they\n    try to rescue his body.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"562\" unit=\"line\"/>He spoke to men who of themselves were full\n    eager; both sides, therefore, the Trojans and Lycians on the one hand, and the\n    Myrmidons and Achaeans on the other, strengthened their battalions, and fought\n    desperately about the body of Sarpedon, shouting fiercely the while. Mighty was\n    the din of their armor as they came together, and Zeus shed a thick darkness\n    over the fight, to increase the ordeal [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] of\n    the battle over the body of his son. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"569\" unit=\"line\"/>At first the Trojans made some headway against\n    the Achaeans, for one of the best men among the Myrmidons was killed, Epeigeus,\n    son of noble Agakles who had erewhile been king in the good city of Boudeion;\n    but presently, having killed a valiant kinsman of his own, he took refuge with\n    Peleus and Thetis, who sent him to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> the land of noble steeds to fight the Trojans under\n    Achilles.

Patroklos was enraged with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] over\n    by the death of his comrade, and sped through the front ranks as swiftly as a\n    hawk that swoops down on a flock of daws or starlings. Even so swiftly, O noble\n    horseman Patroklos, did you make straight for the Lycians and Trojans to avenge\n    your comrade. Forthwith he struck Sthenelaos the son of Ithaimenes on the neck\n    with a stone, and broke the tendons that join it to the head and spine. On this\n    Hektor and the front rank of his men gave ground. As far as a man can throw a\n    javelin in competition [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>] for some prize, or\n    even in battle - so far did the Trojans now retreat before the Achaeans.\n    Glaukos, leader of the Lycians, was the first to rally them, by killing\n    Bathykles son of Khalkon who lived in <placeName key=\"tgn,1000074\">Hellas</placeName> and was supreme in wealth [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">olbos</term>] among the Myrmidons. Glaukos turned round suddenly, just as\n    Bathykles who was pursuing him was about to lay hold of him, and drove his\n    spear right into the middle of his chest, whereon he fell heavily to the\n    ground, and the fall of so good a man filled the Achaeans with dismay [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>], while the Trojans were exultant, and came up\n    in a body round the corpse. Nevertheless the Achaeans, mindful of their\n    prowess, bore straight down upon them. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"603\" unit=\"line\"/>Meriones then killed a helmed warrior of the\n    Trojans, Laogonos son of Onetor, who was priest of Zeus of <placeName key=\"tgn,1105013\">Mount Ida</placeName>, and was honored in the district\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] as though he were a god. Meriones struck\n    him under the jaw and ear, so that life went out of him and the darkness of\n    death laid hold upon him. Aeneas then aimed a spear at Meriones, hoping to hit\n    him under the shield as he was advancing, but Meriones saw it coming and\n    stooped forward to avoid it, whereon the spear flew past him and the point\n    stuck in the ground, while the butt-end went on quivering till Ares robbed it\n    of its force. The spear, therefore, sped from Aeneas' hand in vain and fell\n    quivering to the ground.

In\n    the end, he deemed it best that the brave squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of Achilles son of Peleus should drive Hektor and the\n    Trojans back towards the city and take the lives of many.

Neither would the brave Lycians stand firm; they were dismayed\n    when they saw their king lying struck to the heart amid a heap of corpses - for\n    when the son of Kronos made the fight wax hot many had fallen above him. The\n    Achaeans, therefore stripped the gleaming armor from his shoulders and the\n    brave son of Menoitios gave it to his men to take to the ships. Then Zeus lord\n    of the storm-cloud said to Apollo, \"Dear Phoebus, go, I pray you, and take\n    Sarpedon out of range of the weapons; cleanse the black blood from off him, and\n    then bear him a long way off where you may wash him in the river, anoint him\n    with ambrosia, and clothe him in immortal raiment; this done, commit him to the\n    arms of the two fleet messengers, Death, and Sleep, who will carry him\n    straightway to the fertile district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] of\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName>, where his brothers and\n    kinsmen will give him a funeral, and will raise both mound and pillar to his\n    memory, in due honor to the dead.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"676\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus he spoke.

When Patroklos was\n    coming on like a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> for yet a fourth time,\n    Apollo shouted to him with an awful voice and said, \"Draw back, noble\n    Patroklos, it is not your lot to sack the city of the Trojan chieftains, nor\n    yet will it be that of Achilles who is a far better man than you are.\" On\n    hearing this, Patroklos withdrew to some distance and avoided the anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>] of Apollo. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"712\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile Hektor was waiting with his horses\n    inside the Scaean gates, in doubt whether to drive out again and go on\n    fighting, or to call the army inside the gates.

Apollo passed in among them, and struck panic into the Argives,\n    while he gave triumph to Hektor and the Trojans.

As the east and south wind buffet one another when\n    they beat upon some dense forest on the mountains - there is beech and ash and\n    spreading cornel; the to of the trees roar as they beat on one another, and one\n    can hear the boughs cracking and breaking -</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"770\" unit=\"line\"/>even so did the Trojans and Achaeans spring\n    upon one another and lay about each other, and neither side would give way.\n    Many a pointed spear fell to ground and many a winged arrow sped from its\n    bow-string about the body of Kebriones; many a great stone, moreover, beat on\n    many a shield as they fought around his body, but there he lay in the whirling\n    clouds of dust, all huge and hugely, heedless of his driving now. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"777\" unit=\"line\"/>So long as the sun was still high in mid-heaven\n    the weapons of either side were alike deadly, and the people fell; but when he\n    went down towards the time when men loose their oxen, the Achaeans proved to be\n    beyond all forecast stronger, so that they drew Kebriones out of range of the\n    darts and tumult of the Trojans, and stripped the armor from his shoulders.\n    Then Patroklos sprang like Ares with fierce intent and a terrific shout upon\n    the Trojans, and thrice did he kill nine men; but as he was coming on like a\n    <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> for a time, at that moment, O Patroklos,\n    was your doom approaching, for Phoebus fought you in fell earnest. Patroklos\n    did not see him as he moved about in the crush, for he was enshrouded in thick\n    darkness, and the god struck him from behind on his back and his broad\n    shoulders with the flat of his hand, so that his eyes turned dizzy. Phoebus\n    Apollo beat the helmet from off his head, and it rolled rattling off under the\n    horses' feet, where its horse-hair plumes were all begrimed with dust and\n    blood. Before this, it would not have been right [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">themis</term>] for this to happen. For before, this helmet had served to\n    protect the head and comely forehead of the godlike hero Achilles. Now,\n    however, Zeus delivered it over to be worn by Hektor. Nevertheless the end of\n    Hektor also was near. The bronze-shod spear, so great and so strong, was broken\n    in the hand of Patroklos, while his shield that covered him from head to foot\n    fell to the ground as did also the band that held it, and Apollo undid the\n    fastenings of his corselet. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"805\" unit=\"line\"/>At this his mind became clouded in derangement\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">atê</term>]; his limbs failed him, and he stood as one\n    dazed; whereon Euphorbos son of Panthoos, a Dardanian, the best spearman of his\n    time, as also the finest horseman and fleetest runner, came behind him and\n    struck him in the back with a spear, midway between the shoulders. This man as\n    soon as ever he had come up with his chariot had dismounted twenty men, so\n    proficient was he in all the arts of war - he it was, O horseman Patroklos,\n    that first drove a weapon into you, but he did not quite overpower you.\n    Euphorbos then ran back into the crowd, after drawing his ashen spear out of\n    the wound; he would not stand firm and wait for Patroklos, unarmed though he\n    now was, to attack him; but Patroklos unnerved, alike by the blow the god had\n    given him and by the spear-wound, drew back under cover of his men in fear for\n    his life. Hektor on this, seeing him to be wounded and giving ground, forced\n    his way through the ranks, and when close up with him struck him in the lower\n    part of the belly with a spear, driving the bronze point right through it, so\n    that he fell heavily to the ground to the great of the Achaeans. As when a lion\n    has fought some fierce wild-boar and worsted him - the two fight furiously upon\n    the mountains over some little fountain at which they would both drink, and the\n    lion has beaten the boar till he can hardly breathe - even so did Hektor son of\n    Priam take the life of the brave son of Menoitios who had killed so many,\n    striking him from close at hand, and vaunting over him the while. \"Patroklos,\"\n    said he, \"you deemed that you should sack our city, rob our Trojan women of\n    their freedom, and carry them off in your ships to your own country. Fool;\n    Hektor and his fleet horses were ever straining their utmost to defend them. I\n    am foremost of all the Trojan warriors to stave the day of bondage from off\n    them; as for you, vultures shall devour you here. Poor wretch, Achilles with\n    all his bravery availed you nothing; and yet I ween when you left him he\n    charged you straitly saying, ‘Come not back to the ships, horseman Patroklos,\n    till you have rent the bloodstained shirt of murderous Hektor about his body.\n    Thus I ween did he charge you, and your fool's heart answered him ‘yea’ within\n    you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"843\" unit=\"line\"/>Then, as the life ebbed out of you, you\n    answered, O horseman Patroklos: \"Hektor, vaunt as you will, for Zeus the son of\n    Kronos and Apollo have granted you victory; it is they who have vanquished me\n    so easily, and they who have stripped the armor from my shoulders; had twenty\n    such men as you attacked me, all of them would have fallen before my spear.\n    Fate and the son of Leto have overpowered me, and among mortal men Euphorbos;\n    you are yourself third only in the killing of me. I say further, and lay my\n    saying to your heart, you too shall live but for a little season; death and the\n    day of your doom are close upon you, and they will lay you low by the hand of\n    Achilles son of Aiakos.\" When he had thus spoken his eyes were closed in the\n    doom [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">telos</term>] of death, his life-breath [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] left his body and flitted down to the house of\n    Hades, mourning its sad fate and bidding farewell to the youth and vigor of its\n    manhood. Dead though he was, Hektor still spoke to him saying, \"Patroklos, why\n    should you thus foretell my doom? Who knows but Achilles, son of lovely Thetis,\n    may be smitten by my spear and die before me?\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"862\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he drew the bronze spear from the\n    wound, planting his foot upon the body, which he thrust off and let lie on its\n    back. He then went spear in hand after Automedon, squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of the fleet descendant of Aiakos, for he longed to lay\n    him low, but the immortal steeds which the gods had given as a rich gift to\n    Peleus bore him swiftly from the field. <milestone n=\"867\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
