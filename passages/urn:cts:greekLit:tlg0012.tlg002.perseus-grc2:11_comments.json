To get there, they go along the streams of the Ōkeanos, O.11.021. It is not said explicitly here that they have crossed the Ōkeanos in order to make their entrance into Hādēs, though the crossing is made explicit in the instructions of Circe at O.10.508. See the comment on O.10.508–512, Nor is it said that they will cross the Ōkeanos when they finally make their exit from Hādēs, O.11.636–640. When they do make their exit, Odysseus and his companions are pictured as reembarking on their ship and navigating it in the streams of the Ōkeanos, O.11.639–640, heading back to the sea that will take them back to the island of Circe. Then, at O.12.001–003, when they finally reach the sea again, from where they will navigate back to the island of Circe, this island is situated no longer in the Extreme West but in the Extreme East, O.12.003–004. So, by implication, they will have navigated all the way around the world by way of the Ōkeanos, from the Extreme West all the way to the Extreme East. This circumnavigation ends up at the same place where it started, at the island of Circe, but now this island is situated not in the Extreme West but in the Extreme East. So, the location of Aiaia, this island of Circe, is a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. The achievement of such a coincidence by way of the Ōkeanos can be imagined as either a looping around the world or, better, a looping under the world: either way, the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos flows from West to East to West to East and so on forever.

And then, after having performed this prayer and these promises for all the dead, he sacrifices the two sheep that he and his companions have brought with them from the island of Circe by cutting their throats, O.11.034–035, and then letting their blood flow into the shallow <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’ that he has dug, O.11.036.

If Odysseus remembers and performs the rites, all is well, the cosmic order is maintained; if he forgets, he will incur <em>mēnis </em>as a punishment. Here, too, we can see that memory leads to proper conduct and helps avoid both the wrong courses of action and <em>mēnis</em>; <em>mēnis</em>, in turn, is the punishment when the rules are transgressed, and the fear of <em>mēnis</em> keeps one on the right path. This is central to the complementarity of memory and <em>mēnis </em>and neatly illustrated by the passage: when there is memory, there will be no <em>mēnis</em>, as memory keeps one mindful of the danger of incurring <em>mēnis</em>, and so helps avoid it in the first place. On the contrary, there will only be <em>mēnis</em> when this memory is absent. The relationship between memory and <em>mēnis </em>is thus not of perfectly symmetrical reciprocity, but the provision of one in the absence of the other.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Watkins, Calvert. 1977. “On Μῆνις.” <em>Indo-European Studies</em> 3:686-722.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:11.71-11.73","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"mimnēskein - mimnēskesthai"}],"authors":[{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.220377","title":"Odyssey 11.73","body":"<p>in the list of offenses that (threaten to) incur mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:11.73","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.220425","title":"Odyssey 11.73","body":"<p>analysis of the connections of mēnis, status/social hierarchy, and death</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:11.73","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.220482","title":"Odyssey 11.75-11.78","body":"<p>|75 σῆμά τέ μοι χεῦαι πολιῆς ἐπὶ θινὶ θαλάσσης, |76 ἀνδρὸς δυστήνοιο, καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι· |77 ταῦτά τέ μοι τελέσαι πῆξαί τ’ ἐπὶ τύμβῳ ἐρετμόν, |78 τῷ καὶ ζωὸς ἔρεσσον ἐὼν μετ’ ἐμοῖσ’ ἑτάροισιν.</p><p>|75 Heap up a tomb [<em>sēma</em>] for me [= Elpenor] at the shore of the gray sea, |76 wretched man that I am, so that even those who live in the future will learn about it. |77 Bring to fulfillment [<em>teleîn</em>] these things for me, and stick the oar on top of the tomb [<em>tumbos</em>] |78 —the oar that I used when I was rowing with my companions [<em>hetairoi</em>].</p><p>These instructions are given to Odysseus by Elpenor himself or, more accurately, by his <em>psūkhē</em>, O.11.051, and the wording makes it explicit that the tomb that is to be made for this dead sailor is a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal;

He recognized me and said, |92 “Odysseus, you who are descended from the gods, noble son of Laertes, |93 why, wretched man, have you left the light of day |94 and come down to see the dead in this place without any delights? |95 Stand back from the trench and draw back your sharp sword |96 so that I may drink of the blood and tell you unmistakably true things.” |97 So he spoke, and I [= Odysseus] drew back, and sheathed my silver-studded sword, |98 putting it back into the scabbard, and then he [= Teiresias], after he had drunk the black blood, |99 began to address me with his words, faultless seer [<em>mantis</em>] that he was: |100 “It’s your homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] that you seek, a homecoming sweet as honey, O radiant Odysseus. |101 But the god will make this painful for you. I say that because I do not think |102 that the earth-shaking god [= Poseidon] will not take notice, who has lodged in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] an anger [<em>kotos</em>] against you, |103 being angry that you blinded his dear son [= Polyphemus]. |104 Still, even so, after enduring many bad experiences, you all may get home |105 if you are willing to restrain your own heart [<em>thūmos</em>] and the heart of your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>] |106 when you pilot your well-built ship to |107 the island of Thrinacia, seeking refuge from the violet-colored sea, |108 and when you find the grazing cattle and the sturdy sheep |109 that belong to the god of the sun, Hēlios, who sees everything and hears everything. |110 If you leave these herds unharmed and think only about homecoming [<em>nostos</em>], |111 then you could still make it to Ithaca, arriving there after having endured many bad experiences. |112 But if you harm the herds, then I forewarn you of destruction |113 both for your ship and for your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], and, even if you may yourself escape, |114 you will return [<em>neesthai</em>] in a bad way, losing all your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], |115 in someone else’s ship, not your own, and you will find painful things happening in your house, |116 I mean, you will find high-handed men there who are devouring your livelihood |117 while they are courting your godlike wife and offering wedding-presents to her. |118 But you will avenge the outrages committed by those men when you get home. |119 But after you kill the suitors in your own house, |120 killing them either by trickery or openly, by way of sharp bronze, |121 you must go on a journey then, taking with you a well-made oar, |122 until you come to a place where men do not know what the sea is |123 and do not even eat any food that is mixed with sea salt, |124 nor do they know anything about ships, which are painted purple on each side, |125 and well-made oars that are like wings for ships. |126 And I will tell you a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking. |127 Whenever someone on the road encounters you |128 and says that it must be a winnowing shovel that you have on your radiant shoulder, |129 at that point you must stick into the ground the well-made oar |130 and sacrifice beautiful sacrifices to lord Poseidon: |131 a ram, a bull, and a boar that mounts sows. |132 And then go home and offer sacred hecatombs |133 to the immortal gods who possess the vast expanses of the skies. |134 Sacrifice to them in proper order, one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, |135 a gentle death, that is how it will come, and this death will kill you |136 as you lose your strength in a prosperous old age. And the people all around [your corpse] |137 will be blessed [<em>olbioi</em>]. All the things I say are unmistakably true.”</p><p>The very first word uttered by Teiresias is <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’, O.11.100. The use of this word here is connected with the fact that, earlier in the narrative, the seer Teiresias is described as exceptionally possessing consciousness even in Hādēs, and the word used for the idea of consciousness is <em>nóos</em>. The revelations of Teiresias are activated by his <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, in the specific sense of ‘consciousness’. See the comment on O.10.490–495, with reference to the permission granted by Persephone for Teiresias to have the <em>nóos</em> ‘consciousness’, O.10.494, that is needed for ‘thinking’, <em>pepnûsthai</em>, even in Hādēs. It is relevant that the <em>nóos</em> or ‘consciousness’ of the ‘spirit’ or <em>psūkhē</em> of the seer Teiresias is properly activated only after he drinks the blood of the two sacrificial sheep that Odysseus slaughters in order to make mental contact with this seer, as we see at O.11.095–098. What Teiresias will then reveal, by way of his <em>nóos</em>, will be a heroic definition for Odysseus, whose goal is to achieve a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’, as signaled at O.11.100. See further the comment on O.11.100.

(What follows is an epitome of H24H 11§§33, 41–44.) In an essay entitled “<em>Sēma</em> and <em>Noēsis</em>: The Hero’s Tomb and the ‘Reading’ of Symbols in Homer and Hesiod” (GMP 202–222), I analyzed at some length the mystical prophecy spoken by the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of the <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’ Teiresias at O.11.119–137 about an odyssey beyond the <em>Odyssey</em>. As I argued in that essay, the verses of this prophecy point to the future death of Odysseus and to the mystical vision of his own tomb, where he will be worshipped as a cult hero. My argument can be divided into four parts:</p><p>Part 1. </p><p>Teiresias is predicting that Odysseus will meet his death in a mystical moment where he experiences <em>a coincidence of opposites</em>. And what is this mystical moment? It is a point where <u>the sea and the negation of the sea coincide</u>. That is, <u>Odysseus goes as far away as possible from the sea, only to experience death from the sea</u>: ‘death shall come to you from the sea, |135 a gentle death’, O.11.134-135. See the comment below on these lines. At this same point, where  the sea and the negation of the sea coincide, the oar that he carries on his shoulder, which is an instrument linked exclusively with the sea, will be mistaken for a winnowing shovel, which is an instrument linked exclusively with the earth, that is, with the cultivation of the land: ‘Whenever someone on the road encounters you |128 and says that it must be a winnowing shovel that you have on your radiant shoulder’, O.11.127-128. And here is another coincidence of opposites: Odysseus at this point must sacrifice to Poseidon, god of the sea, O.11.130-131, even though this point is as far away from the sea as possible. </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>And now we come to a mystical vision: in sacrificing to Poseidon, Odysseus must mark the place of sacrifice by sticking into the ground the oar that he was carrying on his shoulder: ‘at that point you must stick into the ground the well-made oar’, O.11.129. As I will now argue, what we are seeing here is a mystical vision of the tomb of Odysseus himself. The key to my argument is what the <em>psūkhē</em> of Teiresias says in introducing his prophecy: ‘And I [= Teiresias] will tell you [= Odysseus] a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking’, O.11.126. The wording here matches exactly the wording of Nestor addressed to Antilokhos in the <em>Iliad</em>: ‘And I [= Nestor] will tell you [= Antilokhos] a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking’, I.23.326. In that case, it can be argued that the <em>sēma</em> of Nestor for Antilokhos is a ‘sign’ as marked by the ‘tomb’ of a cult hero who has not yet been identified as Patroklos. See the comment on I.23.326–343. In the <em>Odyssey</em> as well, I argue, the <em>sēma</em> of Teiresias for Odysseus is a ‘sign’ as marked by the ‘tomb’ of a cult hero who has not yet been identified as Odysseus himself.</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>There is archaeological evidence for the existence of a hero cult of Odysseus on the island of Ithaca, dating back to an early period when the <em>Odyssey</em> as we know it was still taking shape (H24H 11§43). And, in the version of the story as we see it in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus dies finally in Ithaca, which figures here as his homeland, O.11.132–137. In terms of this version of the story, then, Ithaca is recognized in the <em>Odyssey</em> as a prime location for the hero cult of Odysseus.</p><p>Part 4.</p><p>This is not to say, however, that Ithaca was the only place where Odysseus was worshipped as a cult hero. From the testimony of Pausanias 8.44.4, for example, we see traces of a hero cult of Odysseus in landlocked Arcadia, which is located in the Peloponnesus and which is as far away from the sea as you can possibly be in the Peloponnesus. Here is the relevant testimony of Pausanias 8.44.4:</p><p>ἔστι δὲ ἄνοδος ἐξ Ἀσέας ἐς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Βόρειον καλούμενον, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ ἄκρᾳ τοῦ ὄρους σημεῖά ἐστιν ἱεροῦ· ποιῆσαι δὲ τὸ ἱερὸν Ἀθηνᾷ τε Σωτείρᾳ καὶ Ποσειδῶνι Ὀδυσσέα ἐλέγετο ἀνακομισθέντα ἐξ Ἰλίου.</p><p>There is a path leading uphill from Asea [in Arcadia] to the mountain called the North Mountain [<em>Boreion</em>], and on top of that mountain there are traces of a sacred space; it is said that Odysseus had made this sacred space in honor of Athena the Savior [<em>sōteira</em>] and in honor of Poseidon, in return for his having arrived back home safely from Ilion [= Troy]. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:11.119-11.137","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"sēma ‘sign, signal; tomb’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"coincidence of opposites"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"plot of an odyssey beyond the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"prophecy of Teiresias"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.221135","title":"Odyssey 11.124","body":"<p>The description of ships here at O.11.124 and also at O.23.271 as <em>phoinikoparēioi</em> ‘having cheeks of purple’ is to be contrasted with the description <em>miltoparēioi</em> ‘having cheeks of red’ at O.09.125 as also at I.02.637.

Here, Odysseus stresses that Persephone “bid” the <em>psukhai</em> of the heroines to approach the animals he had slaughtered; at <em>Odyssey</em> 11.385-86, resuming his narration after an “intermezzo” in which he converses with Arete and Alkinoos, Odysseus transitions to the “Catalogue of Heroes” by explaining that Agamemnon appeared “when reverend Persephone scattered in various directions the <em>psukhai</em> of the women.” Odysseus thus presents Persephone as the ‘director’ of this portion of his narrative, a position that corresponds to that of Athena as ‘director’ of the plot of the <em>Odyssey</em> (on Athena as ‘director,’ see Murnaghan 2005, de Jong 2001:66). The emphasis on Persephone, then, is one of several reminders of the fact that the story of Odysseus’ homecoming unfolds as a result of Athena’s active intervention (see note on <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). It also points to the importance of another female sponsor, Arete, at this particular moment in Odysseus’ story. Odysseus has been advised by Athena that his hopes for a homecoming depend especially on Arete's good will (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.75-9; the importance of Arete in this regard seems to figure the importance of Penelope as the woman on whose good will Odysseus’ homecoming ultimately depends). The “Catalogue of Heroines” has been described as “Odysseus’ gift to Arete” (Pache 1999:28), an effort to appeal to her interests just as the “Catalogue of Heroes” explicitly answers Alkinoos’ request to hear about the <em>psukhai </em>of those who fell at Troy. The appeal is a success: Arete responds by urging the Phaeacians to present Odysseus with additional gifts. By underscoring the importance of Persephone as the one who directs the Catalogue, Odysseus may subtly suggest to his patroness that she has the power to direct the subsequent course of his own story.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nde Jong, I.
