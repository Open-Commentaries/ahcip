And as a bitch stands over her tender whelps<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>growling, when she sees a man she does not know, and is eager to fight, so his heart growled within him in his wrath at their evil deeds; but he smote his breast, and rebuked his heart, saying:\n    “Endure, my heart; a worse thing even than this didst thou once endure on that day when the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, unrestrained in daring, devoured my<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"20\" unit=\"line\"/>mighty comrades; but thou didst endure until craft got thee forth from the cave where thou thoughtest to die.”\n    So he spoke, chiding the heart in his breast, and his heart remained bound<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> within him to endure steadfastly; but he himself lay tossing this way and that.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>And as when a man before a great blazing fire turns swiftly this way and that a paunch full of fat and blood, and is very eager to have it roasted quickly, so Odysseus tossed from side to side, pondering how he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>one man as he was against so many. Then Athena came down from heaven and drew near to him in the likeness of a woman, and she stood above his head, and spoke to him, and said:\n    “Why now again art thou wakeful, ill-fated above all men?

There is weariness also in keeping wakeful watch the whole night through; and even now shalt thou come forth from out thy perils.”\n    So she spoke, and shed sleep upon his eyelids,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>but herself, the fair goddess, went back to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>.\n    Now while sleep seized him, loosening the cares of his heart, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his true-hearted wife awoke, and wept, as she sat upon her soft bed.

For this night again there lay by my side one like him, even such as he was when he went forth with the host, and my heart<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"90\" unit=\"line\"/>was glad, for I deemed it was no dream, but the truth at last.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"91"},{"n":"91","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"91\">\n    <p>\n    So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn.

Now the others were sleeping, for they had ground their wheat,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"110\" unit=\"line\"/>but she alone had not yet ceased, for she was the weakest of all. She now stopped her mill and spoke a word, a sign for her master:\n    “Father Zeus, who art lord over gods and men, verily loud hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there any cloud: surely this is a sign that thou art showing to some man.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"115\" unit=\"line\"/>Fulfil now even for wretched me the word that I shall speak.

He slung his sharp sword about his shoulder, and beneath his shining feet he bound his fair sandals; and he took his mighty spear, tipped with sharp bronze, and went and stood upon the threshold, and spoke to Eurycleia:\n    “Dear nurse, have ye honored the stranger in our house<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"130\" unit=\"line\"/>with bed and food, or does he lie all uncared for?

And he went his way to the place of assembly to join the company of the well-greaved Achaeans, but Eurycleia, the goodly lady, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor, called to her maidens, saying:\n    “Come, let some of you busily sweep the hall<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>and sprinkle it, and throw on the shapely chairs coverlets of purple, and let others wipe all the tables with sponges and cleanse the mixing-bowls and the well-wrought double cups, and others still go to the spring for water and bring it quickly here.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>For the wooers will not long be absent from the hall, but will return right early; for it is a feast-day for all men.”\n    So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Twenty of them went to the spring of dark water, and the others busied themselves there in the house in skilful fashion.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>Then in came the serving-men of the Acheans, who thereafter split logs of wood well and skilfully; and the women came back from the spring. After them came the swineherd, driving three boars which were the best in all his herd.

And near to them came Melanthius the goatherd, leading she-goats that were the best in all the herds,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>to make a feast for the wooers, and two herdsmen followed with him. The goats he tethered beneath the echoing portico, and himself spoke to Odysseus with taunting words:\n    “Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us here in the hall, asking alms of men, and wilt thou not begone?<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"180\" unit=\"line\"/>'Tis plain, methinks, that we two shall not part company till we taste one another's fists, for thy begging is in no wise decent.

The beasts he tethered carefully beneath the echoing portico,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"190\" unit=\"line\"/>but himself came close to the swineherd and questioned him, saying: \n    “Who is this stranger, swineherd, who has newly come to our house?

Yet truly in form he is like a royal prince;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"195\" unit=\"line\"/>howbeit the gods bring to misery far-wandering men, whenever they spin for them the threads of trouble, even though they be kings.”\n    Therewith he drew near to Odysseus, and stretching forth his right hand in greeting, spoke and addressed him with winged words:\n    “Hail, Sir stranger;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows! Father Zeus, no other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no pity on men when thou hast thyself given them birth, but bringest them into misery and wretched pains. The sweat broke out on me when I marked the man, and my eyes are full of tears<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>as I think of Odysseus; for he, too, I ween, is clothed in such rags and is a wanderer among men, if indeed he still lives and beholds the light of the sun. But if he is already dead and in the house of Hades, then woe is me for blameless Odysseus, who<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"210\" unit=\"line\"/>set me over his cattle, when I was yet a boy, in the land of the Cephallenians And now these wax past counting; in no other wise could the breed of broad-browed cattle yield better increase<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> for a mortal man. But strangers bid me drive these now for themselves to eat, and they care nothing for the son in the house,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>nor do they tremble at the wrath of the gods, for they are eager now to divide among themselves the possessions of our lord that has long been gone. Now, as for myself, the heart in my breast keeps revolving this matter: a very evil thing it is, while the son lives, to depart along with my cattle and go to a land of strangers,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>even to an alien folk; but this is worse still, to remain here and suffer woes in charge of cattle that are given over to others. Aye, verily, long ago would I have fled and come to some other of the proud kings, for now things are no more to be borne; but still I think of that hapless one, if perchance he might come back I know not whence,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"225\" unit=\"line\"/>and make a scattering of the wooers in his house.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"226"},{"n":"226","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"226\">\n    <p>\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Neatherd, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and I see for myself that thou hast gotten an understanding heart, therefore will I speak out and swear a great oath to confirm my words.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"230\" unit=\"line\"/>Now be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily while thou art here Odysseus shall come home, and thou shalt see with thine eyes, if thou wilt, the slaying of the wooers, who lord it here.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the herdsman of the cattle answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that the son of Cronos might fulfil this word of thine!

Meanwhile the heralds were leading through the city the holy hecatomb of the gods, and the long-haired Achaeans gathered together beneath a shady grove of Apollo, the archer-god.\n    But when they had roasted the outer flesh and drawn it off the spits,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"280\" unit=\"line\"/>they divided the portions and feasted a glorious feast.

There was among the wooers a man with his heart set on lawlessness—Ctesippus was his name, and in Same was his dwelling—who, trusting forsooth in his boundless wealth,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"290\" unit=\"line\"/>wooed the wife of Odysseus, that had long been gone. He it was who now spoke among the haughty wooers:\n    “Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. A portion has the stranger long had, an equal portion, as is meet; for it is not well nor just to rob of their due<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"295\" unit=\"line\"/>the guests of Telemachus, whosoever he be that comes to this house. Nay, come, I too will give him a stranger's-gift, that he in turn may give a present either to the bath-woman or to some other of the slaves who are in the house of godlike Odysseus.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"299"},{"n":"299","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"299\">\n    <p>\n    So saying, he hurled with strong hand the hoof of an ox,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"300\" unit=\"line\"/>taking it up from the basket where it lay. But Odysseus avoided it with a quick turn of his head, and in his heart he smiled a right grim and bitter smile; and the ox's hoof struck the well-built wall. Then Telemachus rebuked Ctesippus, and said:\n    “Ctesippus, verily this thing fell out more to thy soul's profit.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"305\" unit=\"line\"/>Thou didst not smite the stranger, for he himself avoided thy missile, else surely would I have struck thee through the middle with my sharp spear, and instead of a wedding feast thy father would have been busied with a funeral feast in this land. Wherefore let no man, I warn you, make a show of forwardness in my house; for now I mark and understand all things,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"310\" unit=\"line\"/>the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child. But none the less we still endure to see these deeds, while sheep are slaughtered, and wine drunk, and bread consumed, for hard it is for one man to restrain many.

Abuse not any more the stranger nor any<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"325\" unit=\"line\"/>of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But to Telemachus and his mother I would speak a gentle word, if perchance it may find favour in the minds of both. So long as the hearts in your breasts had hope that wise Odysseus would return to his own house,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"330\" unit=\"line\"/>so long there was no ground for blame that you waited, and restrained the wooers in your halls; for this was the better course, had Odysseus returned and come back to his house.

Nay then, come, sit by thy mother and tell her this,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"335\" unit=\"line\"/>namely that she must wed him whosoever is the best man, and who offers the most gifts; to the end that thou mayest enjoy in peace all the heritage of thy fathers, eating and drinking, and that she may keep the house of another.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nay, by Zeus, Agelaus, and by the woes of my father,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"340\" unit=\"line\"/>who somewhere far from <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName> has perished or is wandering, in no wise do I delay my mother's marriage, but I bid her wed what man she will, and I offer besides gifts past counting.
