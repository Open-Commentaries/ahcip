This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira, and had been\n    chosen as a prize for Alkinoos because he was king over the Phaeacians, and the\n    people in the <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term> obeyed him as though he were a\n    god.

I\n    will go before you and show the way, but say not a word as you go, and do not\n    look at any man, nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide\n    strangers, and do not like men who come from some other place.

He admired their\n    harbors, ships, places of assembly, and the lofty walls of the city, which,\n    with the palisade on top of them, were very striking, and when they reached the\n    king's house Athena said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"48\" unit=\"line\"/>\"This is the house, father stranger, which you\n    would have me show you. You will find a number of great people sitting at\n    table, but do not be afraid; go straight in, for the bolder a man is the more\n    likely he is to carry his point, even though he is a stranger. First find the\n    queen. Her name is Arete, and she comes of the same family as her husband\n    Alkinoos. They both descend originally from Poseidon, who was father to\n    Nausithoos by Periboia, a woman of great beauty. Periboia was the youngest\n    daughter of Eurymedon, who at one time reigned over the giants, but he ruined\n    his ill-fated people and lost his own life to boot.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"61\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Poseidon, however, lay with his daughter, and\n    she had a son by him, the great Nausithoos, who reigned over the Phaeacians.\n    Nausithoos had two sons Rhexenor and Alkinoos; Apollo killed the first of them\n    while he was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter\n    Arete, whom Alkinoos married, and honors as no other woman is honored of all\n    those that keep house along with their husbands.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"69\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus she both was, and still is, respected\n    beyond measure by her children, by Alkinoos himself, and by the whole people,\n    who look upon her as a goddess, and greet her whenever she goes about the city,\n    for she is a thoroughly good woman both in head [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] and heart, and when any women are friends of hers, she will\n    help their husbands also to settle their disputes.

She went to Marathon and to\n    the spacious streets of <placeName key=\"perseus,Athens\">Athens</placeName>,\n    where she entered the abode of Erechtheus; but Odysseus went on to the house of\n    Alkinoos, and he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the\n    threshold of bronze, for the splendor of the palace was like that of the sun or\n    moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end, and the cornice\n    was of blue enamel. The doors were gold, and hung on pillars of silver that\n    rose from a floor of bronze, while the lintel was silver and the hook of the\n    door was of gold.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"91\" unit=\"line\"/>On either side there stood gold and silver\n    mastiffs which Hephaistos, with his consummate skill, had fashioned expressly\n    to keep watch over the palace of king Alkinoos; so they were immortal and could\n    never grow old. Seats were ranged all along the wall, here and there from one\n    end to the other, with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the\n    house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit and eat\n    and drink, for there was abundance at all seasons; and there were golden\n    figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands, raised on pedestals,\n    to give light by night to those who were at table. There are fifty maid\n    servants in the house, some of whom are always grinding rich yellow grain at\n    the mill, while others work at the loom, or sit and spin, and their shuttles\n    go, backwards and forwards like the fluttering of aspen leaves, while the linen\n    is so closely woven that it will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best\n    sailors in the world, so their women excel all others in weaving, for Athena\n    has taught them all manner of useful arts, and they are very intelligent.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"112\" unit=\"line\"/>Outside the gate of the outer court there is a\n    large garden of about four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of\n    beautiful trees - pears, pomegranates, and the most delicious apples. There are\n    luscious figs also, and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor fail\n    all the year round, neither winter nor summer, for the air is so soft that a\n    new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on pear, apple on apple,\n    and fig on fig, and so also with the grapes, for there is an excellent\n    vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this, the grapes are being made into\n    raisins; in another part they are being gathered; some are being trodden in the\n    wine tubs, others further on have shed their blossom and are beginning to show\n    fruit, others again are just changing color. In the furthest part of the ground\n    there are beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year\n    round. Two streams go through it, the one turned in ducts throughout the whole\n    garden, while the other is carried under the ground of the outer court to the\n    house itself, and the town's people draw water from it. Such, then, were the\n    splendors with which the gods had endowed the house of king Alkinoos.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"133\" unit=\"line\"/>So here Odysseus stood for a while and looked\n    about him, but when he had looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went\n    within the precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among\n    the Phaeacians making their drink-offerings to Hermes, which they always did\n    the last thing before going away for the night. He went straight through the\n    court, still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which Athena had enveloped him,\n    till he reached Arete and King Alkinoos; then he laid his hands upon the knees\n    of the queen, and at that moment the miraculous darkness fell away from him and\n    he became visible. Every one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man\n    there, but Odysseus began at once with his petition.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"146"},{"n":"146","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"146\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"146\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Queen Arete,\" he exclaimed, \"daughter of great\n    Rhexenor, in my distress I humbly pray you, as also your husband and these your\n    guests (whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">olbos</term>], and may they leave their possessions to their\n    children, and all the honors conferred upon them by the state [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>]) to help me home to my own country as soon as\n    possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my friends.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"153\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes\n    and they all held their peace, till presently the old hero Echeneus, who was an\n    excellent speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians, plainly and in all honesty\n    addressed them thus:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"159\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Alkinoos,\" said he, \"it is not creditable to\n    you that a stranger should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth;\n    every one is waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him, then, to rise\n    and take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver, and bid your servants mix some\n    wine and water that we may make a drink-offering to Zeus the lord of thunder,\n    who takes all well-disposed suppliants under his protection; and let the\n    housekeeper give him some supper, of whatever there may be in the house.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"167\" unit=\"line\"/>When Alkinoos heard this he took Odysseus by\n    the hand, raised him from the hearth, and bade him take the seat of Laodamas,\n    who had been sitting beside him, and was his favorite son. A maid servant then\n    brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin\n    for him to wash his hands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper\n    servant brought him bread and offered him many good things of what there was in\n    the house, and Odysseus ate and drank. Then Alkinoos said to one of the\n    servants, \"Pontonoos, mix a cup of wine and hand it round that we may make\n    drink-offerings to Zeus the lord of thunder, who is the protector of all\n    well-disposed suppliants.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"182"},{"n":"182","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"182\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"182\" unit=\"line\"/>Pontonoos then mixed wine and water, and handed\n    it round after giving every man his drink-offering. When they had made their\n    offerings, and had drunk each as much as he was minded, Alkinoos said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"186\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Aldermen and town councilors of the\n    Phaeacians, hear my words. You have had your supper, so now go home to bed.\n    Tomorrow morning I shall invite a still larger number of aldermen, and will\n    give a sacrificial banquet in honor of our guest; we can then discuss the\n    question of his escort, and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing\n    to his own country without toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] or\n    inconvenience to himself, no matter how distant it may be. We must see that he\n    comes to no harm while on his homeward journey, but when he is once at home he\n    will have to take the luck he was born with for better or worse like other\n    people. It is possible, however, that the stranger is one of the immortals who\n    has come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are departing\n    from their usual practice, for hitherto they have made themselves perfectly\n    clear to us when we have been offering them hecatombs. They come and sit at our\n    feasts just like one of our selves, and if any solitary wayfarer happens to\n    stumble upon some one or other of them, they affect no concealment, for we are\n    as near of kin to the gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"207\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Odysseus said: \"Pray, Alkinoos, do not\n    take any such notion into your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me,\n    neither in body nor mind, and most resemble those among you who are the most\n    afflicted. Indeed, were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon\n    me, you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless, let\n    me sup in spite of sorrow, for an empty stomach is a very importunate thing,\n    and thrusts itself on a man's notice no matter how dire is his distress [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>]. I am in great distress [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>], yet it insists that I shall eat and drink, bids me lay\n    aside all memory of my sorrows and dwell only on the due replenishing of\n    itself.

Every one approved his\n    saying, and agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken\n    reasonably.

Arete was the first to speak, for she\n    recognized the shirt, cloak, and good clothes that Odysseus was wearing, as the\n    work of herself and of her maids; so she said, \"Stranger, before we go any\n    further, there is a question I should like to ask you.

She lives by herself\n    far from all neighbors human or divine. A <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term>,\n    however, led me to her hearth all desolate and alone, for Zeus struck my ship\n    with his thunderbolts, and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave comrades were\n    drowned every man of them, but I stuck to the keel and was carried hither and\n    thither for the space of nine days, till at last during the darkness of the\n    tenth night the gods brought me to the Ogygian island where the great goddess\n    Calypso lives. She took me in and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed\n    she wanted to make me immortal that I might never grow old, but she could not\n    persuade me to let her do so.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"259\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I stayed with Calypso seven years straight on\n    end, and watered the good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole\n    time; but at last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own\n    free will, either because Zeus had told her she must, or because she had\n    changed her mind [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>]. She sent me from her\n    island on a raft, which she provisioned with abundance of bread and wine.\n    Moreover she gave me good stout clothing, and sent me a wind that blew both\n    warm and fair. Seventeen days did I sail over the sea, and on the eighteenth I\n    caught sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast - and glad\n    indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much trouble\n    in store for me, for at this point Poseidon would let me go no further, and\n    raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly high that I could no\n    longer keep to my raft, which went to pieces under the fury of the gale, and I\n    had to swim for it, till wind and current brought me to your shores.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"278\" unit=\"line\"/>\"There I tried to land, but could not, for it\n    was a bad place and the waves dashed me against the rocks, so I again took to\n    the sea and swam on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing\n    place, for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here, then,\n    I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was coming\n    on, so I left the river, and went into a thicket, where I covered myself all\n    over with leaves, and presently heaven sent me off into a very deep sleep. Sick\n    and sorry as I was I slept among the leaves all night, and through the next day\n    till afternoon, when I woke as the sun was westering, and saw your daughter's\n    maid servants playing upon the beach, and your daughter among them looking like\n    a goddess. I besought her aid, and she proved to be of an excellent\n    disposition, much more so than could be expected from so young a person - for\n    young people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,\n    and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the clothes in\n    which you see me.
