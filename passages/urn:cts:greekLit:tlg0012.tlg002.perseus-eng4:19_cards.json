I can therefore show no attention to\n    strangers, nor suppliants, nor to people who say that they are skilled\n    artisans, but am all the time brokenhearted about Odysseus. They want me to\n    marry again at once, and I have to invent stratagems in order to deceive them.\n    In the first place a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> put it in my mind to\n    set up a great tambour-frame in my room, and to begin working upon an enormous\n    piece of fine needlework. Then I said to them, ‘Sweethearts, Odysseus is indeed\n    dead, still, do not press me to marry again immediately; wait - for I would not\n    have my skill in needlework perish unrecorded - till I have finished making a\n    shroud for the hero <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, to be\n    ready against the time when death shall take him.

I fooled them in this way for three years\n    without their finding it out, but as time [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôra</term>]\n    wore on and I was now in my fourth year, in the waning of moons, and many days\n    had been accomplished, those good-for-nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to\n    the suitors, who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry with me,\n    so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And now I do not see\n    how I can find any further shift for getting out of this marriage. My parents\n    are putting great pressure upon me, and my son chafes at the ravages the\n    suitors are making upon his estate, for he is now old enough to understand all\n    about it and is perfectly able to look after his own affairs, for heaven has\n    blessed him with an excellent disposition. Still, notwithstanding all this,\n    tell me who you are and where you come from - for you must have had father and\n    mother of some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"164\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Odysseus answered, \"Lady, wife of\n    Odysseus, since you persist in asking me about my family, I will answer, no\n    matter what it costs me: people must expect to be pained [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] when they have been exiles as long as I have, and suffered as\n    much among as many peoples. Nevertheless, as regards your question I will tell\n    you all you ask. There is a fair and fruitful island in mid-ocean called\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName>; it is thickly peopled and\n    there are nine cities in it: the people speak many different languages which\n    overlap one another, for there are Achaeans, brave Eteocretans, Dorians of\n    three-fold race, and noble Pelasgi. There is a great town there, <placeName key=\"perseus,Knossos\">Knossos</placeName>, where Minos reigned who every\n    nine years had a conference with Zeus himself. Minos was father to Deukalion,\n    whose son I am, for Deukalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus\n    sailed for <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, and I, who am the\n    younger, am called Aithon; my brother, however, was at once the older and the\n    more valiant of the two; hence it was in <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName> that I saw Odysseus and showed him hospitality, for the\n    winds took him there as he was on his way to <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and\n    leaving him in <placeName key=\"perseus,Amnisos\">Amnisos</placeName> off the\n    cave of Eileithuia, where the harbors are difficult to enter and he could\n    hardly find shelter from the winds that were then raging. As soon as he got\n    there he went into the town and asked for Idomeneus, claiming to be his old and\n    valued friend, but Idomeneus had already set sail for <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> some ten or twelve days earlier, so I\n    took him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality, for I had\n    abundance of everything. Moreover, I fed the men who were with him with barley\n    meal from the public store, and got subscriptions of wine and oxen for them to\n    sacrifice to their heart's content. They stayed with me twelve days, for there\n    was a gale blowing from the North so strong that one could hardly keep one's\n    feet on land. I suppose some unfriendly <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> had\n    raised it for them, but on the thirteenth day the wind dropped, and they got\n    away.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"203\" unit=\"line\"/>Many a plausible tale did Odysseus further tell\n    her, and Penelope wept as she listened, for her heart was melted. As the snow\n    wastes upon the mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have\n    breathed upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water, even\n    so did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time\n    sitting by her side. Odysseus felt for her and was for her, but he kept his\n    eyes as hard as or iron without letting them so much as quiver, so cunningly\n    did he restrain his tears. Then, when she had relieved herself by weeping, she\n    turned to him again and said: \"Now, stranger, I shall put you to the test and\n    see whether or not you really did entertain my husband and his men, as you say\n    you did. Tell me, then, how he was dressed, what kind of a man he was to look\n    at, and so also with his companions.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"220"},{"n":"220","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"220\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Lady,\" answered Odysseus, \"it is such a long\n    time ago that I can hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my\n    home, and went elsewhere; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.\n    Odysseus wore a mantle of purple wool, double lined, and it was fastened by a\n    gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this there was a\n    device that showed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his fore paws, and\n    watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one marveled at the way in\n    which these things had been done in gold, the dog looking at the fawn, and\n    strangling it, while the fawn was struggling convulsively to escape. As for the\n    shirt that he wore next his skin, it was so soft that it fitted him like the\n    skin of an onion, and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the\n    women who beheld it. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, that I\n    do not know whether Odysseus wore these clothes when he left home, or whether\n    one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his voyage; or\n    possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a present of them, for\n    he was a man of many friends and had few equals among the Achaeans. I myself\n    gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful purple mantle, double lined, with a\n    shirt that went down to his feet, and I sent him on board his ship with every\n    mark of honor. He had a servant with him, a little older than himself, and I\n    can tell you what he was like; his shoulders were hunched, he was dark, and he\n    had thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates, and Odysseus treated him with\n    greater familiarity than he did any of the others, as being the most\n    like-minded with himself.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"249\" unit=\"line\"/>Penelope was moved still more deeply as she\n    heard the indisputable proofs [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêmata</term>] that\n    Odysseus laid before her; and when she had again found relief in tears she said\n    to him, \"Stranger, I was already disposed to pity you, but henceforth you shall\n    be honored and made welcome in my house. It was I who gave Odysseus the clothes\n    you speak of. I took them out of the store room and folded them up myself, and\n    I gave him also the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never\n    welcome him home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that\n    detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"261\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Odysseus answered, \"Lady, wife of\n    Odysseus, do not disfigure yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your\n    loss, though I can hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her\n    husband and borne him children, would naturally be grieved at losing him, even\n    though he were a worse man than Odysseus, who they say was like a god. Still,\n    cease your tears and listen to what I can tell. I will hide nothing from you,\n    and can say with perfect truth that I have lately heard of Odysseus as being\n    alive and on his way home [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>]; he is in the\n    district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] of the Thesprotians, and is\n    bringing back much valuable treasure that he has begged from one and another of\n    them; but his ship and all his crew were lost as they were leaving the\n    Thrinacian island, for Zeus and the sun-god were angry with him because his men\n    had slaughtered the sun-god's cattle, and they were all drowned to a man. But\n    Odysseus stuck to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the\n    Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the immortals, and who treated him as though\n    he had been a god, giving him many presents, and wishing to escort him home\n    safe and sound. In fact Odysseus would have been here long ago, had he not\n    thought better to go from land to land gathering wealth; for there is no man\n    living who is so wily [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>] as he is; there is\n    no one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all this,\n    and he swore to me - making drink-offerings in his house as he did so - that\n    the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would take Odysseus to\n    his own country. He sent me off first, for there happened to be a Thesprotian\n    ship sailing for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium, but he showed me all\n    the treasure Odysseus had got together, and he had enough lying in the house of\n    king Pheidon to keep his family for ten generations; but the king said Odysseus\n    had gone to <placeName key=\"perseus,Dodona\">Dodona</placeName> that he might\n    learn Zeus’ mind from the high oak tree, and know whether after so long an\n    absence he should return to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>\n    openly or in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is\n    close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer; nevertheless I will\n    confirm my words with an oath, and call Zeus who is the first and mightiest of\n    all gods to witness, as also that hearth of Odysseus to which I have now come,\n    that all I have spoken shall surely come to pass.

His grandmother\n    Amphithea threw her arms about him, and kissed his head, and both his beautiful\n    eyes, while Autolykos desired his sons to get dinner ready, and they did as he\n    told them. They brought in a five year old bull, flayed it, made it ready and\n    divided it into joints; these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces\n    and spitted them; they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round.\n    Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted, and\n    every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the sun set\n    and it came on dark, they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"426\" unit=\"line\"/>When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn,\n    appeared, the sons of Autolykos went out with their hounds hunting, and\n    Odysseus went too. They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached\n    its breezy upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the\n    fields, fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Okeanos, they came to a\n    mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the beast\n    they were chasing, and after them came the sons of Autolykos, among whom was\n    Odysseus, close behind the dogs, and he had a long spear in his hand. Here was\n    the lair of a huge boar among some thick brushwood, so dense that the wind and\n    rain could not get through it, nor could the sun's rays pierce it, and the\n    ground underneath lay thick with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the\n    men's feet, and the hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him,\n    so rushed from his lair, raised the bristles on his neck, and stood at bay with\n    fire flashing from his eyes. Odysseus was the first to raise his spear and try\n    to drive it into the brute, but the boar was too quick for him, and charged him\n    sideways, ripping him above the knee with a gash that tore deep though it did\n    not reach the bone. As for the boar, Odysseus hit him on the right shoulder,\n    and the point of the spear went right through him, so that he fell groaning in\n    the dust until the life went out of him. The sons of Autolykos busied\n    themselves with the carcass of the boar, and bound Odysseus’ wound; then, after\n    saying a spell to stop the bleeding, they went home as fast as they could. But\n    when Autolykos and his sons had thoroughly healed Odysseus, they made him some\n    splendid presents, and sent him back to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName> with much mutual good will. When he got back, his father\n    and mother were rejoiced to see him, and asked him all about it, and how he had\n    hurt himself to get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when\n    he was out hunting with Autolykos and his sons on Mount Parnassus.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"467"},{"n":"467","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"467\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"467\" unit=\"line\"/>As soon as Eurykleia had got the scarred limb\n    in her hands and had well hold of it, she recognized it and dropped the foot at\n    once. The leg fell into the bath, which rang out and was overturned, so that\n    all the water was spilt on the ground; Eurykleia's eyes between her joy and her\n    grief filled with tears, and she could not speak, but she caught Odysseus by\n    the beard and said, \"My dear child, I am sure you must be Odysseus himself,\n    only I did not know you till I had actually touched and handled you.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"476\" unit=\"line\"/>As she spoke she looked towards Penelope, as\n    though wanting to tell her that her dear husband was in the house, but Penelope\n    was unable to look in that direction and observe what was going on, for Athena\n    had diverted her attention [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>]; so Odysseus\n    caught Eurykleia by the throat with his right hand and with his left drew her\n    close to him, and said, \"Nurse, do you wish to be the ruin of me, you who\n    nursed me at your own breast, now that after twenty years of wandering I am at\n    last come to my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven\n    to recognize me, hold your tongue, and do not say a word about it any one else\n    in the house, for if you do I tell you - and it shall surely be - that if\n    heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors, I will not spare you,\n    though you are my own nurse, when I am killing the other women.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"491\" unit=\"line\"/>\"My child,\" answered Eurykleia, \"what are you\n    talking about?

Then Penelope began talking\n    to him and said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"509\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Stranger, I should like to speak with you\n    briefly about another matter. It is indeed nearly bed time - for those, at\n    least, who can sleep in spite of sorrow. As for myself, a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> has given me a life of such unmeasurable woe [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>], that even by day when I am attending to my\n    duties and looking after the servants, I am still weeping and lamenting during\n    the whole time; then, when night comes, and we all of us go to bed, I lie awake\n    thinking, and my heart becomes prey to the most incessant and cruel tortures.\n    As the dun nightingale, daughter of Pandareus, sings in the early spring from\n    her seat in shadiest covert hid, and with many a plaintive trill pours out the\n    tale how by mishap she killed her own child Itylos, son of king Zethos, even so\n    does my mind toss and turn in its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my\n    son here, and safeguard my substance, my bondsmen, and the greatness of my\n    house, out of regard to the opinion of the <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>\n    and the memory of my late husband, or whether it is not now time for me to go\n    with the best of these suitors who are wooing me and making me such magnificent\n    presents. As long as my son was still young, and unable to understand, he would\n    not hear of my leaving my husband's house, but now that he is full grown he\n    begs and prays me to do so, being incensed at the way in which the suitors are\n    eating up his property. Listen, then, to a dream that I have had and interpret\n    it for me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of\n    a trough, and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great eagle came\n    swooping down from a mountain, and dug his curved beak into the neck of each of\n    them till he had killed them all. Presently he soared off into the sky, and\n    left them lying dead about the yard; whereon I wept in my room till all my\n    maids gathered round me, so piteously was I grieving because the eagle had\n    killed my geese. Then he came back again, and perching on a projecting rafter\n    spoke to me with human voice, and told me to leave off crying. ‘Be of good\n    courage,’ he said, ‘daughter of Ikarios; this is no dream, but a vision of good\n    omen that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors, and I am no\n    longer an eagle, but your own husband, who am come back to you, and who will\n    bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On this I woke, and when I looked\n    out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as usual.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"554\" unit=\"line\"/>\"This dream, lady,\" replied Odysseus, \"can\n    admit but of one interpretation, for had not Odysseus himself told you how it\n    shall be fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended, and not one single\n    one of them will escape.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"559\" unit=\"line\"/>And Penelope answered, \"Stranger, dreams are\n    very curious and unaccountable things, and they do not by any means invariably\n    come true. There are two gates through which these insubstantial fancies\n    proceed; the one is of horn, and the other ivory. Those that come through the\n    gate of ivory are fatuous, but those from the gate of horn mean something to\n    those that see them. I do not think, however, that my own dream came through\n    the gate of horn, though I and my son should be most thankful if it proves to\n    have done so. Furthermore I say - and lay my saying to your heart - the coming\n    dawn will usher in the ill-omened day that is to sever me from the house of\n    Odysseus, for I am about to hold a tournament [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>] of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the court,\n    one in front of the other, like the stays upon which a ship is built; he would\n    then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the whole twelve. I shall\n    make the suitors try to perform the same feat [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>], and whichever of them can string the bow most easily, and\n    send his arrow through all the twelve axes, him will I follow, and quit this\n    house of my lawful husband, so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so,\n    I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"582"},{"n":"582","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"582\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"582\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Odysseus answered, \"my lady wife of\n    Odysseus, you need not defer your tournament [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>], for Odysseus will return ere ever they can string the bow,\n    handle it how they will, and send their arrows through the iron.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"588\" unit=\"line\"/>To this Penelope said, \"As long, sir, as you\n    will sit here and talk to me, I can have no desire to go to bed.
