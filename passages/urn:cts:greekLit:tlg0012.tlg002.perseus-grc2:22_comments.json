He will now pick up the arrows, one by one, and shoot them at the suitors. And he starts by taking aim at Antinoos. In Plato’s <em>Ion</em>, this moment is treated as the greatest of all scenes pictured in Homeric poetry. In a conversation with the rhapsode Ion, who specializes in the performance of Homeric poetry, Plato’s Socrates is making a mental list of what he considers to be the greatest Homeric scenes. First place in the list goes to the moment that we see here at the beginning of Rhapsody 22, where Odysseus stands at the threshold and pours the arrows from his quiver. This moment in the <em>Odyssey</em>, as we see in the order of mention by Plato’s Socrates, outranks even the greatest moment in the <em>Iliad</em>, which gets only second place. The Iliadic moment is where Achilles lunges at Hector, evidently for the last time. And third place goes to any one of those moments in the <em>Iliad</em> where Andromache or Hecuba or Priam, in that order, are shown lamenting. In this mental list of Plato’s Socrates, we see two examples of <em>fear</em> or <em>terror</em> and one combined example of <em>pity</em>—two emotions that are considered to be primary in tragedy as analyzed by Aristotle in his <em>Poetics</em>. I quote here the relevant wording, where Plato’s Socrates is speaking directly to the Homeric rhapsode Ion (Plato <em>Ion</em> 535b–c): </p><p>ΣΩ.

That is, each one of them was ‘making likenesses’ <em>in his own mind</em>. They made things up in their own minds, and these things were not just illusions: they were delusions. They were still imagining that Odysseus was a mere beggar, since he had up to now <em>looked like</em> a beggar. The likeness of Odysseus to a beggar made the suitors imagine something different than what was really happening. They imagined that the shooting of Antinoos must have been a grotesque accident. After all, how would a mere beggar dare to shoot the best of the Achaeans in Ithaca? The suitors’ mistaken way of thinking shows a lack of the mental qualities it would take to recognize Odysseus as the true king, as the best of the Achaeans. By the time Odysseus reveals himself as his true self, it is too late for the suitors. Possession of the mental qualities that they would have needed to have—but did not have—for a timely recognition of Odysseus is expressed here by way of the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’, O.22.032. This verb, derived from <em>nóos</em>, which means basically ‘mind, way of thinking’, signals the capacity to recognize what is true. Such a capacity is characteristic of Alkinoos, who ‘notices’ things about the disguised Odysseus, as expressed by way of the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ at O.08.094 and at O.08.533, where the power of this king to ‘notice’ is what leads ultimately to the self-revelation of Odysseus to the Phaeacians in <em>Odyssey</em> 8. See the comments at O.08.094 and at O.08.533; see also the anchor comment at I.05.669 on noeîn ‘take note (of), notice’. Relevant also is the note at I.13.726–735 about a generalizing statement that is made in those lines: it is said there that a person’s <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, I.13.732, is what enables him or her to ‘recognize’, <em>gignōskein</em>, I.13.734; see also the comment at O.17.292. In the case of Alkinoos, his mental power to ‘notice’ is the motivation for his “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), <em>alkí-noos</em>, ‘he who has the power [<em>alk</em>- as in <em>alkē</em> ‘power’] of mind [<em>nóos</em>]’. By contrast with Alkinoos, whose “speaking name” is positive, Antinoos as the worst of the suitors has a “speaking name” that is negative: <em>antí-noos </em>‘he who has a mind [<em>nóos</em>] that is opposed [<em>anti</em>]’. The opposition between the meanings of these two names may also go deeper, involving the root *<em>nes</em>- in the older sense of ‘return to life and life’: Alkinoos had the mental power to promote such a return, whereas Antinoos was in the end powerless to prevent it (on this point, see also H24H 10§10).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.31-22.33","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Alkinoos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Antinoos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"speaking name\" (nomen loquens)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"noeîn ‘take note (of), notice’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"'best of the Achaeans'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eïskein ‘make likenesses, liken’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.246945","title":"Odyssey 22.131","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning and uses of piphauskesthai, here in the sense of ‘reveal through speech’ (in the context of analyzing the semantic and formal confusion of piphaskein and piphauskesthai)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.131","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.246991","title":"Odyssey 22.171-22.177","body":"<p>analysis of the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey (vs. in the Iliad) and the muting of the mēnis theme in it, here especially regarding the suitors, their relatives, and Odysseus and his family</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.171-22.177","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.247039","title":"Odyssey 22.203","body":"<p>On the infusion of strength as by way divinely breathing it into the hero and thus reminding him of his own <em>menos</em> in the sense of his ‘power’, see the comments at I.11.508, I.15.059–060, I.15.262.

There is considerable emphasis on the terror and suffering of these wretched women as they get strung up in a row, twisting and turning in their agony, O.22.471–473. Those who participate in the execution are Telemachus, the cowherd Philoitios, and the swineherd Eumaios; Odysseus too is present. Then at O.22.474–479 follows the punishment of the goatherd Melanthios: his nose and his ears are chopped off, then his genitalia are ‘pulled out’, to be fed to the dogs, and then, finally, his hands and his feet are also chopped off. After these torments, it appears that he is left still alive. Participating in this horrific retribution are the cowherd Philoitios and the swineherd Eumaios. It is not clear in this case whether Telemachus is also participating, but it is clear enough from O.22.479 that Odysseus is no longer present. In any case, as I noted in the anchor comment at O.18.085–087 with specific reference to the extreme cruelty involved in the punishment of the goatherd, an explanation is needed for understanding how the supposedly righteous adherents of Odysseus could inflict horrors that were parallel to the horrors inflicted by the mysteriously infernal Ekhetos, as recounted in ghastly detail at O.18.085–087. In the anchor comment, I already indicated that at least one part of the explanation may involve the words of Antinoos at O.21.300–301 concerning a comparable mutilation inflicted on the Centaur Eurytion. But we are still left with the moral problem of the extreme cruelty at work here. Addressing this problem, I now turn to another part of my explanation, which involves what I described in the comment at I.23.001–064 as <em>a dynamic tension between dysfunctionality in the heroic world of myth and functionality in the post-heroic world of ritual</em>. I find it significant, in this regard, that the main agents of extreme cruelty in the narrative about the punishment inflicted on Melanthios are herdsmen, just as Melanthios himself is a herdsman. This pastoral context is relevant, I think, to the cruelty described in the narrative of O.22.474–479, which takes place in the festive setting of a festival that is sacred to Apollo. This festival, after all, is a pastoral celebration, centering on the sacrifice of a hundred cattle. For further pastoral details, I refer again to the anchor comment at O.20.276–280 on the festival of Apollo. But this festival as narrated here in Rhapsody 22 is not yet a ritually correct event: a correction can come about only in the post-heroic age, when the pollutions of the heroic age that happen in myth, including all the horrific cruelty, are purified year after year, into eternity, by way of festive re-enactment in ritual. The pastoral festivities of a festival of Apollo in the post-heroic world of ritual can now transcend the horrors that still pollute the heroic world of myth. But the first steps in purifying the pollution are already being taken in the myth, since Odysseus insists on the fumigation of his household in the aftermath of all the carnage. In my overall explanation, I have been emphasizing the festivities that mark the occasion of any festival, and this emphasis is relevant to a most telling insight shown by Plato when he looks into one of the most horrific of all narratives in Greek mythology. I am thinking here of the myth about Marsyas, a satyr who was an ultimate master in the art of playing the double-reed known as the <em>aulos</em>. According to this myth, Marsyas was skinned alive by the god Apollo, that ultimate master in the art of playing the lyre known as the <em>kitharā</em>. In Plato’s <em>Symposium</em> 2015a–b, we can see how the extreme violence of Apollo in the world of myth, where he strips the skin from the body of Marsyas, is counterbalanced by the festive merriment of discovering what is under the skin of Marsyas in the world of ritual. In the passage that I have just cited from the <em>Symposium</em>, the speaker is Alcibiades, and he is comparing the external ugliness of Socrates to that of Marsyas—but here the focus is on the Marsyas of ritual, not of myth. As we now learn, there used to be a festive custom of making hollow figurines of Marsyas that contained in the inside the smaller figurines of gods. I infer that the defining god that was hidden in the inside of Marsyas was Apollo himself, so that, when you peeled off the Marsyas on the outside of the figurine, you found the god Apollo on the inside. Thus, the grim violence of the myth is purified here in the festive merriment of a ritual celebrating Apollo. There could be many parallels I could draw from other festive customs as we find them world-wide—perhaps my favorite is what I could fancifully call the “John Barleycorn Syndrome”—but I content myself here with presenting my formulation in its most basic form. Of course, the shock of the violence in myth remains, and I cannot exorcise it in my own mind, but at least it is expurgated by the merriment in ritual. A similar explanation could be attempted in the case of those wretched women who were caught in that snare, O.22.471–473, since they are compared to <em>kikhlai</em> ‘thrushes’ and <em>peleiai</em> ‘pigeons’ at O.22.468. These birds get comparably snared—but the difference is, they are caught in order to be cooked and eaten as delicacies.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.437-22.479","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Apollo and Marsyas"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"festival of Apollo"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dysfunctionality in myth vs. functionality in ritual"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Eurytion the Centaur"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ekhetos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Melanthios the goatherd"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"the disloyal handmaidens"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.248173","title":"Odyssey 22.441-22.473","body":"<p>analysis of the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey (vs. in the Iliad) and the muting of the mēnis theme in it, here especially regarding the suitors, their relatives, and Odysseus and his family</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.441-22.473","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.248219","title":"Odyssey 22.474-22.477","body":"<p>analysis of the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey (vs. in the Iliad) and the muting of the mēnis theme in it, here especially regarding the suitors, their relatives, and Odysseus and his family</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.474-22.477","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.248265","title":"Odyssey 22.481","body":"<p>analysis of the passages in the Odyssey that imply that a basic component of the story of Odysseus’ return, the massacre of the suitors, is a variant of the mēnis theme</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:22.481","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.248313","title":"Odyssey 22.498","body":"<p>The women who were loyal to Odysseus, now that he has emerged victorious, weep with joy as they embrace him.
