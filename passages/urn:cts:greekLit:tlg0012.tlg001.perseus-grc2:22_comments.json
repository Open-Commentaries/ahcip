Achilles shows him no mercy, expressing the most brutal thoughts even before he vengefully finishes off the killer of Patroklos. Hector is forced to know in advance, before he loses consciousness to the death blow from Achilles, that his executioner intends to mutilate his corpse instead of allowing for a proper funeral. And the form of this mutilation is particularly horrific and morally shocking: attaching the body of Hector to the back of his chariot, Achilles will drag it around the walls of Troy for all to see the humiliation of his hated enemy. Is there any hope, then, for transcending such degradation? Only divine intervention, in the story yet to be told, could prevent the disfigurement of a heroic body’s beauty in death. But the story of transcendence must wait. For now, the focus is on the horror and the sorrow of a heroic death as seen through the eyes of Hector’s lamenting widow Andromache.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/30_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_187_x_256.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman. <br/><a>Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.1-22.515","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171187","title":"Iliad 22.57-22.58","body":"<p>examples of the identical contexts in which eukhos and kudos occur</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.57-22.58","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171232","title":"Iliad 22.57-22.58","body":"<p>comparison of this verse with I.05.654, 11.445, and 16.625, where kudos could fit the metric just as well as eukhos, and the analysis of the meaning of eukhos in this verse</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.57-22.58","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171278","title":"Iliad 22.61","body":"<p>analysis of semantic overlap between perfect oida and aorist eidon</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.61","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171341","title":"Iliad 22.67","body":"<p>application of the epithet ōmēstēs to Achilles alone among Homeric heroes, otherwise to beasts, as in this verse</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.67","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171388","title":"Iliad 22.104","body":"<p>analysis of the formulaic references to atasthaliai as indicating the responsibility of a whole group for what it suffers in the Iliad vs. the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.104","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171433","title":"Iliad 22.104","body":"<p>example of laos as referring to one’s own even with ōlese</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.104","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171479","title":"Iliad 22.107","body":"<p>example of laos as referring to one’s own even with ōlese</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.107","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.171528","title":"Iliad 22.110","body":"<p>Hector is well aware that he may die at the hands of Achilles, but he wishes to die in a way that will assure him of having the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry, and such ‘genuine’ glory, as marked by the prefix <em>eü</em>- of the adverb <em>eü-kleiōs</em> ‘with the genuine glory [<em>kleos</em>] (of poetry)’, is simultaneously ‘good’ glory, as also in the case of the adjective <em>esthlon</em> ‘genuine, good’ as epithet of <em>kleos</em> at I.18.121.

Here at I.22.395–405, Achilles proceeds to subject the body of Hector to an act that is meant to disfigure it, and the Master Narrator hints at his own moral disapproval by referring to this act as <em>aeikea</em> . . . <em>erga</em> ‘things unseemly’, I.22.395. The generalized idea of ugliness as conveyed by <em>aeikea</em> ‘unseemly’ and other such words in Homeric diction is reciprocal: when you do something ugly to someone, making that someone look ugly, you are thereby making yourself look ugly as well. To be specific, I describe here in detail the ugly things that Achilles will now do to Hector. First, he pierces a hole between the ankle and the heel of Hector’s two feet, and then he threads through these two holes a leather strip that he attaches to the back of his chariot, I.22.396–398. Then he will drag the corpse through the dust and grime of the battleground as he mounts the chariot and drives off at top speed, with Hector in tow. At this horrific moment in the Homeric narrative, feelings of pity are prompted by the narrative itself at I.22.401–403. The Master Narrator prompts his listeners by focusing here on Hector’s hair, once so beautifully groomed but now all disheveled, and then on his head, with a face that was once so charming to look at—but now you expect this beautiful head to be mutilated beyond recognition, once it gets dragged over the harsh and scraping surface of the battleground. The Master Narrator concludes ruefully: the god Zeus himself is allowing all this to happen, I.22.403–404. But what is the god really allowing to happen? So far, there has been a mistreatment and even degradation of Hector’s body, yes. But, at least so far, there has been no disfigurement to be seen. As the Master Narrator takes one last look here at the corpse of Hector, the hero’s head is shrouded in a swirl of dust, I.22.405, and so his face is not visible. The next time the Master Narrator looks at the corpse of Hector, Achilles is displaying the body lying face down in the dust, I.23.024–026, near the stand where the dead body of Patroklos is lying in state, obviously face up. For a preview of this later moment, see the comment on 1.23.1–64. Even there at 1.23.1–64, though, it cannot be known whether the body that Achilles is intending to degrade has in fact already been disfigured. Once again, the face is not visible. At a later point, however, at I.23.184–191, it will become clear that the face and the head and in fact the whole body of Hector cannot be disfigured. The body is saved. In the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, there will be an analysis of this vision of salvation for Hector’s body.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.395-22.405","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"dragging of Hector"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aeike- ‘unseemly’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mistreating the corpse of Hector"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.172642","title":"Iliad 22.429","body":"<p>in a list of parallels to the opening of formula (A) hōs ephat’ eukhomenos… occurring in the last 9 books of the Iliad (with participles after phanai categorizing the speech, here as lament), in the context of analyzing formula (A) and the meaning of eukhesthai</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.429","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.172688","title":"Iliad 22.433-22.435","body":"<p>in a list of passages where mortals are compared to gods (in the context of analyzing Arete’s comparison to a god/Athena Polias)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.433-22.435","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.172741","title":"Iliad 22.437–475","body":"<p>Although Priam and Hecuba, the parents of Hector, have already seen with horror and sorrow what has happened to him at the hands of Achilles, Andromache does not yet know, I.22.437–439.

And, like Helen, she is not pictured as singing while weaving: rather, she weaves her song into the web that she pattern-weaves. The song that she weaves into her web is pictured as <em>throna</em>, which can mean ‘flower patterns’ or ‘love charms’. It can be argued that both meanings apply in the present context. A similar argument can be made in the case of the epithet <em>poikilo-thronos</em> applied to the goddess Aphrodite in Sappho Song 1.1: this word can mean either ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] flower patterns [that are pattern-woven on your robe]’ or ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] love charms’. See further at MoM 2§76 (also PasP 101n40). Further, at I.22.441, there exists a variant epithet for the web that Andromache weaves: this <em>diplax</em> ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’ is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. And we find the same variation of epithets for the web that Helen weaves at I.03.126: this <em>diplax</em> too is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. Similarly, the antux ‘rim’ that is being made for the Shield of Achilles at I.18.479 is described as triplax ‘threefold’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ at I.18.480. In Eustathius <em>Commentary on the Iliad</em> vol. 4 p. 218 lines 14–17, the commentator draws attention to the morphological parallelism of <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’ with <em>diplax</em> ‘twofold’. So, Eustathius recognizes here a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. See the comment on I.18.479–480. See also the comment on I.09.130, where it is argued that the craft of pattern-weaving by Aeolian women is linked with the power of the craft of Homeric poetry to make contact with the Bronze Age. Finally, in the case of the two textual variants <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ as applied to the web of Helen at I.03.126 and to the web of Andromache at I.22.441, we learn from the scholia for I.03.126 that <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ happened to be the reading preferred by all three major Alexandrian editors of Homer—Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Aristarchus (see also HPC 274nn3, 4).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.440-22.441","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"marmareē ‘gleaming’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"pattern-weaving"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"diplax ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"porphureē ‘purple’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"huphainein ‘weave’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"throna ‘flower patterns; love charms’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.172981","title":"Iliad 22.441","body":"<p>This word <em>en-passein</em> ‘sprinkle’ conveys a metaphor for the process of pattern-weaving.

Earlier, in an analogous context at I.06.389, Andromache is pictured as ‘looking like a woman possessed’ (μαινομένῃ ἐϊκυῖα) when she rushes toward the walls of Troy to see for herself the fate of the Trojans on the battlefield. In the case of the present context, I.22.460, the comparison of Andromache to a maenad is relevant to the undoing of her hair when her elaborate headdress falls from her head at the moment when she goes into a swoon, I.22.468–472. The undoing of a maenad’s hair is a traditional Dionysiac theme, as we see for example in a painting on a vase made in Athens sometime in the decade of 480–470 BCE (Munich, Antikensammlungen no. 2416): this painting shows a maenad transfixed by the gaze of Dionysus, who is looking directly into her eyes, and the maenad’s loose strands of flowing curls of hair are seen cascading down from behind her ears at either side of her head garlanded with the ivy of Dionysus. As we look at the maenad’s hair coming undone, we see a distinctive sign of her starting to lose control to Dionysus, of becoming possessed by Dionysus, of surrendering the self to Dionysus. See also Nagy 2007c:252–253, citing further examples from the visual arts. Andromache looks similarly maenadic when she falls into a swoon, I.22.466–467, while at the same time letting her elaborate headdress fall from her head to the ground, I.22.468–470. What follows is an epitome of further analysis in Nagy 2007c:249–251. In the dramatic context of Andromache’s swoon, I draw attention to the evocative word <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’, I.22.470. It refers to the overall ornamental hair-binding that holds together three separate kinds of ornamental hair-binding that serve to keep Andromache’s hair in place, under control, I.22.469: in this verse, the three separate terms for ornamental hair-bindings are <em>ampux</em> ‘frontlet’, <em>kekruphalos</em> ‘snood’, and <em>anadesmē</em> ‘headband’. The overall hair-binding or ‘headdress’ that keeps it all in place is the <em>krēdemnon</em>, I.22.470. Similarly, Varro (<em>On the Latin language</em> 5.130) speaks of three separate terms for ornamental hair-bindings traditionally used by Roman matrons: lanea ‘woolen ribbon’, reticulum ‘net-cap’ or ‘snood’, and capital ‘headband’. To these three words Varro (7.44) adds a fourth, tutulus (derived from the adjective tutus ‘providing safety’), which seems to be an overall term for the generic headdress worn by brides and Vestal Virgins as well as matrons. When Andromache lets drop from her head her elaborate <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’, I.22.470, thus causing her hair to come completely undone, she is ritually miming her complete loss of control over her own fate as linked with the fate of her husband: we see here a ritually eroticized gesture that expresses her extreme sexual vulnerability as linked with the violent death and degradation of her husband. For Andromache to do violence to her own <em>krēdemnon</em> is to express the anticipated violence of her future sexual humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Pointedly, the goddess Aphrodite herself had given this <em>krēdemnon</em> to Andromache on her wedding day, I.22.470–471 (further analysis by Dué 2006:4, 78). Another example of such ritual miming is the moment in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, verses 40–42, when Demeter tears off her <em>krēdemnon</em> in reacting to the violation of her daughter Persephone by Hādēs. The explicit association of the <em>krēdemnon</em> with Aphrodite reveals its erotic properties. The undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I will call an Aphrodisiac effect. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon</em> is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. This ritual symbolism is part of a “cultural grammar of hair” (Levine 1995:95). Such a “grammar” helps explain why the virginal Nausikaa would not think of going out in public without first putting on her <em>krēdemnon</em>, O.06.100. She won’t leave home without wearing her headdress. Her gesture here is hardly a signal of being married. Clearly, she is unmarried. So, we see that unmarried women as well as married women like Andromache wear the <em>krēdemnon</em> in public. The gesture is simply a signal of propriety. Such a “grammar” is in fact typical of the Mediterranean world in general. A striking point of comparison is the figure of the <em>sotah</em> ‘errant woman’ in Hebrew Bible traditions, who is marked by the ritual dishevelment of her hair (<em>Numbers</em> 5:11–31). In this case, the ‘errant woman’ is a foil for the properly married woman.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.460-22.474","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"krēdemnon ‘headdress’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Andromache as maenad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mainás ‘maenad’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.173156","title":"Iliad 22.476–515/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 2","body":"<p>See also anchor comment at I.06.407–439 on: three laments by Andromache, part 1, and anchor comment at I.24.723–746 on: three laments by Andromache, part 3.</p><p>In the first lament of Andromache for Hector, as we saw in the anchor comment at I.06.407–439, she was already lamenting the death of Hector before he was even dead. As for her second lament, here at I.22.476–515, she sings it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for her third lament, to be featured at I.24.723–746, Andromache will sing it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. The second lament here is in some ways a preview of the third, which as we will see is technically the most formal of Andromache’s three laments. The beginning of Andromache’s second lament is signaled here at I.22.476 by the technical poetic term <em>amblēdēn</em>, an adverb that means ‘making a start [in performance]’ just as the adverb <em>hupoblēdēn</em> at I.01.292 means ‘continuing [in response]’. As Andromache starts to sing her second lament, the word that refers here at I.22.476 to the form of her singing is the verb <em>goân</em> ‘make lament’, corresponding to the noun <em>góos</em> ‘lament’. We have already seen the noun <em>góos</em> at I.18.051, with reference to the lament sung by Thetis for the future death of Achilles. This form of lament, <em>góos</em>, is conventionally sung by female members of the bereaved family, and there will be more to say about this form in the comment on I.24.720–776. For the moment, however, I focus on what happens after Andromache has finished singing her lament at I.22.476–514. Now the Trojan women who are attending her respond to her lament by continuing it with their own lament, in antiphonal performance, at I.22.515: ‘So she [= Andromache] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). The antiphonal refrain here at I.22.515 is signaled by the verb <em>epi–stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’, matching the antiphonal refrain at I.19.301 in response to the lament of Briseis. See the anchor comment at I.19.282–302. So, the second lament of Andromache, as we see it come to a conclusion at I.22.515, is a classic example of a group performance as rounded out by way of an antiphonal refrain. For more on such group performance, see again the anchor comment on I.19.282–302, where it is emphasized that Briseis the Aeolian is featured as a distinctly choral personality, analogous to the personality of Sappho herself in the choral songs attributed to that Aeolian prima donna of a later era.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.476-22.515","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"epi–stenakhesthai ‘wail in response’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"amblēdēn ‘making a start’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"góos ‘lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"goân ‘make lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.173205","title":"Iliad 22.483","body":"<p>In the lament of Andromache, she refers here at I.22.483 to the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ that the death of Hector has caused her.

As noted already in the comment on I.06.402–403, the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. This meaning is relevant to the heroic role of the father as <em>protecting a citadel from sieges</em>. This role is expressed by the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Hector, <em>Héktōr</em>, which is an agent noun meaning ‘one who holds [<em>ekhein</em>]’. The translation ‘hold’ here conveys the sense of ‘uphold, protect, guard’: so Hector’s name destines him to be the ‘protector’ of the city of Troy. See the comment on I.05.473–474. The name of Hector is relevant to the fact that Hector’s son is named after him. More than that, Hector’s son is named after the primary function of Hector as signaled by the father’s name, and the rationale for that naming is made explicit at I.22.506–507: as Andromache says to her dead husband here, Astyanax is named Astyanax or ‘king of the city’ precisely because his father was protector of the city. Here is the wording at I.22.507: ‘because you [= <em>Héktōr</em>], all by yourself, protected [<em>eruesthai</em>] for them [= the Trojans] the gates and the walls [of their city]’ (οἶος γάρ σφιν ἔρυσο πύλας καὶ τείχεα μακρά). We see at work here the mythological convention of naming a son after a primary heroic trait of the father, as in the case of the son of Ajax, whose name <em>Eurusakēs</em> means ‘the one with the wide shield [<em>sakos</em>]’; this meaning is made explicit in the wording of Sophocles Ajax 574–578. In the case of Hector’s name as <em>Hék-tōr</em> or ‘protector’, there is a serious danger portended by his function as protector of the citadel of Troy: this heroic function of Hector makes him a rival of the goddess Athena in her own divine function as protector of the same citadel of Troy. See the comment on I.06.286–311, especially with reference to the epithet of Athena as <em>erusi-ptolis</em> ‘protector of the citadel [<em>p(t)olis</em>]’ at I.06.305.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:22.506-22.507","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"antagonism between immortal and mortal"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Astyanax"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Hector"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"speaking name\" (nomen loquens)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ekhein ‘hold; protect’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.173377","title":"Iliad 22.514","body":"<p>Reaching the end of her lament for Hector, Andromache declares ruefully: all that Hector cares about is whether the men and women of Troy will in the end think of him as a hero who deserves to have the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry.
