[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.120429","title":"Iliad 12","body":"<p>At the very beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 12, we modern readers may find that we have suddenly hit a wall—the Achaean Wall. It seems difficult for us to understand what the Master Narrator of the <em>Iliad</em> is really saying when he foretells the future destruction or deconstruction of this structure. And the main obstacle to our understanding here is not the presence of the Achaean Wall in the <em>Iliad</em> but rather its foretold absence—after all is said and done in the narrative. For the ancients who heard the Iliad narrated to them, by contrast, the future absence of the Achaean Wall was perfectly understandable <em>in terms of the narration itself</em>. And that is because the Master Narrator presupposes that there is no Achaean Wall to be seen in the Trojan landscape at the time of narration. Such a presupposition shapes the narrative of <em>Iliad</em> 12—and in fact it shapes the whole narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>. The setting for this narrative remains the world of heroes, which is larger-than-life because it is situated in the heroic past, but the setting for the actual narration of this narrative is the post-heroic world of a present time as figured by the Master Narrator himself. The staging of the heroic world by the Master Narrator is comparable to what is called the <em>mise-en-scène</em> in the traditions of French theater and film. And the predominant feature of the Iliadic <em>mise-en-scène</em> or scenery is the Achaean Wall, not the Trojan Wall. That is why the building of this structure by the Achaeans in Iliad 7 had been opposed by the gods Poseidon and Apollo, the original builders of the Trojan Wall. But the Achaean Wall needed to be built by the Achaeans to protect them and their ships from the fire of Hector—which would not be threatening them if Achilles had not been insulted by Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 1. If we think of the overall plot of the <em>Iliad</em> as a scenario, then the Achaean Wall can be seen as an integral feature of the scenery for this scenario.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RP-P-OB-16.043.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>“Siege of the Greek Camp.” Crispijn van de Passe (I) (1613).

Forces of nature can have a mind of their own, as it were, because they are connected to the mental power of divinities who control the cosmos and to whom humans using their own mental power can pray for the activation of such control. Besides rivers, as here, other natural forces that have <em>menos</em> include the sun (I.23.190), fire (I.06.182, I.17.565), and winds (O.19.440).

These heroes are called <em>hēmitheoi</em> ‘demigods, half-gods’ here at I.12.023, and we find no other attestation of this word <em>hēmitheoi</em> in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em>: in both epics, the word for ‘heroes’ is consistently <em>hērōes</em>. Unlike <em>hēroēs</em>, the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> is appropriate to a style of expression that looks beyond epic. The use of this word to mark the Achaean heroes here belongs not to the epic tradition of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> but to alternative poetic traditions having to do with cosmogony and anthropogony, as we see when we consider the attestations of <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Hesiodic poetry, F 204.100 and <em>Works and Days</em> 160; relevant too are the attestations of this word in the poetry of the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, 31.19 and 32.19 (Nagy 2006 §66). In the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>, 160, the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> signals the last generation of heroes, who were obliterated in the time of the Theban and the Trojan Wars, 161–165, but who were preserved after death and immortalized by being transported to the Islands of the Blessed, 167–173. It can be said in general that the theme of heroic immortalization is central to myths and rituals related to hero cult, and so the use of the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> ‘demigods’ in this Hesiodic context is highly significant (<em>The Best of the Achaeans</em> 342-343): yes, all epic heroes must die, but then, by way of becoming cult heroes, they are mystically immortalized after death (Nagy 2006 §§80–108). And the significance of such a theme is further heightened by the idea of divine parentage as built into the meaning of word <em>hēmitheoi</em> as ‘half-gods’, which shows a genetic understanding of the hero. The heroic potential is programmed by divine genes, as it were. There has to be a god involved in any hero’s “family tree.” Still, the literal meaning of the word <em>hēmitheos</em> as ‘half-god’ does not imply an exact half-and-half distribution of immortals and mortals in a hero’s genealogy. Rather, this meaning marks a tenuous balancing of immortality with mortality in the hero’s self. In the case of the hero Achilles, for example, the divinity of his mother is not the only ‘half’ of immortality that he inherits, since his mortal father Peleus is descended, by way of that man’s own mortal father Aiakos, from the immortal father Zeus himself. But the bitter fact remains that Peleus is a mortal. And, since Peleus as one of the two parents of Achilles is mortal, Achilles must be mortal as well, even though his other parent is Thetis, who is not only immortal but even endowed with limitless cosmic powers (<em>The Best of the Achaeans</em> 346–347). So Achilles, despite the limitless potential he inherits from Thetis, is subject to death. The same can be said about all other Homeric heroes: even though they are all descended in some way or another from the gods, they are all mortals. They all have to die, like ordinary mortals. No matter how many immortals you find in a heroic “family tree,” the intrusion of even a single mortal will make all successive descendants mortal. Mortality, not immortality, is the dominant gene (GN 2006 §70). So, the meaning of <em>hēmitheoi</em> as ‘half-gods’ can cut both ways: the ‘half-divinity’ of the hero can point downward to the grim facts of mortality just as it can point upward to the sublime hopes for immortalization after death. The scenario of obliteration followed by immortalization for the <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Hesiodic poetry, <em>Works and Days</em> 161–173, must be contrasted with the scenario of obliteration followed by no mention of immortalization for the <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Homeric poetry, I.12.17–33. The inevitability of death for the hero enhances the pathos of hoping for immortalization after death. Such a pathos is visible in the exceptional Homeric occurrence of <em>hēmitheoi</em> at I.12.023, where we see a correspondingly exceptional shift in the Homeric narrative perspective: instead of viewing heroes through the lens of the heroic age, seeing them as they were back then, alive and hoping to be remembered, the poetry now views them through the lens of a post-heroic age, seeing them as already dead and hopefully immortalized after death (Nagy 2006 §67).</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:12.23","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achaean Wall"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hero cult"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hēmitheoi ‘demigods; half-gods’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.121312","title":"Iliad 12.40","body":"<p>analysis of the application of isos Arēi (and variants) to heroes in their aristeiai and of the use of isos aellēi/lailapi in these contexts</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:12.40","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.121360","title":"Iliad 12.70","body":"<p>comment on the Achaeans as potentially nōnumnoi if they were destroyed at Troy without succeeding to capture the city, the same term as used of the Bronze Generation in Hesiod, W&D 146-155</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:12.70","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"nōnumnoi ‘nameless’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.121412","title":"Iliad 12.076","body":"<p>In the immediate context, the plural <em>therapontes</em> functions as a virtual synonym of a word used elsewhere, <em>hēni-okhoi</em> ‘chariot drivers’.</p><p>For a complete list of Iliadic occurrences of <em>therapōn</em>, see the comment on I.01.321.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:12.76","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"hēni-okhos ‘chariot driver’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"therapōn 'attendant, ritual substitute'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.121462","title":"Iliad 12.090","body":"<p>Here is the first explicit reference to the objective of the Trojans to break through the Wall of the Achaeans.

The other instances of <em>alēthēs</em> show that it qualifies (the content of) speech, indicating that it denotes truthfulness in the sense of not forgetting what has been said in an uninterrupted continuum of time, and not letting anything slip by one without being mindful of its implications (and indeed, <em>a-lēthēs </em>and <em>a-lētheia </em>are to be understood in opposition to <em>lēthē</em>). Here, however, it can be seen to be applied by a logical extension to the agent of such communication, and so, to indicate the woman’s scrupulousness in her business transactions (so Cole).</p><p>Insofar as the simile and the wool-weighing woman illustrates the balance of the battle between the Greeks and the Trojans, there is a further dimension to her being <em>alēthēs</em>. The balance of and then the change in a battle is often represented through the image of Zeus weighing the two sides in scales (e.g. I.8.69-74, I.16.658, I.19.223-224, I.22.209-213), and this image of Zeus can be seen to be implied here, too, even if it is not explicitly presented as such: in lines 437-438 Zeus gives the upper hand to Hektor. Detienne argues that this image reflects the idea of the archaic king pronouncing justice, with which scales are likewise associated: such pronouncements of justice by the king are just and <em>alēthēs</em>. The model for this king is Zeus in his role of administering justice and judging between two sides, using his scales – and so the adjective is appropriate here, too, signaling the divine justness and <em>alētheia</em> of the judgement weighed in the scales. The application of the adjective <em>alēthēs </em>explicitly to the woman within the simile, then, presents her in the role of Zeus as a divine judge, transferring to the vehicle an attribute of the tenor. And the idea of <em>pronouncing</em> such judgements brings <em>alēthēs</em> here, too, back to the sphere of communication that excludes forgetting, ignoring, and failing to notice by its opposition to <em>lēthē</em>.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Cole, Thomas. 1983. “Archaic Truth.” <em>Quaderni Urbinati di cultura classica</em> n.s. 13:7-28.</p><p>Detienne, Marcel. 1973. <em>Les maîtres de vérité dans la Grèce archaïque</em>.
