There a fire was kindled for her by her waiting-woman, Eurymedusa, an aged dame from Apeire. Long ago the curved ships had brought her from Apeire,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>and men had chosen her from the spoil as a gift of honor for Alcinous, for that he was king over all the Phaeacians, and the people hearkened to him as to a god.

For I am come hither a stranger sore-tried<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>from afar, from a distant country; wherefore I know no one of the people who possess this city and land.”\n    Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Then verily, Sir stranger, I will shew thee the palace as thou dost bid me, for it lies hard by the house of my own noble father.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>Only go thou quietly, and I will lead the way. But turn not thine eyes upon any man nor question any, for the men here endure not stranger-folk, nor do they give kindly welcome to him who comes from another land.

But when they had come to the glorious palace of the king, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:\n    “Here, Sir stranger, is the house which thou didst bid me shew to thee, and thou wilt find the kings, fostered of Zeus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"50\" unit=\"line\"/>feasting at the banquet. Go thou within, and let thy heart fear nothing; for a bold man is better in all things, though he be a stranger from another land.

But with Periboea lay Poseidon and begat a son, great-hearted Nausithous, who ruled over the Phaeacians; and Nausithous begat Rhexenor and Alcinous. Rhexenor, when as yet he had no son, Apollo of the silver bow smote<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"65\" unit=\"line\"/>in his hall, a bridegroom though he was, and he left only one daughter, Arete.

There is an isle, Ogygia, which lies far off in the sea.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"245\" unit=\"line\"/>Therein dwells the fair-tressed daughter of Atlas, guileful Calypso, a dread goddess, and with her no one either of gods or mortals hath aught to do; but me in my wretchedness did fate bring to her hearth alone, for Zeus had smitten my swift ship with his bright thunderbolt,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"250\" unit=\"line\"/>and had shattered it in the midst of the wine-dark sea.

She took me to her home with kindly welcome, and gave me food, and said that she would make me immortal and ageless all my days; but she could never persuade the heart in my breast. There for seven years' space I remained continually, and ever<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"260\" unit=\"line\"/>with my tears would I wet the immortal raiment which Calypso gave me. But when the eight year came in circling course, then she roused me and bade me go, either because of some message from Zeus, or because her own mind was turned. And she sent me on my way on a raft, stoutly bound, and gave me abundant store<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"265\" unit=\"line\"/>of bread and sweet wine, and clad me in immortal raiment, and sent forth a gentle wind and warm. So for seventeen days I sailed over the sea, and on the eighteenth appeared the shadowy mountains of your land; and my heart was glad,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"270\" unit=\"line\"/>ill-starred that I was; for verily I was yet to have fellowship with great woe, which Poseidon, the earth-shaker, sent upon me.

Forth then I staggered, and sank down, gasping for breath, and immortal night came on. Then I went forth from the heaven-fed river,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"285\" unit=\"line\"/>and lay down to sleep in the bushes, gathering leaves about me; and a god shed over me infinite sleep.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"287"},{"n":"287","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"287\">\n    <p>So there among the leaves I slept, my heart sore stricken, the whole night through, until the morning and until midday; and the sun turned to his setting<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> ere sweet sleep released me.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"290\" unit=\"line\"/>Then I saw the handmaids of thy daughter on the shore at play, and amid them was she, fair as the goddesses.
