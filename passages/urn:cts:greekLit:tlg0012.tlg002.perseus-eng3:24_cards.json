Did Poseidon smite you on board your ships,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"110\" unit=\"line\"/>when he had roused cruel winds and long waves?

Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came, as the seasons rolled on, as the months waned and many days were brought in their course, even then one of her women who knew all, told us,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>and we caught her unravelling the splendid web. So she finished it against her will perforce.\n    “Now when she had shewn us the robe, after weaving the great web and washing it, and it shone like the sun or the moon, then it was that some cruel god brought Odysseus from somewhere<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>to the border of the land, where the swineherd dwelt.

Then he went and stood on the threshold, and poured out the swift arrows, glaring about him terribly, and smote king Antinous.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"180\" unit=\"line\"/>And thereafter upon the others he with sure aim let fly his shafts, fraught with groanings, and the men fell thick and fast.

Then they sat down in order beside Dolius, their father.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"412"},{"n":"412","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"412\">\n    <p>\n    So they were busied with their meal in the halls; but meanwhile Rumor, the messenger, went swiftly throughout all the city, telling of the terrible death and fate of the wooers.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>And the people heard it all at once, and gathered from every side with moanings and wailings before the palace of Odysseus. Forth from the halls they brought each his dead, and buried them; and those from other cities they sent each to his own home, placing them on swift ships for seamen to bear them,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>but they themselves went together to the place of assembly, sad at heart. Now when they were assembled and met together Eupeithes arose and spoke among them, for comfortless grief for his son lay heavy on his heart, even for Antinous, the first man whom goodly Odysseus had slain.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>Weeping for him he addressed their assembly and said:\n    “Friends, a monstrous deed has this man of a truth devised against the Achaeans. Some he led forth in his ships, many men and goodly, and he has lost his hollow ships and utterly lost his men; and others again has he slain on his return, and these by far the best of the Cephallenians.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay then, come, before the fellow goes swiftly to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011036\">Pylos</placeName> or to goodly <placeName key=\"tgn,5001986\">Elis</placeName>, where the Epeans hold sway, let us go forth; verily even in days to come shall we be disgraced forever. For a shame is this even for men that are yet to be to hear of, if we shall not<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>take vengeance on the slayers of our sons and our brothers. To me surely life would then no more be sweet; rather would I die at once and be among the dead. Nay, let us forth, lest they be too quick for us, and cross over the sea.”\n    So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans. Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>from the halls of Odysseus, for sleep had released them; and they took their stand in the midst, and wonder seized every man. Then Medon, wise of heart, spoke among them:\n    “Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay, I myself saw an immortal god, who stood close beside Odysseus, and seemed in all things like unto Mentor. Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; and they fell thick and fast.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"450"},{"n":"450","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"450\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all. Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he alone saw before and after: he with good intent addressed their assembly, and said:\n    “Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Through your own cowardice, friends, have these deeds been brought to pass, for you would not obey me, nor Mentor, shepherd of the people, to make your sons cease from their folly. They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>of a prince, who, they said, would never more return. Now then be it thus; and do you hearken to me, as I bid. Let us not go forth, lest haply many a one shall find a bane which he has brought upon himself.”\n    So he spoke, but they sprang up with loud cries, more than half of them, but the rest remained together in their seats;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>for his speech was not to their mind, but they hearkened to Eupeithes, and quickly thereafter they rushed for their arms. Then when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they gathered together in front of the spacious city. And Eupeithes led them in his folly,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>for he thought to avenge the slaying of his son; yet he was himself never more to come back, but was there to meet his doom.\n    But Athena spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, saying: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, tell to me that ask thee what purpose thy mind now hides within thee.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>Wilt thou yet further bring to pass evil war and the dread din of battle, or wilt thou establish friendship betwixt the twain?”\n    Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, why dost thou ask and question me of this? Didst thou not thyself devise this plan,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>that verily Odysseus should take vengeance on these men at his coming? Do as thou wilt, but I will tell thee what is fitting. Now that goodly Odysseus has taken vengeance on the wooers, let them swear a solemn oath, and let him be king all his days, and let us on our part<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>bring about a forgetting of the slaying of their sons and brothers; and let them love one another as before, and let wealth and peace abound.”\n    So saying, he roused Athena, who was already eager, and she went darting down from the heights of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>.\n    But when they had put from them the desire of honey-hearted food,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was the first to speak among his company, saying: “Let one go forth and see whether they be not now drawing near.”\n    So he spoke, and a son of Dolius went forth, as he bade; he went and stood upon the threshold, and saw them all close at hand, and straightway he spoke to Odysseus winged words:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>“Here they are close at hand. Quick, let us arm.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"496"},{"n":"496","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"496\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and they rose up and arrayed themselves in armour: Odysseus and his men were four, and six the sons of Dolius, and among them Laertes and Dolius donned their armour, grey-headed though they were, warriors perforce.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they opened the doors and went forth, and Odysseus led them.\n    Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad at sight of her,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"505\" unit=\"line\"/>and straightway spoke to Telemachus, his dear son:\n    “Telemachus, now shalt thou learn this—having thyself come to the place of battle, where the best warriors are put to the trial—to bring no disgrace upon the house of thy fathers, for we have ever excelled in strength and in valor over all the earth.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"510\" unit=\"line\"/>And wise Telemachus answered him: “Thou shalt see me, if thou wilt, dear father, in my present temper, bringing no disgrace upon thy house, even as thou sayest.”\n    So said he, and Laertes was glad, and spoke, saying: “What a day is this for me, kind gods!<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>Verily right glad am I: my son and my son's son are vying with one another in valor.”\n    Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said: “Son of Arceisius, far the dearest of all my friends, make a prayer to the flashing-eyed maiden and to father Zeus, and then straightway raise aloft thy long spear, and hurl it.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>So spoke Pallas Athena, and breathed into him great might. Then he prayed to the daughter of great Zeus, and straightway raised aloft his long spear, and hurled it, and smote Eupeithes through the helmet with cheek-piece of bronze. This stayed not the spear, but the bronze passed through,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>and he fell with a thud, and his armour clanged about him. Then on the foremost fighters fell Odysseus and his glorious son, and thrust at them with swords and double-pointed spears. And now would they have slain them all, and cut them off from returning, had not Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>shouted aloud, and checked all the host, saying:\n    “Refrain, men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, from grievous war, that with all speed you may part, and that without bloodshed.”\n    So spoke Athena, and pale fear seized them. Then in their terror the arms flew from their hands<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"535\" unit=\"line\"/>and fell one and all to the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice, and they turned toward the city, eager to save their lives. Terribly then shouted the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and gathering himself together he swooped upon them like an eagle of lofty flight, and at that moment the son of Cronos cast a flaming thunderbolt,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>and down it fell before the flashing-eyed daughter of the mighty sire. Then flashing-eyed Athena spoke to Odysseus saying:\n    “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, stay thy hand, and make the strife of equal<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> war to cease, lest haply the son of Cronos be wroth with thee, even Zeus, whose voice is borne afar.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"545\" unit=\"line\"/>So spoke Athena, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart. Then for all time to come a solemn covenant betwixt the twain was made by Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
