These dwelt of old in spacious Hypereia<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"5\" unit=\"line\"/>hard by the Cyclopes, men overweening in pride who plundered them continually and were mightier than they. From thence Nausithous, the godlike, had removed them, and led and settled them in <placeName key=\"tgn,7010886\">Scheria</placeName> far from men that live by toil. About the city he had drawn a wall, he had built houses<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>and made temples for the gods, and divided the ploughlands; but he, ere now, had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and Alcinous was now king, made wise in counsel by the gods. To his house went the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, to contrive the return of great-hearted Odysseus.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>She went to a chamber, richly wrought, wherein slept a maiden like the immortal goddesses in form and comeliness, Nausicaa, the daughter of great-hearted Alcinous; hard by slept two hand-maidens, gifted with beauty by the Graces, one on either side of the door-posts, and the bright doors were shut.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"20\" unit=\"line\"/>But like a breath of air the goddess sped to the couch of the maiden, and stood above her head, and spoke to her, taking the form of the daughter of Dymas, famed for his ships, a girl who was of like age with Nausicaa, and was dear to her heart. Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>“Nausicaa, how comes it that thy mother bore thee so heedless? Thy bright raiment is lying uncared for; yet thy marriage is near at hand, when thou must needs thyself be clad in fair garments, and give other such to those who escort thee. It is from things like these, thou knowest, that good report goeth up among men,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>and the father and honored mother rejoice. Nay, come, let us go to wash them at break of day, for I will follow with thee to aid thee, that thou mayest with speed make thee ready; for thou shalt not long remain a maiden. Even now thou hast suitors in the land, the noblest<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"35\" unit=\"line\"/>of all the Phaeacians, from whom is thine own lineage. Nay, come, bestir thy noble father early this morning that he make ready mules and a wagon for thee, to bear the girdles and robes and bright coverlets. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"40\" unit=\"line\"/>to go thus than on foot, for the washing tanks are far from the city.”\n    So saying, the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, departed to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, where, they say, is the abode of the gods that stands fast forever. Neither is it shaken by winds nor ever wet with rain, nor does snow fall upon it, but the air<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"45\" unit=\"line\"/>is outspread clear and cloudless, and over it hovers a radiant whiteness.

The mother sat at the hearth with her handmaidens, spinning the yarn of purple dye, and her father she met as he was going forth to join the glorious kings<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>in the place of council, to which the lordly Phaeacians called him. But she came up close to her dear father, and said:\n    “Papa dear, wilt thou not make ready for me a wagon, high and stout of wheel, that I may take to the river for washing the goodly raiment of mine which is lying here soiled?<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"60\" unit=\"line\"/>Moreover for thyself it is seemly that when thou art at council with the princes thou shouldst have clean raiment upon thee; and thou hast five sons living in thy halls—two are wedded, but three are sturdy bachelors—and these ever wish to put on them freshly-washed raiment,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"65\" unit=\"line\"/>when they go to the dance.

Alone the daughter of Alcinous kept her place, for<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>in her heart Athena put courage, and took fear from her limbs.

Then among the maidens spoke goodly Odysseus: “Maidens, stand yonder apart, that by myself I may wash the brine from my shoulders, and<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>anoint myself with olive oil; for of a truth it is long since oil came near my skin. But in your presence will I not bathe, for I am ashamed to make me naked in the midst of fair-tressed maidens.”\n    So he said, and they went apart and told the princess.

But when we are about to enter the city, around which runs a lofty wall,—a fair harbor lies on either side of the city and the entrance is narrow, and curved ships<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"265\" unit=\"line\"/>are drawn up along the road, for they all have stations for their ships, each man one for himself.
