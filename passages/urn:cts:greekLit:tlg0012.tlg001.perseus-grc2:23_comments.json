A high point of the funeral in <em>Iliad</em> 23 is a spectacular chariot race arranged by Achilles to honor his dead comrade Patroklos. But an earlier high point is a comparably spectacular cremation of his friend’s body. But this cremation of Patroklos, as a ritual, is far from perfect: it is in fact polluted, and the pollution will make Achilles look bad, at least for the moment. The polluted thoughts of the hero, as evidenced by his dragging the corpse of Hector behind his speeding chariot, will drive him to extremes that will challenge the cosmic order. But the Master Narrator of the <em>Iliad</em> will remedy the pollution, and the remedy will take the form of actually narrating the grim story. In the process of this narration, a great lesson will be learned about life, death, and a hoped-for recovery of life. </p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/32_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_189_x_383_mm_1280.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Achilles dragging the body of Hector.

The Myrmidon warriors are to mourn Patroklos while driving their chariots around his dead body three times, I.23.007–009, I.23.013–014, after which they are to unharness the chariots and join in a funeral feast arranged by Achilles. The ritual act of mourning while driving, as performed by the Myrmidons, is described overall as a <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, I.23.010, for which Achilles himself is the principal performer, as signaled by the verb <em>arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’, I.23.012. The words of his lead-off lament are quoted at I.23.019–023. In this lament, Achilles addresses the dead Patroklos and repeats to him at I.23.20–23 the two deeds that he had promised at I.18.334–337 to perform before the funeral could take place. First, Achilles had promised to bring back, together with the dead body of Hector, the armor that Hector had stripped from the dead body of Patroklos, and now he reiterates that promise, adding two ghastly details about the dead body of Hector: he has dragged the corpse behind his chariot and intends to feed it to the dogs, I.23.021. And, second, Achilles had also promised to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths on the funeral pyre of Patroklos and then to cremate their bodies together with the body of Patroklos himself, I.23.022–23. After repeating these promises to Patroklos within the wording of his quoted lament, I.23.020–023, Achilles now prepares for the funeral feast—but not before displaying the dead body of Hector, lying face down in the dust, I.23.024–026, next to the stand where the dead body of Patroklos is lying in state. Then, after the Myrmidons unharness their chariots, I.23.026–027, they sit down next to the ship of Achilles in order to partake of the feast, I.23.028, and the slaughter of the sacrificial animals to be eaten at the funeral feast gets underway, I.23.029–034. Nothing is said here about cooking the meat. Instead, the last thing said about this funeral feast of the Myrmidons is that the blood flowing from the mass slaughter of sacrificial animals is streaming all around the corpse of Patroklos, I.23.034. It seems as if the Myrmidons were feasting on raw meat, just as their leader Achilles had expressed the ghastly desire to cut up the mortally wounded Hector and to eat him raw, I.22.346–347. See the comment on I.22.346–348. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Achaeans come to the ship of Achilles and persuade him, with some difficulty, to leave behind the funeral feast of the Myrmidons and to come along with them to the headquarters of Agamemnon, I.23.035–038, where the order is given to prepare for Achilles some hot water for him to wash off all the blood that still covers him, I.23.039–041. Evidently, Agamemnon is preparing for an all-Achaean feast to be attended by Achilles, who is now expected to wash up before the feast begins. And it is only at this moment that we see for the first time that Achilles is still covered in gore. The blood of all the Trojans he has slaughtered on the battlefield is still on him and with him. Already before, Achilles must have been covered in gore when he had hosted the feast for that sub-set of Achaeans who were his own people, the Myrmidons. Back then, neither Achilles nor any of his Myrmidons had washed off the human blood of the killing fields before the shedding of the animal blood at the sacrifice that preceded their funeral feast. But now, for the all-Achaean feast, Achilles is expected to wash up. Not surprisingly, Achilles refuses, declaring at I.23.043–044 that he will remain covered with gore and will refrain from washing off the blood until he performs three sacred tasks. He now names these tasks at I.23.045–046: first, he will cremate Patroklos, I.23.045, and, second, he will make a tumulus that will be a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ for Patroklos, I.23.045, and, third, he will at an earlier point cut off a long lock of his own hair as a sacrifice to be burned on the funeral pyre of his friend, I.23.046. That said, however, Achilles goes on to urge Agamemnon to continue with the plan for an all-Achaean feast, I.23.048—provided that the Achaeans follow up on their nighttime feasting by going out next morning in order to gather firewood for constructing the funeral pyre that will be used for the cremation of Patroklos, I.23.049–053. The Achaeans proceed to indulge in their feasting and then return to their shelters for a night’s sleep, I.23.054–058, while Achilles goes off without having had anything to eat, mourning Patroklos, and he finds a solitary spot on the beach, where he lies down, exhausted, and falls into a deep sleep, I.23.059–064. What will happen next, at I.23.071-076, is the apparition of the spirit of Patroklos. Before commenting on the apparition scene, however, I must pause to note that the narrative has already indicated five salient points of dysfunctionality in the preparations of Achilles for the funeral of Patroklos:</p><p>Point 1. The intent of Achilles to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths as a human sacrifice is understood to be ritually incorrect. See the comment on I.23.163–183. And the fact that he will go through with it and will actually perform the deed will in retrospect be understood to be morally incorrect as well. See the comment on I.23.163–183. In myth, human sacrifice is a pollution, both ritually and morally. And such pollution is typical of what can perhaps best be described as a traditional pattern of dysfunctionality in myth—as opposed to functionality in ritual, where animal sacrifice is understood to be a salvific replacement of human sacrifice. As we see from the myth of Pelops as narrated in Pindar’s <em>Olympian</em> 1, for example, the slaughtering of Pelops is a dysfunctional sacrifice in the heroic world of myth, but it becomes an aetiology for the functional sacrifice of rams in the post-heroic world of ritual as practiced in Olympia during the archaic and Classical periods and beyond (detailed analysis in PH 116–135). In this connection, I offer a working definition of aetiology (background in PH 118, 125–130; 141–142; 386; 395–397; also Nagy 2011a§68):<em> an aetiology focuses on a foundational catastrophe in the mythologized past that explains and thus motivates continuing success in the ritualized present and future</em>.</p><p>Point 2. The dragging of Hector’s corpse by Achilles is likewise understood to be ritually incorrect, and such incorrectness is in this case noted by Homeric poetry, which signals also the moral incorrectness of mistreating a corpse. See the comment on I.23.163–183. Here I invoke a general principle at work in myths about ancient Greek heroes: <em>whenever heroes commit deeds that clearly violate moral codes, such deeds are not condoned by the heroic narrative</em>. See <a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5943\">H24H 1§52</a>, where I work out an analysis of such a principle, to be summarized in this formulation: <em>the pollution of a hero in myth is relevant to the worship of that hero in ritual</em>. Especially relevant to this formulation, as we will see in later comments, are myths that aetiologize rituals of seasonally recurring athletic competitions: the ritual of competing in an athletic event is thought to purify the original pollution of the hero in myth (analysis in H24H 7a§14).</p><p>Point 3. The intent of Achilles to feed Hector’s corpse to dogs and birds is clearly understood to be a blatant abomination both ritually and morally. In this case, however, Achilles will never get to perform such a horrific deed.</p><p>Point 4. There is something wrong about the funeral feast of the Myrmidons as arranged by Achilles. The blood of sacrifice is not offset here by any mention of cooking the meat to be eaten. </p><p>Point 5. Achilles is ritually incorrect in not purifying himself of human blood before he undertakes the three ritually correct actions of cutting his hair, cremating the body of Patroklos, and entombing his bones.</p><p>All five of these points, as we will see retrospectively in the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, are examples of <em>pollution</em>.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.1-23.64","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dysfunctionality in myth vs. functionality in ritual"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"preparing for the funeral of Patroklos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.173758","title":"Iliad 23.12","body":"<p>This word <em>arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ refers here to the performance of lament as song correlated with dance, and Achilles is the lead performer here.

But what does the <em>psūkhē</em> really want for itself? I ask the question this way in order to highlight a basic fact about the use of the word <em>psūkhē</em> in Homeric diction: as a disembodied conveyor of identity after death, the <em>psūkhē</em> is distinct from the body once the body is no longer alive. In view of this distinction, the answer to the question I just posed is partly evident—but also partly mystical. Here is my formulation of the answer: what the <em>psūkhē</em> really wants for itself is to be reunited with the body, and such a reunion must be achieved by way of a proper funeral. The part that is mystical about this formulation is the fact that the very idea of a proper funeral is a ritual construct that fits the mythological construct of the <em>psūkhē</em>. The ritual must be done right, and then the myth of the <em>psūkhē</em> will turn out to be right. So, it is imperative for Achilles to get things right in preparing a proper funeral for Patroklos. And how will Achilles make sure that the funeral of Patroklos is a proper funeral? Most important, there must be a ritually correct entombment, I.23.071, and a vital part of this entombment will be the actual cremation of the corpse, I.23.070–071 / I.23.076. Before cremation of the corpse, the <em>psūkhē</em> as a ‘spirit’ that used to belong to the body will be haunting the world of the living, but, after cremation, there will be no more haunting, I.23.075–076. So, what will happen to the <em>psūkhē</em> after cremation of the body? It is often assumed by readers of these verses at I.23.071-076 that the <em>psūkhē</em> as ‘spirit’, once the body is cremated, will now simply join the other <em>psūkhai</em> or ‘spirits’ who are already in Hādēs, and that will be the end of that. But the original Greek wording does not say that. In my opinion, what it really says gets misunderstood. What follows is a reinterpretation of I.23.071–076, divided into ten points:</p><p>Point 1. I start with evidence from Homeric poetry about the underworld known as Hādēs. I argue that Hādēs is a zone of transition for the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ as it journeys from the Far West to the Far East. In this mystical zone, <em>psūkhai</em> can get lost along the underworld pathways leading from west to east, and then they will wander around, but they can also find the way, and, from the very start, the right way can be achieved by way of cremation. There will be much more to say about Hādēs in comments on the <em>Odyssey</em>. For now, however, it is enough to say at least this much more on the basis of the internal evidence of I.23.071–076: without a proper cremation and entombment, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos will not achieve safe passage through Hādēs. I make a special point here of saying <em>through</em> Hādēs and not <em>to</em> Hādēs. As I will argue further in comments on the <em>Odyssey</em>, Homeric poetry treats Hādēs as something that is <em>transitional</em>, not <em>eschatological</em>. In the Iliadic passage that is now being analyzed, I.23.071–076, even the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ is something that is ultimately transitional in its own right.</p><p>Point 2. At I.23.073, it is said that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos is not allowed by the other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ to join them ‘on-the-other-side-of [<em>huper</em>] the river [<em>potamos</em>]’ (ὑπὲρ ποταμοῖο), and that is why it is then said at I.23.074 that the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is left to wander all over the realm of Hādēs. The point is, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is already in Hādēs, wandering around, and thus his <em>psūkhē</em> is not being excluded from Hādēs by the other <em>psūkhai</em>. Rather, as I argue here, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is being excluded from joining other <em>psūkhai</em> who are no longer wandering around in Hādēs.</p><p>Point 3. And why are these other <em>psūkhai</em> no longer wandering around? It is because they have already found the way to get to the other side of the <em>potamos</em> ‘river’, I.23.073. And what is ‘the river’ here? In terms of Homeric poetry, this river must be the world-enclircling fresh-water stream named Ōkeanos, which as we saw in the comment on I.07.421–423 is a boundary delimiting light from darkness, wakefulness from sleep, life from death. The sun rises from the Ōkeanos at sunrise in the Far East, as we see at I.07.421–423, just as it sets into it at sunset in the Far West, as we see at I.08.485–486. And the movement of the sun both into and out from the Ōkeanos in the Far West and in the Far East respectively is envisioned as a cosmic model for an alternation between darkness and light, between sleep and awakening, between death and revival from death. </p><p>Point 4. This model is most relevant to what is meant when the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos says at I.23.073 that the other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ do not allow his spirit to join them ‘on-the-other-side-of [<em>huper</em>] the river [<em>potamos</em>]’ (ὑπὲρ ποταμοῖο). In this case, I argue, the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos is imagined as separating the dead from the living in the Far East, where the sun rises, not in the Far West, where the sun sets.</p><p>Point 5. Correspondingly, the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hādēs mentioned at I.23.071 are situated in the Far East, where the sun rises, not only in the Far West, where the sun sets. In support of this interpretation, I note that the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hādēs at I.23.071 can be seen as a by-form of the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hēlios the Sun, mentioned at I.24.012. See also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on: Gates of Hādēs. (Further analysis in GMP 225–226.)</p><p>Point 6. If, then, the Gates of Hādēs are the Gates of the Sun, then I can make more sense of what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’of Patroklos is saying at I.23.071, where this spirit expresses its desire to pass through the Gates of Hādēs. I argue that the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos here is seeking passage through the gates of Hādēs that are situated in the Far East, where the sun rises, not through the gates that are situated in the Far West, where the son sets. See also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on: Gates of Hādēs.</p><p>Point 7. Similarly, the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos seeks to cross the world-encircling cosmic river in the Far East, not in the Far West. Whereas the other side of the river in the Far West is the zone of Hādēs from the standpoint of the living, the other side of the same river in the Far East is a mystical place beyond the zone of Hādēs—from the standpoint of the dead who are still wandering around in Hādēs but who seek a renewal of life. As the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos says at I.23.074, his spirit is still wandering around in the zone of Hādēs. And that is because his body has not yet received the ritual of cremation, which as we will now see will lead to a recovery of life after death.</p><p>Point 8. The scenario that I have put together here is based not only on the internal evidence of the wording at I.23.071–076 and elsewhere in Homeric poetry. It is based also on the comparative evidence of cognate Indic traditions centering on rituals of cremation as correlated with myths about a recovery of life after death. There is a detailed survey in the essay “Patroklos, Concepts of Afterlife, and the Indic Triple Fire,” GMP 85–121 (the essentials can be found at pp. 87, 115–121). In terms of Indic ritual and myth, cremation leads to a reunion: once the cremation takes place, the spirit without body and the body without spirit can now be reunited, and, this way, the dead can now be revived after death. Further, such a revival results in the reunion of the revived dead with the already revived <em>pítṛ</em>-s or ‘ancestors’. It is most relevant to note here that the Indic word <em>pítṛ</em>- ‘ancestor’ is cognate with the Greek word <em>Patro</em>- in the name <em>Patrokléēs</em>, which means ‘he who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors [<em>pateres</em>]’: thus the role of Patroklos in instructing Achilles about the vital importance of cremation is in and of itself a deeply traditional theme. </p><p>Point 9. On the basis of both the internal and the comparative evidence that I have assembled so far, my formulation about the the ritual of cremation as visualized in myth can now be extended. In this extended formulation, I start with a scenario that reconstructs the initial phase of what happens to the <em>psūkhē</em> after the body is successfully cremated:</p><p>After a successful cremation, the <em>psūkhē</em> will cease wandering around in  Hādēs and will now find its way out. The <em>psūkhē</em> will cross the world- encircling river in the Far East and pass through the Gates of Hādēs,  which are the Gates of the Sun, <em>just as the sun passes through these same  gates when it rises at sunrise</em>.  </p><p>Point 10. I now continue with a scenario that reconstructs the next phase of what happens to the <em>psūkhē</em> after the body is successfully cremated. In this case, I find no internal evidence in Homeric poetry, and so I turn to the comparative evidence of Vedic poetry in Indic traditions, which show at least the broad outlines. From here on, since I now rely primarily on the Indic comparanda, I will no longer say <em>psūkhē</em> but simply ‘spirit’, which can serve as an adequate translation for both the Greek word and the corresponding Indic word, <em>mánas</em>-. This Indic word refers to the breath of life that leaves the body at death and is destined to be mystically reintegrated with the body after cremation. That said, I resume the scenario: </p><p>After finding its way out of the lower world, the spirit follows the path of  the sun and joins the rising sun at sunrise, ascending into the skies and  seeking to be reunited there with the body. Meanwhile, the body has  already been vaporized by way of cremation, and its fumes ascend into  the skies, seeking to be reunited there with the spirit.  </p><p>Such a prospective reunion of spirit and body is the secret of immortalization after death, <em>and the key to that secret is the ritual of cremation</em>.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.71-23.76","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Gates of Hadēs"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hādēs"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ōkeanos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"entombment"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"cremation"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē 'spirit'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"gates of the Sun"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.174153","title":"Iliad 23.77","body":"<p>reference to Citti’s recognition of the fact that Aeschines Against Timarchus 149 contains a variant οὐ γὰρ ἔτι, which is shared by some of the city-editions of Homer (politikaí) (Citti 1966.30)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.77","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.174222","title":"Iliad 23.090","body":"<p>The spirit of the dead Patroklos is recounting how Peleus had entrusted Patroklos as a <em>therapōn</em> to Achilles.

This interwoven question at I.23.094–096 is most curious, since it is patently unjustifiable. I argue that the things intended by Achilles fail in more than one way to match the things intended by the psūkhē of Patroklos. There are two main reasons for making this argument:</p><blockquote><p>First, Achilles intends to do more than the two things that Patroklos instructs him to do. As we see at I.23.045–046, Achilles intends not only to cremate Patroklos and to entomb him but also to cut off a long lock of his own hair as a sacrifice to be burned on the funeral pyre of his friend. And he intends to do even more than that. As we see in the lament of Achilles where he addressed the dead Patroklos, he repeats to him there at I.23.20–23 the two deeds that he had promised at I.18.334–337 to perform before the funeral could take place: first, Achilles had promised to bring back, together with the dead body of Hector, the armor that Hector had stripped from the dead body of Patroklos, and, second, he had also promised to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths on the funeral pyre of Patroklos and then to cremate their bodies together with the body of Patroklos himself. And there is even more: as we see at I.22.326–330, at I.22.354, and at I.22.248 (together with I.22.354), Achilles intends to expose the body of Hector to be devoured by dogs and birds, after having degraded the corpse by dragging it behind his chariot. But the fact is, the spirit of Patroklos had not spoken to Achilles about any of these other things.</p><p>And here is the second reason for arguing that the interwoven question of Achilles at I.23.094–096 is not justifiable: the fact is, Achilles had never spoken about any intent to have himself entombed together with Patroklos when the time comes for his own funeral.

The surprise expressed by Achilles here in reacting to the realistic appearance of Patroklos recalls an earlier point in the narrative: when the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is first sighted at I.23.065, already in that first moment of its apparition, it is pictured as life-size, I.23.066—so, it is not a miniature version of the self.

In the first reference here, at I.23.125–126, it is already made clear that the place for constructing the funeral pyre that will cremate the corpse of Patroklos will be the same place where the tomb for Patroklos will also be constructed—and that this tomb will ultimately enclose not only the bones of Patroklos but also the bones of Achilles. This place is described as a lofty <em>aktē</em> ‘promontory’, I.23.125, and <em>ērion</em> is the word for the ‘tomb’ that will be prepared after the cremation, I.23.126.

And, in preparation, Achilles will cut his own golden-blond hair, I.23.141, placing into the lifeless hands of Patroklos the long lock that he shears off, I.23.152–153. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 12§26a.) The long unshorn hair of Achilles had ostentatiously signaled his pre-adult status. Once his hair is cut short, he can become an adult. In this Homeric scene, as we see Achilles standing on the heights of the promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that encloses his own body, he wistfully looks out over the seas of the outer Hellespont, fixing his gaze toward the far west, in the direction of his native land of Thessaly, and longing for the river Sperkheios that flows through that distant land: it was to the waters of that river, which he will never live to see again, that he had hoped to sacrifice his long hair after he came of age and was ready to cut it, I.23.142-153. But now Achilles cuts his long hair prematurely and unseasonally as he stands there on the promontory, I.23.142. Meanwhile, the Myrmidons led by Achilles will anticipate his example, likewise cutting their hair, I.23.135-136. (At H24H 14§26a, I need to correct what I say about I.23.135–136: it is only the Myrmidons, not the Achaeans <em>en masse</em>, who cut their hair here.) This ritual gesture of cutting the hair in mourning for Patroklos will later be extended after Achilles himself is killed: what then happens at his own funeral is that all the Achaeans, not only the Myrmidons, will join in the same gesture: as we learn at O.24.046, all the Danaoi=Achaeans will cut their hair for Achilles. But now, at I.23.138–153, Achilles himself will show the way by cutting his own hair, thus prefiguring what all the Achaeans will do <em>en masse</em> at his own funeral. <em>Do as I do</em>. Achilles shows the way to mourn him later by now cutting his own hair in mourning for his other self Patroklos. Moreover, this same ritual gesture of cutting the hair in response to the death of Achilles becomes an aetiology for explaining why it is that Greek men of the post-heroic age customarily wear their hair short, not long—except for such notable counter-examples as the Spartans. In a work of Philostratus, <em>On Heroes</em> (51.13), we read the following succinct formulation of an aetiology for this generalized Greek custom: ‘no longer could they [= the Achaeans] consider it a beautiful thing to grow their hair long, in the time after Achilles’ (οὐδὲ κομᾶν ἔτι μετὰ τὸν Ἀχιλλέα καλὸν ἡγούμενοι). In the wording of this aetiology, it is as if the death of Achilles were the single reason that explains why adult men of the post-heroic age no longer wore their hair long. It is as if all the ‘sons of the Achaeans’ were now ready to shift from pre-adult to adult status—once Achilles was dead and buried. The term ‘sons of the Achaeans’—as the Achaean warriors are conventionally described in the <em>Iliad</em> (I.01.162 and so on)—implies a pre-adult status for all those ‘boys’ who fought in the Trojan War. But now those fighting ‘boys’ of the heroic age have reached a post-heroic maturity that inaugurates a post-heroic age.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.138-23.153","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"making the funeral pyre"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles cuts his hair"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.174791","title":"Iliad 23.140-23.153","body":"<p>thematic and formal convergences of Achilles and Apollo (here, Apollo’s epithet akersekomēs as at I.20.039 and Achilles’ hairshearing in these verses)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.140-23.153","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.174858","title":"Iliad 23.140-23.153","body":"<p>commentary on xanthos in the context of immortalization</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.140-23.153","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.174918","title":"Iliad 23.140","body":"<p>Here and some fifty lines later (23.193) are the only two occurrences in the <em>Iliad</em> of the ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε (“then he/she thought of other things”) formula, which occurs with much greater frequency in the <em>Odyssey</em>. In that poem, the formula functions as a marker of a more or less significant discontinuity: a change of scene or a turn of the plot in a substantially new direction (see <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). In this instance, there is no such discontinuity, at least in terms of the scene or the forward movement of the action. Instead of a sudden departure in a new direction, we find a ‘zooming in’ on the goal of the action, from the Myrmidons as they march in Patroklos’ funeral procession to Achilles standing at the pyre. The discontinuity consists rather in the transition to a ritual act of special significance: Achilles’ dedication of the lock of hair that Peleus had vowed would be offered to the river Sperkheios on Achilles’ return to Phthia. The subsequent occurrence of the formula likewise marks the shift to an especially significant ritual act, namely, the lighting of Patroklos’ funeral pyre. The formulaic marker of discontinuity thus serves to highlight the most critical ritual moments in the otherwise continuous narrative of Patroklos’ funeral. Comparison with the usage of the formula in the <em>Odyssey</em> suggests further layers of possible meaning. At <em>Odyssey</em> 23.242, a variant of the formula occurs in a context in which, again, there is no immediately apparent discontinuity. And, again, this occurrence is followed by another a short while later (23.344). These two instances enclose what is arguably the most significant moment in the <em>Odyssey</em>: the reunion of Odysseus and Penelope, which Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus identified as the poem’s τέλος (see <em>Odyssey </em>23.242). One might similarly view the ritual act enclosed by the <em>Iliad</em>’s two occurrences of the formula as the τέλος of that poem, for, by shearing the lock of hair he had saved for Sperkheios, Achilles ritually formalizes his destiny to die at Troy. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, furthermore, the ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε formula, which is used most often with Athena as subject, serves as an index of narrative control: it highlights the fact that Athena prompts and guides the action (see <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). In <em>Iliad</em> 23, Achilles emerges as a comparable director of the action. Not only does he dictate the ritual procedures of Patroklos’ funeral; during the subsequent games he directs contests that restage, in various ways, many of the poem’s principal themes. Finally, it is tempting to draw some connection between the fact that, in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the formula is restricted to female subjects (Athena, Helen, Nausikaa, Penelope) and the fact that, in the <em>Iliad</em>, it refers exclusively to Achilles’ involvement in funerary ritual. As a mourner, Achilles participates in a sphere of action that is typically dominated by women (see Alexiou 2002 and Dué 2006: ch. 1). The application to Achilles of a formula that is otherwise associated with female actors may serve to highlight his assumption of a very different social role than he has hitherto occupied.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bibliographical References</p><p>Alexiou, M. 2002. <em>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition.</em> Rev. ed.

What follows next is a spectacular array of sacrificial offerings that are also placed on the pyre, to be burned together with Patroklos, I.166–178. The offerings include sacrificial animals that are ritually slaughtered before being placed on the pyre: included are sheep and cattle at I.23.166, horses at I.23.171–172, and dogs at I.23.173–174. And then, the last and most important of the sacrificial offerings are the twelve Trojan youths that Achilles had already promised to slaughter as a human sacrifice: Achilles will now personally cut their throats and leave their bodies to be cremated alongside Patroklos, I.23.175–178. Then, to finish off the ritual of cremation, Achilles addresses Patroklos, picturing him in the realm of Hādēs, I.23.179. Achilles boasts again, as he had done before, that he has done everything that he has promised to do, I.23.180—but the only one of those things that he now mentions here specifically is the sacrifice of the Trojan youths, I.23.181–182. There is something very wrong here, and the Master Narrator knows it. Already at I.23.176, where he highlights the moment when the Trojan youths are killed before being cremated, the Master Narrator says about Achilles: ‘and he had bad intentions in in his mind’ (κακὰ δὲ φρεσὶ μήδετο ἔργα). By intending things that look bad for his victims, he is making himself look bad. See also the comment on I.22.395–405, with reference to I.22.395. So, what makes Achilles look bad here? For an answer, I repeat what I already said at Point 1 in the comment on 1.23.01–064: the killing of the Trojan youths as a form of human sacrifice is in retrospect understood to be morally wrong. In myth, human sacrifice is a pollution. And such pollution is an instance of dysfunctionality in myth as opposed to functionality in ritual, where animal sacrifice is understood to be a salvific replacement of human sacrifice. And the idea that something is polluted in the thinking of Achilles when he slaughters the youths is linked to something else in his train of thought as he goes on to say one more thing about this killing: at least the bodies of the youths were devoured by the fire of cremation, I.23.183. But then he adds in the same train of thought: by contrast, the body of Hector will be devoured by dogs, I.23.183. So, Achilles expresses here once again a ghastly intention that he has expressed so many times before. But, this time, the expression becomes the final moment in the ritual of cremation for Patroklos. And to bring the whole ritual of cremation to such a conclusion is I think a sign of pollution. Here I find it relevant to epitomize what I already said at Points 2 and 3 in the comment on 1.23.01–064 about the mistreatment of Hector’s corpse by Achilles: <em>both the dragging of the corpse and the intent to feed it to dogs and birds are signs of pollution</em>.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.163-23.183","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"cremation of Patroklos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176191","title":"Iliad 23.170","body":"<p>analysis of the evidence of hero cult in the Iliad and the Odyssey (here, offering of honey with oil)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.170","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176236","title":"Iliad 23.182-23.198","body":"<p>analysis of allusions/references to traditions outside of the Homeric epics, here by Iliad to other epic traditions regarding the death of Achilles and his killing Memnon (Kakridis’ argument)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.182-23.198","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176319","title":"Iliad 23.184–191","body":"<p>As we will now see, the gods are well aware of the ongoing pollution, and they counteract it by way of purification, which takes the form of preserving the body of Hector from the mistreatment intended by Achilles. Right after Achilles declares once again at I.23.183 that he will expose his enemy’s body as prey to be devoured by dogs, the Master Narrator firmly contradicts him at I.23.184: no, the dogs will not be devouring the body of Hector. And why? Because the gods will not allow it. Aphrodite herself is keeping the hellish hounds away from the corpse, I.23.185–186. And the goddess is applying to Hector’s skin a salve that is <em>ambrosio</em>- ‘immortalizing’, thus keeping it intact and saving the beautiful flesh from any disfigurement—no matter how many times Achilles will drag the corpse behind his speeding chariot, I.23.186–187. (On the word <em>ambroto</em>-/<em>ambrosio</em>- in the sense of ‘immortalizing’, not ‘immortal’, see the relevant comment on I.16.670.) So, the goddess of sexual beauty has kept the naked body of Hector beautiful to the point of becoming sexually attractive: Hector is now the definitive <em>beau mort</em>, the beautiful corpse, since his dead body has been made beautiful by way of a beautiful death, <em>une belle mort</em>. (See <em>Homer the Classic</em>, 4§266, with bibliography on the French terminology; see also the relevant comment on I.17.050–060.) For the first time here at I.23.184–191, we see that the body of Hector was never even disfigured—despite the horrific visions of disfigurement that the Master Narrator allowed to be imagined at I.22.395–405 and even later at 1.23.1–64. (See especially the comment on I.22.395–405.) Now, all those darkly horrific visions of ugliness recede in the beautiful light of divine intervention. Not only does Aphrodite apply her immortalizing salve to Hector’s flesh, I.23.186–187, but Apollo does even more, enveloping the hero’s entire body in a divine glow that will shield it from all decay and pollution, I.23.188–191. And by now we can see that the action of the gods in perfectly preserving the dead body of Hector is an act of perfect purification that counteracts the self-pollution of Achilles in mistreating the corpse. We have already seen that the polluted thoughts of Achilles had even compromised the ritual of cremation for Patroklos. But now we will see that the saving of Hector’s body by the gods will lead to an overall purification that will in the course of time counteract not only the specific pollution of mistreating the corpse of Hector but also the overall pollution that has compromised the ritual of cremating the corpse of Patroklos. And the gods will accomplish this overall purification by saving Hector’s body as a ritually idealized corpse that is worthy of a ritually ideal cremation—which will actually take place in <em>Iliad</em> 24. Even before we reach the narration of that ideal cremation in <em>Iliad</em> 24, eight points need to be made already now about the picturing of Hector’s body as a ritually idealized corpse here at I.23.184–191:</p><blockquote><p>Point 1. The etymology of the noun <em>sōma</em>, conventionally translated as ‘body’, is relevant to the ritual idealization of Hector’s corpse in <em>Iliad</em> 23. To make this argument, I start by returning here to the basic idea that Hector’s corpse is ideal because it was saved for a ritually ideal cremation—and thus saved from the horrors of exposition to dogs and birds.</p><p>Point 2. That said, I propose that this idea of something that is saved matches the etymology of <em>sōma</em>, which I explain as an action-noun derived from a verb that survives as <em>sōzein</em> in classical Greek prose, meaning ‘save’. This relatively late form of the verb, <em>sōzein</em>, is already attested in Homeric poetry (as at O.05.490: σώζων), though the dominant use of the same verb in this poetry preserves an uncontracted (and thus older) shape of the root, which is <em>sa(w)o</em>- (as at I.24.035: σαῶσαι). The contracted (and thus newer) shape of the root, which is <em>sō</em>-, occurs normally in the “weak” metrical positions of the Homeric hexameter (that is, in the second long of a sequence long-long, which derives from a sequence long-short-short), but there is already an attestation of this same shape in a “strong” metrical position (that is, in the first long of a sequence long-long or in the long of a sequence long-short-short): in this case, the root is attested in the adjective <em>sōs</em>, meaning ‘safe or ‘saved’, at I.22.332 (σῶς ἔσσεσθ’). Similarly, the root of the noun <em>sōma</em> is attested in a “strong” metrical position throughout its occurrences in Homeric hexameter. In terms of my proposal, then, <em>sōma</em> was an action-noun derived from a contracted form of its verb-root: so, from <em>sō</em>-, not from <em>sao</em>-. As an action-noun derived from a verb meaning ‘save’, it would have originally meant ‘saving’ —and then later became concretized to mean ‘the thing saved’. Here is a semantic parallel: the action-noun <em>sperma</em>, derived from the verb-root <em>sper</em>- meaning ‘sow’, originally meant ‘sowing’—and then later become concretized to mean ‘a thing that is sown’, that is, ‘seed’. An ideal corpse, then, in terms of the etymology I propose, is a thing that is saved.</p><p>Point 3. In Homeric diction, this word <em>sōma</em> as applied to heroes refers to a ‘body’ that is already dead but needs to be saved from mistreatment or from dangers in general. The clearest example is at I.22.342: Hector, mortally wounded by Achilles and already on the verge of death, is making a final plea to Achilles, asking him to show mercy not to the dying Hector but to the dead Hector that he will be after he has died, and this dead Hector is called here the <em>sōma</em> of Hector. To say it another way, Achilles is asked to show mercy to the <em>sōma</em> of Hector after Hector is already dead and his body is already a corpse. That is why Hector is pleading for his <em>sōma</em> to be returned to Troy, where the Trojans can arrange for it to have the proper ritual of cremation, I.22.342–343. Such an arrangement is anticipated already at I.07.079–080.</p><p>Point 4. By making this plea, Hector is at the same time pleading for his body not to be exposed as prey for dogs to devour, I.22.339: ‘don’t let the dogs at the ships of the Achaeans ravage me’ (μή με ἔα παρὰ νηυσὶ κύνας καταδάψαι Ἀχαιῶν). Here the future corpse of Hector is starkly equated with the present self of Hector. He is not even saying here, ‘don't let the dogs devour my body’, but instead he says more simply, ‘don't let the dogs devour me’. This idea of the dead body as the self has already been highlighted in the comment at I.01.003–005.</p><p>Point 5. As for the outcome of Hector’s plea here, I have already analyzed in the comment on I.22.346–348 the savage response of Achilles, who declares his certaintly that, yes, he will expose Hector’s corpse as prey for dogs and birds to devour, I.22.248 (also I.22.354). But I concentrate here only on the wording of the original plea that provoked the response. In terms of this wording, the <em>sōma</em> is something that needs to be saved for cremation and thus saved from harm. The <em>sōma</em> must be saved. It needs salvation. And, ideally, the <em>sōma</em> is in fact saved. That is the ritualized ideal that we see reflected in the etymology, to be interpreted as ‘the thing that is saved’.</p><p>Point 6. I find it relevant to add, however, that Homeric diction can also turn the meaning of <em>sōma</em> upside down: in two contexts, I.03.023 and I.18.161, <em>sōma</em> refers to a carcass that is being devoured by a ravenous lion that holds on to it and won’t let go. For wild animals, then, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved for devouring. For humans, by contrast, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved from being devoured by wild animals—and thus saved for cremation.</p><p>Point 7. In Homeric poetry, the saving of the corpse for cremation translates into a salvation of the self by way of cremation. Hector’s cremation in the heroic age, as we will see it described in <em>Iliad</em> 24, will become a model for all cremations in the post-heroic age. And this cremation of Hector in <em>Iliad</em> 24 will undo the pollutions that had compromised the cremation of Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23. These pollutions will be purified by way of narrating the cremation of Hector, which will be done right and which will therefore be free of pollution. In the future, as the cremation of Hector demonstrates, there will be no more polluting of cremation as a ritual, as there had been at the cremation of Patroklos. No longer will there by any human sacrifices. No longer will the mistreatment of corpses be condoned. The polluting of rituals like cremation in the heroic age of myth will be superseded by the purifying of these same rituals in the post-heroic age of ritual, which is the era of the Homeric present, when rituals can be done right.</p><p>Point 8. The rituals of the post-heroic age include not only the aristocratic and vastly expensive practice of cremation. They include also the wildly popular medium of epic performance as exemplified by the Homeric poetry of the <em>Iliad</em>. If epic performance is ritualized, which is what I argue, then the actual narration of all the events that supposedly took place in the heroic age is a ritual in and of itself. And, as a ritual, epic performance can be a form of purification in its own right. Whatever events are narrated in Homeric poetry, the performance of these events, good or bad, is purified simply by way of being narrated. It is in this context that we can view the five salient points of dysfunctionality in the preparations of Achilles for the funeral of Patroklos, as listed in the comment on 1.23.01–064. In retrospect, all five of these points show examples of pollution. And all five of these examples can ultimately be counteracted by the purifying power of narration in epic performance. Epic narration can purify pollution.</p></blockquote>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.184-23.191","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"beau mort (a dead body made beautiful by way of a beautiful death; une belle mort)"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176383","title":"Iliad 23.184","body":"<p>in a list of parallels to the opening of formula (A) hōs ephat’ eukhomenos… occurring in the last 9 books of the Iliad (with participles after phanai categorizing the speech, here as threat), in the context of analyzing formula (A) and the meaning of eukhesthai</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.184","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176430","title":"Iliad 23.185-23.191","body":"<p>the need of gods to intervene in Achilles’ mistreatment of Hektor’s corpse, given the principle that mēnis against Achilles has been suspended in the Iliad</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.185-23.191","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176477","title":"Iliad 23.192","body":"<p>analysis of the theme of biē as elemental, and here specifically the representation of Achilles’ biē as parallel to that of the cosmic aspect of biē (as manifested in the thunderstorm of Zeus/Hephaistos’ fire/winds as violent storm)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.192","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176522","title":"Iliad 23.194","body":"<p>in the context of discussing ērato and Arētē</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.194","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176568","title":"Iliad 23.205-23.209","body":"<p>Memnon’s ideal suitability for the theme of immortalization and the role of Eos/Dios thugatēr in the preservation of the hero in the afterlife</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.205-23.209","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176614","title":"Iliad 23.205-23.209","body":"<p>location of the land of Aithiopes and Olympians’ habitually going there to receive sacrifice</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.205-23.209","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176659","title":"Iliad 23.218-23.221","body":"<p>analysis of the evidence of hero cult in the Iliad and the Odyssey (here, wine libation)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.218-23.221","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176723","title":"Iliad 23.230","body":"<p>reference in the context of analyzing names in -tōr, here regarding Stentōr</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.230","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176771","title":"Iliad 23.243-23.244","body":"<p>reference to the mixing of the ashes of Achilles and Patroklos in O.24.077 as not a duplication of references to the same mixing in the Iliad (here and 23.091-092), therefore not violating Munro’s law, in the context of analyzing a traditional suppression of anything overtly Iliadic in the Odyssey</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.243-23.244","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.176822","title":"Iliad 23.245-248...256-257/ anchor comment on: tomb of Achilles, part 2","body":"<p>See also anchor comment at I.23.125–126 on: tomb of Achilles, part 1, and anchor comment at O.24.076–084 on: tomb of Achilles, part 3.</p><p>The tomb of Patroklos, called <em>tumbos</em> here at I.I.23.245, will also become the tomb of Achilles when his time comes to die.

over there is a stump of deadwood, a good reach above ground level. |328 It had been either an oak or a pine. And it hasn’t rotted away from the rains. |329 There are two white rocks propped against either side of it. |330 There it is, standing at a point where two roadways meet, and it has a smooth track on both sides of it for driving a chariot. |331 It is either the tomb [<em>sēma</em>] of some mortal who died a long time ago |332 or was a turning point [<em>nussa</em>] in the times of earlier men. |333 Now swift-footed radiant Achilles has set it up as a turning point [<em>terma</em> plural]. |334 Get as close to it as you can when you drive your chariot horses toward it, |335 and keep leaning toward one side as you stand on the platform of your well-built chariot, |336 leaning to the left as you drive your horses. Your right-side horse |337 you must goad, calling out to it, and give that horse some slack as you hold its reins, |338 while you make your left-side horse get as close as possible [to the turning point], |339 so that the hub will seem to be almost grazing the post |340 - the hub of your well-made chariot wheel. But be careful not to touch the stone [of the turning point], |341 or else you will get your horses hurt badly and break your chariot in pieces. |342 That would make other people happy, but for you it would be a shame, |343 yes it would. So, near and dear [<em>philos</em>] as you are to me, you must be sound in your thinking and be careful. </p><p>(Epitomized from H24H 7§§3–6.) I concentrate here on the use of the word <em>sēma</em> in two verses, I.23.326 and I.23.331, concerning the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor to his son, the hero Antilokhos, about the <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ of an unnamed hero. I divide my analysis into four parts:</p><p>Part 1.</p><p>The two verses come from a passage where Nestor gives instructions to Antilokhos about the driving skills required for a charioteer to make a left turn around a landmark. As we will now learn from the context, this landmark is meant to be used as a turning point in the course of a chariot race that is being planned as the culminating athletic event of the Funeral Games for Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23. In the words of Nestor, this landmark is either a <em>sēma</em>, ‘tomb’, of an unnamed hero of the distant past, I.23.331, or it was once upon a time a ‘turning point’, a <em>nussa</em>, I.23.332, used for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. As I will argue, the master narrative of the <em>Iliad</em> shows that this <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ is to be understood as the tomb of Patroklos himself, which he will share with Achilles once Achilles too is dead. To understand this is to understand the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor.</p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The <em>sēma</em> that is the ‘tomb’ of the unnamed hero at I.23.331 is also a ‘sign’ of that hero’s cult, as signaled by the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ that is conveyed by the speaker at I.23.326. That is what I once argued in an essay entitled “<em>Sēma</em> and <em>Noēsis</em>: The Hero’s Tomb and the ‘Reading’ of Symbols in Homer and Hesiod” (<em>GM</em> 202-222). As I pointed out in that essay, we know from evidence external to Homeric poetry that the tomb of a cult hero could be used as the actual turning point of a chariot race: in the historical period, starting with the adoption of chariot racing in the athletic program of the Olympics (this adoption has been dated at around 680 BCE), the turning-point of chariot-races could be conceptualized as the tomb of a hero, whose restless spirit was capable of “spooking” the horses at the most dangerous moment of the chariot-race, the left turn around the turning point. (GMP 215-216, with reference to Pausanias 6.20.15-19).</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>According to the wording of Nestor, however, there seem at first to be two different interpretations of the landmark that he is showing to Antilokhos: what is being visualized is either a tomb of a cult hero from the distant past or it is a turning point for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. The landmark is an ambivalent sign. At least, it seems ambivalent, short range, on the basis of Nestor’s wording in this passage. Long range, however, on the basis of the overall plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, this wording will lead to a fusion of interpretations. And the sign that seemed at first to be ambivalent will become clear. Long range, the tomb of the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes the same landmark as the turning point of a chariot race from the distant past. That is because the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes a named hero from the immediate present of the <em>Iliad</em>. That hero is Patroklos, and he died just now, as it were, in <em>Iliad</em> 16. </p><p>Part 4</p><p>But Patroklos dies not only in the present time of the <em>Iliad</em>. He also did die a long time ago, from the standpoint of later generations who are listening to the story of the <em>Iliad</em>. So, the storytelling of the Iliad makes it possible for the athletic event of a chariot race from the distant past to become the same thing as the athletic event of a chariot race that is being held right now, in the same immediate present time of the story, in <em>Iliad</em> 23. And, as I argue, this race is intended to honor Patroklos as a once and future cult hero. See also the comment on O.11.119–137.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.326-23.343","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sēma ‘sign, signal; tomb’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.177887","title":"Iliad 23.326-23.333","body":"<p>analysis of the chariot race and turning point in terms of the twin myth, with the turning point/grave as the point of death and from whence the immortal twin initiates the return to life</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.326-23.333","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.177933","title":"Iliad 23.326","body":"<p>analysis of the phrase oude se lēsei/he lēthei in Nestor’s speech to Antilochus (and the entire chariot race sequence)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.326","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.177997","title":"Iliad 23.328","body":"<p>reference to exegetical problem discussed in Aristotle Sophistici Elenchi chapters 18, 19</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.328","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.178044","title":"Iliad 23.334-23.348","body":"<p>comparison of Nestor’s advice to Antilochus regarding the balance between inciting and restraining his horses and that of the Epeian twins</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.334-23.348","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.178089","title":"Iliad 23.335","body":"<p>reference to the fact Plato and Xenophon each report variant readings that are not found in the manuscript tradition (Labarbe 1949.415-416)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.335","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.178134","title":"Iliad 23.340-23.343","body":"<p>comparison of Nestor’s advice to Antilochus regarding the balance between inciting and restraining his horses and that of the Epeian twins, and the irony in Nestor’s advice (his own crash)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:23.340-23.343","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.178181","title":"Iliad 23.340","body":"<p>analysis of kúklos as a metaphor for the sum total of Homeric poetry and the craft of the carpenter to the art of the poet.
