He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>keeps him perforce; and he cannot return to his own land, for he has at hand no ships with oars and no comrades to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea.

Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"45\" unit=\"line\"/>immortal, golden, which were wont to bear him over the waters of the sea and over the boundless land swift as the blasts of the wind.

But when they had their fill of food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was the first to speak, and said:\n    “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land!

Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature, for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness.”\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>“Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for this.

Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus. She gave him a great axe, well fitted to his hands,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>an axe of bronze, sharpened on both sides; and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood, securely fastened; and thereafter she gave him a polished adze.

And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"395\" unit=\"line\"/>of a father who lies in sickness, bearing grievous pains, long while wasting away, and some cruel god assails him, but then to their joy the gods free him from his woe, so to Odysseus did the land and the wood seem welcome; and he swam on, eager to set foot on the land.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs—for the great wave thundered against the dry land, belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea; for there were neither harbors where ships might ride, nor road-steads,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>but projecting headlands, and reefs, and cliffs—then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"408"},{"n":"408","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"408\">\n    <p>\n    “Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>nowhere doth there appear a way to come forth from the grey sea. For without are sharp crags, and around them the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer, and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>Haply were I to seek to land, a great wave may seize me and dash me against the jagged rock, and so shall my striving be in vain. But if I swim on yet further in hope to find shelving beaches<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> and harbors of the sea, I fear me lest the storm-wind may catch me up again,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>and bear me, groaning heavily, over the teeming deep; or lest some god may even send forth upon me some great monster from out the sea—and many such does glorious Amphitrite breed. For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me.”\n    While he pondered thus in mind and heart,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>a great wave bore him against the rugged shore. There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put a thought in his mind. On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went by.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus then did he escape this wave, but in its backward flow it once more rushed upon him and smote him, and flung him far out in the sea. And just as, when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its suckers, even so from his strong hands<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>were bits of skin stripped off against the rocks; and the great wave covered him. Then verily would hapless Odysseus have perished beyond his fate, had not flashing-eyed Athena given him prudence. Making his way forth from the surge where it belched upon the shore, he swam outside, looking ever toward the land in hope to find<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>shelving beaches and harbors of the sea. But when, as he swam, he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in his heart:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>“Hear me, O king, whosoever thou art. As to one greatly longed-for<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> do I come to thee, seeking to escape from out the sea from the threats of Poseidon. Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees, after many toils.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay, pity me, O king, for I declare that I am thy suppliant.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"451"},{"n":"451","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"451\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of the river. And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall, for his spirit was crushed by the sea.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>And all his flesh was swollen, and sea water flowed in streams up through his mouth and nostrils. So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce strength to move; for terrible weariness had come upon him. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast, then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>and the great wave bore it back down the stream, and straightway Ino received it in her hands. But Odysseus, going back from the river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth, the giver of grain; and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>“Ah, woe is me! what is to befall me? What will happen to me at the last? If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit; and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>But if I climb up the slope to the shady wood and lie down to rest in the thick brushwood, in the hope that the cold and weariness might leave me, and if sweet sleep comes over me, I fear me lest I become a prey and spoil to wild beasts.”\n    Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him the better:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>he went his way to the wood and found it near the water in a clear space; and he crept beneath two bushes that grew from the same spot, one of thorn and one of olive. Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the rays of the bright sun beat,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>nor could the rain pierce through them, so closely did they grow, intertwining one with the other. Beneath these Odysseus crept and straightway gathered with his hands a broad bed, for fallen leaves were there in plenty, enough to shelter two men or three<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>in winter-time, however bitter the weather. And the much-enduring goodly Odysseus saw it, and was glad, and he lay down in the midst, and heaped over him the fallen leaves. And as a man hides a brand beneath the dark embers in an outlying farm, a man who has no neighbors,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>and so saves a seed of fire, that he may not have to kindle it from some other source, so Odysseus covered himself with leaves. And Athena shed sleep upon his eyes, that it might enfold his lids and speedily free him from toilsome weariness.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
