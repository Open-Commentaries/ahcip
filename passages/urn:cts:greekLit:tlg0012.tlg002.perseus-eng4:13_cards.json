I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall\n    know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your yellow\n    hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see it with\n    loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you, and make you an unseemly object\n    in the sight of the suitors, of your wife, and of the son whom you left behind\n    you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is in charge of your pigs; he has\n    been always well affected towards you, and is devoted to Penelope and your son;\n    you will find him feeding his pigs near the rock that is called Raven by the\n    fountain Arethusa, where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after\n    their manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going, while I proceed\n    to <placeName key=\"perseus,Sparta\">Sparta</placeName> and see your son, who is\n    with Menelaos at <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName>, where he\n    has gone to try and find a report [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] on\n    whether you are still alive.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"416\" unit=\"line\"/>\"But why,\" said Odysseus, \"did you not tell\n    him, for you knew all about it?

The suitors have put out to sea and\n    are lying in wait for him, for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I\n    do not much think they will succeed, but rather that some of those who are now\n    eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"429"},{"n":"429","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"429\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"429\" unit=\"line\"/>As she spoke Athena touched him with her wand\n    and covered him with wrinkles, took away all his yellow hair, and withered the\n    flesh over his whole body; she bleared his eyes, which were naturally very fine\n    ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him, and a\n    tunic, tattered, filthy, and begrimed with smoke; she also gave him an\n    undressed deer skin as an outer garment, and furnished him with a staff and a\n    wallet all in holes, with a twisted thong for him to sling it over his\n    shoulder.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"439\" unit=\"line\"/>When the pair had thus laid their plans they\n    parted, and the goddess went straight to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName> to fetch Telemakhos. <milestone n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
