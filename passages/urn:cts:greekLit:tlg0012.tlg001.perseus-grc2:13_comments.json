After Asios is killed, I.13.386–393, and his corpse is just lying there in front of the horses that once drew his chariot, I.13.392, the focus reverts to the <em><span class=\"chstranslitGreek\">hēni-okhos</span></em> ‘chariot driver’, I.13.394. Still standing on the chariot platform, the chariot driver freezes, failing to turn the chariot around and drive the horse team back to safety, I.13.394–396. The Achaean hero Antilokhos takes this opportunity to spear the chariot driver, who then falls out of the chariot, and now Antilokhos can mount the empty chariot and drive it away himself, horses and all, I.13.396–401.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.386","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"hēni-okhos ‘chariot driver’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"therapōn 'attendant, ritual substitute'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125490","title":"Iliad 13.402-423","body":"<p>Variants like <em>stenakhonta</em> and <em>stenakhonte</em> at I.13.423 can be seen as formulaic—in terms of the overall system of Homeric diction.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.402-13.423","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"formulaic variants"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125535","title":"Iliad 13.413-13.417","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of eukhesthai (formulas) in statements that the speaker has killed the warrior he stands over</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.413-13.417","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125581","title":"Iliad 13.413","body":"<p>in a list of examples of formulas for introducing a speech by an eukhomenos warrior, which Paris’ name-epithet formulas do not fit (in the context of analyzing I.11.379)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.413","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125644","title":"Iliad 13.417","body":"<p>in a list of secular eukhesthai indicating direct speech (concluding speech)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.417","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125690","title":"Iliad 13.434-13.437","body":"<p>analysis of the metaphor of binding for “killing” of an immortal etc., and here, thunderbolt binding a warrior</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.434-13.437","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125737","title":"Iliad 13.435","body":"<p>eyes as direct object of thelgein, in the context of analyzing thelgein and the Wooden Horse</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:13.435","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"thelgein 'put a trance on; enchant'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.125785","title":"Iliad 13.444","body":"<p>At the very moment when the hero dies here, the war-god Ares literally takes away the hero’s life or <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’.
