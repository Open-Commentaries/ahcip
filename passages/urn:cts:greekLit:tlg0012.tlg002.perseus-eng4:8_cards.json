She went up\n    to the citizens, man by man, and said, \"Aldermen and town councilors of the\n    Phaeacians, come to the assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has\n    just come off a long voyage to the house of King Alkinoos; he looks like an\n    immortal god.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words she made them all want to come,\n    and they flocked to the assembly till seats and standing room were alike\n    crowded. Every one was struck with the appearance of Odysseus, for Athena had\n    beautified [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharis</term>] him about the head and\n    shoulders, making him look taller and stouter than he really was, that he might\n    impress the Phaeacians favorably as being a very remarkable man, and might come\n    off well in the many trials [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>] of skill to\n    which they would challenge him.

They\n    moored the vessel a little way out from land, and then came on shore and went\n    to the house of King Alkinoos. The outhouses, yards, and all the precincts were\n    filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and Alkinoos\n    killed them a dozen sheep, eight full grown pigs, and two oxen.

Pontonoos set a seat for him among the guests,\n    leaning it up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over\n    his head, and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands.

When the bard left off singing he wiped the\n    tears from his eyes, uncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a\n    drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodokos to sing\n    further, for they delighted in his lays, then Odysseus again drew his mantle\n    over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alkinoos,\n    who was sitting near him, and heard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he\n    at once said, \"Aldermen and town councilors of the Phaeacians, we have had\n    enough now, both of the feast, and of the minstrelsy that is its due\n    accompaniment; let us proceed therefore to the athletic sports [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlos</term>], so that our guest on his return home may be\n    able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers,\n    wrestlers, jumpers, and runners.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"104\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he led the way, and the others\n    followed after.

Akroneos, Okyalos, Elatreus, Nauteus, Prymneus, Anchialos, Eretmeus,\n    Ponteus, Proreus, Thoon, Anabesineos, and Amphialos son of Polyneos son of\n    Tekton. There was also Euryalos son of Naubolos, who was like Ares himself, and\n    was the best looking man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas.

They then turned to the painful\n    art of wrestling, and here Euryalos proved to be the best man. Amphialos\n    excelled all the others in jumping, while at throwing the disc there was no one\n    who could approach Elatreus.

It will be worth a great deal to him.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"406\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of\n    Odysseus and said, \"Good luck to you, father stranger; if anything has been\n    said amiss may the winds blow it away with them, and may heaven grant you a\n    safe return, for I understand you have been long away from home, and have gone\n    through much hardship.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"412"},{"n":"412","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"412\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"412\" unit=\"line\"/>To which Odysseus answered, \"Good luck to you\n    too my friend, and may the gods grant you every happiness [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">olbos</term>]. I hope you will not miss the sword you have given me along\n    with your apology.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"416\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he girded the sword about his\n    shoulders and towards sundown the presents began to make their appearance, as\n    the servants of the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alkinoos;\n    here his sons received them, and placed them under their mother's charge. Then\n    Alkinoos led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"424\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Wife,\" said he, turning to Queen Arete, \"Go,\n    fetch the best chest we have, and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also, set\n    a copper on the fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see\n    also to the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made\n    him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that will\n    follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet - which is of exquisite\n    workmanship - that he may be reminded of me for the rest of his life whenever\n    he makes a drink-offering to Zeus, or to any of the gods.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"433\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod\n    upon the fire as fast as they could, whereon they set a tripod full of bath\n    water on to a clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze, and the water\n    became hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod. Meanwhile Arete\n    brought a magnificent chest her own room, and inside it she packed all the\n    beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the Phaeacians had brought. Lastly\n    she added a cloak and a good shirt from Alkinoos, and said to Odysseus:</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"443"},{"n":"443","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"443\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"443\" unit=\"line\"/>\"See to the lid yourself, and have the whole\n    bound round at once, for fear any one should rob you by the way when you are\n    asleep in your ship.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>When Odysseus heard this he put the lid on the\n    chest and made it fast with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so\n    before an upper servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was\n    very glad of a warm bath, for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he\n    left the house of Calypso, who as long as he remained with her had taken as\n    good care of him as though he had been a god. When the servants had done\n    washing and anointing him with oil, and had given him a clean cloak and shirt,\n    he left the bath room and joined the guests who were sitting over their wine.\n    Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the\n    room, and admired him as she saw him pass. \"Farewell stranger,\" said she, \"do\n    not forget me when you are safe at home again, for it is to me first that you\n    owe a ransom for having saved your life.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"463\" unit=\"line\"/>And Odysseus said, \"Nausicaa, daughter of great\n    Alkinoos, may Zeus the mighty husband of Hera, grant that I may reach my home\n    and see my day of <term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>; so shall I bless you as a\n    goddess all my days, for it was you who saved me.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"469\" unit=\"line\"/>When he had said this, he seated himself beside\n    Alkinoos. Supper was then served, and the wine was mixed for drinking. A\n    servant led in the favorite bard Demodokos, and set him in the midst of the\n    company, near one of the bearing-posts supporting the room, that he might lean\n    against it. Then Odysseus cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of fat (for\n    there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant, \"Take this piece\n    of pork over to Demodokos and tell him to eat it; for all the pain his lays may\n    cause me I will salute him none the less; bards get honor and respect [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>] throughout the world, for the Muse teaches them\n    their songs and loves them.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"482"},{"n":"482","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"482\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"482\" unit=\"line\"/>The servant carried the pork in his fingers\n    over to Demodokos, who took it and was very much pleased. They then laid their\n    hands on the good things that were before them, and as soon as they had had\n    enough to eat and drink, Odysseus said to Demodokos, \"Demodokos, there is no\n    one in the world whom I praise with admiration more than I do you. You must\n    have studied under the Muse, Zeus’ daughter, and under Apollo, - with such a\n    sense of order [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>] do you sing the return of\n    the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you were not there\n    yourself, you must have heard it all from some one who was. Now, however,\n    change your song and tell us of the construction [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>] of the wooden horse which Epeios made with the assistance of\n    Athena, and which Odysseus got by stratagem into the fort of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> after freighting it with the men who\n    afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will tell all\n    the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"499\" unit=\"line\"/>The bard, inspired by a god, lit up the picture\n    of his story, starting at the point where some of the Argives set fire to their\n    tents and sailed away while others, hidden within the horse, were waiting with\n    Odysseus in the Trojan place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn\n    the horse into their fortress, and it stood there while they sat in council\n    round it, and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for\n    breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top of the\n    rock on which the fortress stood, and then thrown down the precipice; while yet\n    others were for letting it remain as an offering and propitiation for the gods.\n    And this was how they settled it in the end, for the city was doomed when it\n    took in that horse, within which were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to\n    bring death and destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the\n    Achaeans issued from the horse, and sacked the town, breaking out from their\n    ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city here and there and ravaged it, and\n    how Odysseus went raging like Ares along with Menelaos to the house of\n    Deiphobos. It was there that the fight raged most furiously, nevertheless by\n    Athena's help he was victorious.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"521\" unit=\"line\"/>All this he told, but Odysseus was overcome as\n    he heard him, and his cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when\n    she throws herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own\n    city and people, fighting bravely in defense of his home and children. She\n    screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for breath and\n    dying, but her enemies beat her from behind about the back and shoulders, and\n    carry her off into slavery, to a life of labor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and sorrow, and the beauty fades from her cheeks - even so\n    piteously did Odysseus weep, but none of those present perceived his tears\n    except Alkinoos, who was sitting near him, and could hear the sobs and sighs\n    that he was heaving. The king, therefore, at once rose and said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"536\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Aldermen and town councilors of the\n    Phaeacians, let Demodokos cease his song, for there are those present who do\n    not seem to like it. From the moment that we had done supper and Demodokos\n    began to sing, our guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is\n    evidently in great distress [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>], so let the\n    bard leave off, that we may all enjoy ourselves, hosts and guest alike. This\n    will be much more as it should be, for all these festivities, with the escort\n    and the presents that we are making with so much good will, are wholly in his\n    honor, and any one with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he\n    ought to treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"548"},{"n":"548","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"548\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"548\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Therefore, sir, do you on your part affect no\n    more concealment nor reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will\n    be more polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your\n    father and mother over yonder used to call you, and by which you were known\n    among your neighbors and fellow-citizens.

Still I do remember hearing\n    my father say that Poseidon was angry with us for being too easy-going in the\n    matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he should wreck\n    a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted some one, and envelop\n    our city with a high mountain.
