There is he in his chamber and on his inlaid couch, gleaming with beauty and fair raiment.  Thou wouldest not deem that he had come thither from warring with a foe, but rather that he was going to the dance, or sat there as one that had but newly ceased from the dance.\n    </quote>\n    <milestone n=\"395\" unit=\"line\"/>So spake she, and stirred Helen's heart in her breast; and when she marked the beauteous neck of the goddess, her lovely bosom, and her flashing eyes, then amazement seized her, and she spake, and addressed her, saying:\n    <quote>Strange goddess, why art thou minded to beguile me thus?<milestone n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>Verily thou wilt lead me yet further on to one of the well-peopled cities of Phrygia or lovely Maeonia, if there too there be some one of mortal men who is dear to thee, seeing that now Menelaus hath conquered goodly Alexander, and is minded to lead hateful me to his home.<milestone n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>It is for this cause that thou art now come hither with guileful thought.  Go thou, and sit by his side, and depart from the way of the gods, neither let thy feet any more bear thee back to Olympus; but ever be thou troubled for him, and guard him, until he make thee his wife, or haply his slave.<milestone n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>But thither will I not go—it were a shameful thing—to array that man's couch; all the women of Troy will blame me hereafter; and I have measureless griefs at heart.\n    </quote>\n    Then stirred to wrath fair Aphrodite spake to her:\n    <quote>Provoke me not, rash woman, lest I wax wroth and desert thee,<milestone n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>and hate thee, even as now I love thee wondrously; and lest I devise grievous hatred between both, Trojans alike and Danaans; then wouldst thou perish of an evil fate.\n    </quote>\n    So spake she, and Helen, sprung from Zeus, was seized with fear; and she<note resp=\"Loeb\" anchored=\"true\">1</note> went, wrapping herself in her bright shining mantle,<milestone n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>in silence; and she was unseen of the Trojan women; and the goddess led the way.\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"421"},{"n":"421","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"421\">\n    <p>\n    Now when they were come to the beautiful palace of Alexander, the handmaids turned forthwith to their tasks, but she, the fair lady, went to the high-roofed chamber.  And the goddess, laughter-loving Aphrodite, took for her a chair,<milestone n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>and set it before the face of Alexander.  Thereon Helen sate her down, the daughter of Zeus that beareth the aegis, with eyes turned askance; and she chid her lord, and said:\n    <quote>Thou hast come back from the war; would thou hadst perished there, vanquished by a valiant man that was my former lord.<milestone n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>Verily it was thy boast aforetime that thou wast a better man than Menelaus, dear to Ares, in the might of thy hands and with thy spear.  But go now, challenge Menelaus, dear to Ares, again to do battle with thee, man to man.  But, nay, I of myself bid thee refrain, and not war amain against fair-haired Menelaus,<milestone n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>nor fight with him in thy folly, lest haply thou be vanquished anon by his spear.\n    </quote>\n    Then Paris made answer, and spake to her, saying:\n    <quote>Chide not my heart, lady, with hard words of reviling.  For this present hath Menelaus vanquished me with Athene's aid,<milestone n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>but another time shall I vanquish him; on our side too there be gods. But come, let us take our joy, couched together in love; for never yet hath desire so encompassed my soul—nay, not when at the first I snatched thee from lovely Lacedaemon and sailed with thee on my seafaring ships,<milestone n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>and on the isle of Cranae had dalliance with thee on the couch of love—as now I love thee, and sweet desire layeth hold of me.\n    </quote>\n    He spake, and led the way to the couch, and with him followed his wife.\n    Thus the twain were couched upon the corded bed; but the son of Atreus ranged through the throng like a wild beast,<milestone n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>if anywhere he might have sight of godlike Alexander.  But none of the Trojans or their famed allies could then discover Alexander to Menelaus, dear to Ares.  Not for love verily were they fain to hide him, could any have seen him, for he was hated of all even as black death.<milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the king of men, Agamemnon, spake among them, saying:\n    <quote>Hearken to me, ye Trojans and Dardanians and allies.  Victory is now of a surety seen to rest with Menelaus, dear to Ares; do ye therefore give up Argive Helen and the treasure with her, and pay ye in requital such recompense as beseemeth,<milestone n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>even such as shall abide in the minds of men that are yet to be.\n    </quote>\n    So spake the son of Atreus, and all the Achaeans shouted assent.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
