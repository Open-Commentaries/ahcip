She\n    took her stand by the huge black hull of Odysseus' ship which was middlemost of\n    all, so that her voice might carry farthest on either side, on the one hand\n    towards the tents of Ajax son of Telamon, and on the other towards those of\n    Achilles - for these two heroes, well-assured of their own strength, had\n    valorously drawn up their ships at the two ends of the line. There she took her\n    stand, and raised a cry both loud and shrill that filled the Achaeans with\n    courage, giving them heart to fight resolutely and with all their might, so\n    that they had rather stay there and do battle than go home in their ships. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>The son of Atreus shouted aloud and bade the\n    Argives gird themselves for battle while he put on his armor.

There had been a report [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] abroad, reaching as far as <placeName key=\"tgn,1000112\">Cyprus</placeName>, that the Achaeans were about to sail for <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"22\" unit=\"line\"/>and therefore he gave it to the king.

There were\n    serpents of lapis lazuli that reared themselves up towards the neck, three upon\n    either side, like the rainbows which the son of Kronos has set in heaven as a\n    sign to mortal men. About his shoulders he threw his sword, studded with bosses\n    of gold; and the scabbard was of silver with a chain of gold wherewith to hang\n    it. He took moreover the richly-equipped shield that covered his body when he\n    was in battle - fair to see, with ten circles of bronze running all round see,\n    wit it. On the body of the shield there were twenty bosses of white tin, with\n    another of dark lapis lazuli in the middle: this last was made to show a\n    Gorgon's head, fierce and grim, with Rout and Panic on either side. The band\n    for the arm to go through was of silver, on which there was a writhing snake of\n    lapis lazuli with three heads that sprang from a single neck, and went in and\n    out among one another. On his head Agamemnon set a helmet, with a peak before\n    and behind, and four plumes of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it; then\n    he grasped two redoubtable bronze-shod spears, and the gleam of his armor shot\n    from him as a flame into the firmament, while Hera and Athena thundered in\n    honor of the king of rich <placeName key=\"perseus,Mycenae\">Mycenae</placeName>. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"47\" unit=\"line\"/>Every man now left his horses in charge of his\n    charioteer to hold them in proper order [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>] by\n    the trench, while he went into battle on foot clad in full armor, and a mighty\n    uproar rose on high into the dawning.

Achilles had once taken both of them\n    prisoners in the glades of Ida, and had bound them with fresh withies as they\n    were shepherding, but he had taken a ransom for them; now, however, Agamemnon\n    son of Atreus smote Isos in the chest above the nipple with his spear, while he\n    struck Antiphos hard by the ear and threw him from his chariot. Forthwith he\n    stripped their goodly armor from off them and recognized them, for he had\n    already seen them at ships when Achilles brought them in from Ida. As a lion\n    fastens on the fawns of a hind and crushes them in his great jaws, robbing them\n    of their tender life while he on his way back to his lair - the hind can do\n    nothing for them even though she be close by, for she is in an agony of fear,\n    and flies through the thick forest, sweating, and at her utmost speed before\n    the mighty monster - so, no man of the Trojans could help Isos and Antiphos,\n    for they were themselves fleeing panic before the Argives. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"122\" unit=\"line\"/>Then King Agamemnon took the two sons of\n    Antimakhos, Peisandros and brave Hippolokhos.

The son of Atreus sprang upon them\n    like a lion, and the pair besought him from their chariot. \"Take us alive,\"\n    they cried, \"son of Atreus, and you shall receive a great ransom for us.

Foot\n    soldiers drove the foot soldiers of the foe in rout before them, and slew them;\n    horsemen did the like by horsemen, and the thundering tramp of the horses\n    raised a cloud of dust from off the plain.

First he sprang spear in\n    hand upon Deiopites and wounded him on the shoulder with a downward blow; then\n    he killed Thoon and Ennomos. After these he struck Chersidamas in the loins\n    under his shield as he had just sprung down from his chariot; so he fell in the\n    dust and clutched the earth in the hollow of his hand. These he let lie, and\n    went on to wound Charops son of Hippasus, brother to noble Sokos. Sokos, hero\n    that he was, made all speed to help him, and when he was close to Odysseus he\n    said, \"Far-famed Odysseus, insatiable of craft and toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>], this day you shall either boast of having killed both the\n    sons of Hippasus and stripped them of their armor, or you shall fall before my\n    spear.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"434\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he struck the shield of\n    Odysseus. The spear went through the shield and passed on through his richly\n    wrought cuirass, tearing the flesh from his side, but Pallas Athena did not\n    suffer it to pierce the entrails of the hero. Odysseus knew that his hour\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">telos</term>] was not yet come, but he gave ground and\n    said to Sokos, \"Wretch, you shall now surely die. You have stayed me from\n    fighting further with the Trojans, but you shall now fall by my spear, yielding\n    glory to myself, and your life-breath [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] to\n    Hades of the noble steeds.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>Sokos had turned in flight, but as he did so,\n    the spear struck him in the back midway between the shoulders, and went right\n    through his chest. He fell heavily to the ground and Odysseus vaunted over him\n    saying, \"O Sokos, son of Hippasus tamer of horses, the outcome [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">telos</term>] of death has been too quick for you and you\n    have not escaped him: poor wretch, not even in death shall your father and\n    mother close your eyes, but the ravening vultures shall enshroud you with the\n    flapping of their dark wings and devour you. Whereas even though I fall the\n    Achaeans will give me my due rites of burial.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"456\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying he drew Sokos' heavy spear out of his\n    flesh and from his shield, and the blood welled forth when the spear was\n    withdrawn so that he was much dismayed. When the Trojans saw that Odysseus was\n    bleeding they raised a great shout and came on in a body towards him; he\n    therefore gave ground, and called his comrades to come and help him. Thrice did\n    he cry as loudly as man can cry, and thrice did brave Menelaos hear him; he\n    turned, therefore, to Ajax who was close beside him and said, \"Ajax, noble son\n    of Telamon, leader of your people, the cry of Odysseus rings in my ears, as\n    though the Trojans had cut him off and were worsting him while he is\n    single-handed. Let us make our way through the throng; it will be well that we\n    defend him; I fear he may come to harm for all his valor if he be left without\n    support, and the Danaans would miss him sorely.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"472"},{"n":"472","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"472\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"472\" unit=\"line\"/>He led the way and mighty Ajax went with him.\n    The Trojans had gathered round Odysseus like ravenous mountain jackals round\n    the carcass of some horned stag that has been hit with an arrow - the stag has\n    fled at full speed so long as his blood was warm and his strength has lasted,\n    but when the arrow has overcome him, the savage jackals devour him in the shady\n    glades of the forest.

Hektor tore his\n    way through and flung himself into the thick of the fight, and his presence\n    threw the Danaans into confusion, for his spear was not long idle; nevertheless\n    though he went among the ranks with sword and spear, and throwing great stones,\n    he avoided Ajax son of Telamon, for Zeus would have been angry with him if he\n    had fought a better man than himself. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"544\" unit=\"line\"/>Then father Zeus from his high throne struck\n    fear into the heart of Ajax, so that he stood there dazed and threw his shield\n    behind him- looking fearfully at the throng of his foes as though he were some\n    wild beast, and turning hither and thither but crouching slowly backwards.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"548\" unit=\"line\"/>As peasants with their hounds chase a lion from\n    their stockyard, and watch by night to prevent his carrying off the pick of\n    their herd - he makes his greedy spring, but in vain, for the darts from many a\n    strong hand fall thick around him, with burning brands that scare him for all\n    his fury, and when morning comes he slinks foiled and angry away - even so did\n    Ajax, sorely against his will, retreat angrily before the Trojans, fearing for\n    the ships of the Achaeans.

Any one else\n    would hardly have been able to lift it from the table when it was full, but\n    Nestor could do so quite easily. In this the woman, as fair as a goddess, mixed\n    them a mess with Pramnian wine; she grated goat's milk cheese into it with a\n    bronze grater, threw in a handful of white barley-meal, and having thus\n    prepared the mess she bade them drink it.
