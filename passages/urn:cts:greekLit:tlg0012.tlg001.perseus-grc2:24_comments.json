The Master Narrator states here that this tomb belongs to Patroklos, as if the ultimate ownership of the tomb by Achilles were still in doubt. But the statement is justified, since the size of the tomb has not yet been adjusted to fit the prestige of Achilles himself: on this point see the anchor comment at I.23.245–248 and 256–257. Achilles drives his chariot around the tomb three times, then rests in his <em>klisiē</em> ‘shelter’, I.24.017, and then drives around three times again, and so on. Each time he rests inside his shelter, he leaves the body outside, lying prone in the dust, face down, I.24.017–018. The body has been shown before in this same degraded state: see the comment on I.22.395–405. Once again here, it is left to the imagination whether the body is horribly disfigured. It cannot be known, however, whether the body that Achilles is intending to degrade has in fact already been disfigured. Once again, the face is not visible. But, once again, it will become clear that the face and the head and in fact the whole body of Hector cannot be disfigured.

Apollo focuses here on Hector’s <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’, I.24.019, worrying that the hero’s skin will be grotesquely scraped away by the harsh surface over which it is being dragged behind the speeding chariot of Achilles, I.24.021. This time, the protective covering that is granted by the gods is not an enveloping glow, as it was at I.23.188–191 (see the anchor comment at I.23.184–191), but rather a mystical <em>aigis</em> ‘skin-shield’, I.24.020.

And the story is told in terms of a contrast between positive and negative words. The fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽).

At Ι.24.050–052, the god condemns especially the violence of Achilles, and he points to the hero’s dragging the corpse of Hector, I.24.050–052, around the <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ of Patroklos, I.24.051. In this context of condemning the hero’s violence, the god compares him to a ravenous lion at I.24.041–043. The wild beast is driven by its wild instincts, described here as its <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’ and its <em>thūmos</em> ‘heart’, I.24.042, as it lunges to devour the sheep that it is attacking, and here the word <em>dais</em> ‘portion (of meat)’ is used in referring to the meat of its prey, I.24.43. There is an irony here in the use of the word <em>dais</em>, since this word is closely connected to stories about Achilles: see the comments on I.07.319–322, I.19.044, I.19.179–180. The picturing of a ravenous lion that is lunging for the meat of its prey is comparable to the use of the word <em>sōma</em> at I.03.023 and I.18.161: what is pictured in both these contexts is a carcass that is being devoured by a ravenous lion that holds on to it and won’t let go. Here is what I said about such contexts in Point 6 of the anchor comment for I.23.184–191: for wild animals, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved for devouring, while for humans the sōma is something that must be saved from being devoured by wild animals. See also the comment on I.22.346–348, where I analyze other comparisons of Achilles to lions.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.32-24.54","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sēma ‘tomb’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"thūmos ‘heart’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dais ‘portion (of meat); sacrifice’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sōma ‘body’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.183595","title":"Iliad 24.39-24.48","body":"<p>analysis of Apollo’s words on Achilles as echoing earlier lines concerning persons whose actions incur mēnis</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.39-24.48","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.183640","title":"Iliad 24.43","body":"<p>evidence for Zenodotus’ alternate reading οἰωνοῖσι τε δαῖτα (Athenaeus Epitome 12f) at Il.

The first main part is at I.24.720–722, where professional <em>aoidoi</em> ‘singers’ who are men, I.24.720, perform <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721; as they perform, the word that refers to their performance is <em>thrēneîn</em> ‘make lament’, I.24.722, which is a verb derived from the noun <em>thrēnos</em> ‘lament’. Following up on the laments performed by the professional singers are laments performed by the <em>gunaikes</em> ‘women’ of Troy, I.24.722. These women, as women singers, are of course non-professionals, and their role as singers is subordinated to the role of the professional singers, as we see from the use of the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’ at I.24.722 in referring to their performance. This act of wailing-in-response is treated here as an antiphonal complement to the singing of the professional singers, who are described as <em>ex-arkhoi</em> ‘lead singers’ of the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’ that they sing, I.24.721. By now we have reached the end of the narrative about the first main part of the laments performed at the funeral of Hector. Now the narrative about the second part of the laments can begin, and this part, as noted already, can be subdivided into three sub-parts. The Master Narrator now quotes, as it were, three laments, to be performed by Andromache at I.24.725–745, by Hecuba at I.24.748–759, and by Helen at I.24.762–775. But the two main parts in this overall scheme are not kept separate here, since the same women who sang at I.24.722 their responses to the laments sung by men who were lead singers will now perform responses to the three women who will now be singing their own laments, and these three will now be singing as lead singers in their own right, as expressed by the verb <em>arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ in the case of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 / I.24.761. These three singing women are not professionals, but nevertheless they hold positions of great social status, since they all belong to Hector’s immediate family: as family members, they sing a form of lament that qualifies as a <em>góos</em>, not as a <em>thrēnos</em>. This word <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ is applied to the singing of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 (also at I.24.760) / I. 24.761. Of these three, the most important performer of lament here is Andromache, since she gets to cradle the head of Hector from behind while she sings her song of lament over his corpse, I.24.724. The special importance of Andromache is also signaled by the fact that the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’, which had signaled at I.24.722 the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721, that were sung by the professional lead singers, is also used at I.24.746 to signal the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, I.24.723, that is sung by Andromache as the non-professional lead singer. The general response at I.24.746 by the women of Troy to the lament of Andromache is an intensification of the more specific response at I.22.515 by the women who attended her when she previously sang her second lament, though the wording is exactly the same at I.24.746 as at I.22.515: ‘So she [= Andromache] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). An even more general response, however, occurs at I.24.776, where not just the women of Troy but the entire <em>dēmos</em> or ‘populace’ of the city joins the antiphonal singing, as signaled here by the verb <em>epi-stenein</em> ‘wail in response’: ‘So she [= Helen] spoke, and the vast populace [<em>dēmos</em>] wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δ’ ἔστενε δῆμος ἀπείρων). Now the whole community is lamenting in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ as re-started at I.24.761 by Helen as the last of the three women who sing here as lead singers.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.720-24.776","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"thrēnos ‘lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"thrēneîn ‘make lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ex-arkhos ‘lead singer’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ex-arkhein ‘lead off [in performing]'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"góos ‘lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"goân ‘make lament’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"epi-stenakhesthai ‘wail in response"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"epi-stenein ‘wail in response’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dēmos ‘community; district; populace'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188222","title":"Iliad 24.723–746/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 3","body":"<p>In the first of the three laments performed by Andromache, as quoted by the Master Narrator at I.06.407–439, she is already lamenting the death of Hector before he is even dead.

Here I find it relevant to cite the archaeological background on the practice of cremation in the Mycenaean era. I quote a brief summary in Nagy 2015.07.22 §31:</p><p>When I last considered the practices of cremation in a Mycenaean context [in 1990: GMP 85–86], those practices were barely attested archaeologically. But now, with the discovery of nine cremations at the site of Chánia, some three kilometers southwest of the acropolis of Mycenae [Palaiologou 2013], the picture has changed. I note with special interest the splendor of the tumulus that contained these cremations, dated to the 12th century BCE [Palaiologou 2013.274]. The archeologist of record describes as “monumental” the stone tumulus with its circular “cyclopean” enclosure, and she notes that the ritual moment of the actual cremation, which required vast pilings of firewood, must have been “spectacular” [Palaiologou 2013.251]. This splendid tumulus, situated on a plain contiguous with Argos, was most visible to all: “it served as a landmark for the control of the commercial route to Argos and the cultivated area simultaneously” [Palaiologou 2013:275]. By this time, in the 12th century BCE, the glory days of Mycenae and of its Achaean realm were becoming evanescent, but the vitality of Mycenaean culture was still a forceful presence, acknowledged and respected by the local population.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.785-24.804","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"cremation of Hector"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188638","title":"Epilogue 1: Hector as the ultimate beau mort","body":"<p>See also anchor comment at I.23.184–194.</p><p>[epitome from HC 4§267]</p><p>The focus of the <em>Iliad</em> on Hector as the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> is evident at the conclusion of this epic. The <em>Iliad</em> as we know it ends with the funeral of Hector, not of Achilles. It is Hector, not Achilles, who is lamented at the end. Even the very last word of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it is a signature for Hector: it is his ornamental epithet <em>hippodamos</em>, the ‘horse-tamer’, I.24.804 (Sacks 1987). So, the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> evolved in such a way as to highlight Hector as the primary point of interest in the poetics of terror and pity. To be contrasted is an alternative epic like the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, where the focus at the end is evidently on Achilles as the primary <em>beau mort</em>. Pindar’s reference to the dead Achilles in <em>Isthmian</em> 8 (56-60) alludes to this alternative epic tradition (PH 204–206). In the <em>Iliad</em>, the doomed figure of Hector has been substituted for the equally doomed figure of Achilles, who is the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> of epic. Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> prefigures Achilles as that ultimate <em>beau mort</em>. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.804","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"beau mort (a dead body made beautiful by way of a beautiful death; une belle mort)"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188691","title":"Epilogue 2: Hector as an ideal for Athenians","body":"<p>[epitome from HC 4§268]</p><p>This foregrounding of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> as we know it is a matter of politics as well as esthetics. The beautiful death of Hector, his <em>belle mort</em>, is for Athenians an expression of their empire. See the comment on I.15.494–499, where I made an epitome from HC 4§268. In what follows, I repeat the relevant parts of that epitome. The Athenian statesman Lycurgus says it best when he refers to the willingness of Athenian citizens to die in war not only for their own <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ but also for all of Hellas as a <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 104). Lycurgus invokes as his prime example the <em>belle mort</em> of the Athenian citizen-warriors who fought at Marathon and who thereby won for Hellas a freedom from terror, an <em>adeia</em> ‘security’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (104). The Athenian statesman is making this reference to the imperial interests of Athens in the context of actually quoting the words of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em>, who says that he is willing to die for his fatherland in order to protect it against the Achaeans (Lycurgus <em>Against</em> <em>Leokrates</em> 103 lines 4-9). These heroic words of Hector correspond to I.15.494–499, and Lycurgus quotes them in the larger Athenian festival of the context of saying that the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, as performed at the quadrennial Athenian festival of the Panathenaia, are the ancestral heritage of the Athenians and the primary source of their education as citizen-warriors (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 102). In this invocation of Homeric poetry as the most sublime expression of the Athenian empire, the statesman is quoting the words of a Trojan, not the words of an Achaean. It is the <em>belle</em> <em>mort</em> of Hector that motivates the Athenians to live up to the heroic legacy they learn from Homer. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.804","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188756","title":"Iliad 24.735b","body":"<p>contrasting of the narrative in the Iliad with Aeolian, Ionian and Dorian versions, here regarding the death/survival of Astyanax/Scamandrius</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188805","title":"Iliad 24.613a1","body":"<p>analysis of petrified characters, here in Niobe’s story, and Aristarchus’ analysis of 611 in the passage as Homeric but 614-617 as non-Homeric [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:24.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]}]
