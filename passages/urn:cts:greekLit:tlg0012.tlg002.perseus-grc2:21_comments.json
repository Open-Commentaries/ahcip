This contest will determine, once and for all, who is really eligible, among all the Achaeans, to be recognized as the husband of the queen. But the winning of this ultimate contest by Odysseus is not enough: the king must now kill, with the same bow, all the would-be husbands of the queen. So, once Odysseus passes the test set by Penelope, as narrated toward the end of Rhapsody 21, the killing of the rival Achaeans can begin in Rhapsody 22. And the overall occasion for both the passing of Penelope’s test and the killing of the suitors is the beginning of a grand festival celebrating the god Apollo and the arrival of spring. </p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Thebes_Heracles_bow_74000209.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Hēraklēs stringing a bow.

The bow is a gift of friendship from Iphitus, whom Odysseus meets while in Messene to collect a debt owed by the Messenians: they had taken three hundred sheep and their shepherds from Ithaca. Iphitus likewise is in search of twelve lost mares. The situation framing their encounter sets out a model for how reciprocation should work, even if “negative” as here, starting in theft: Odysseus is due recompense for the three hundred sheep and their shepherds. The theft of the sheep and shepherds parallels the suitors’ slaughtering of and feasting on Odysseus’ livestock and abuse of his household. </p><p></p><p>The suitable recompense for the suitors’ arrogance is foreshadowed in the story of the bow, as well. The twelve mares that Iphitus has come to reclaim turn out to be his undoing when Herakles kills him to keep the mares. Herakles does this while a guest in Iphitus’ house, without regard for the fact that he is offered food there – and without regard for the <em>opis </em>of the gods (<em>Od</em>. 21.28: <em>σχέτλιος, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν αἰδέσατ’</em>, “merciless one, and he did not fear the <em>opis</em> of gods”). Watkins (1977) has shown that <em>opis</em> is synonymous with <em>mēnis</em>. In comparing this line with a nearly identical one in Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days</em> (<em>σχέτλιοι, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν εἰδότες</em>, “merciless ones, and they did not know the <em>opis</em> of gods,” 187) where the transgressions incurring the <em>opis</em> are also listed<em>, </em>it is evident that divine retribution for transgression against the rules that maintain the cosmic order is meant. The scene between Herakles and Iphitus is one of hospitality (<em>Od</em>. 21.28-29), which parallels the situation between the suitors and Odysseus in the main narrative. Just as Herakles in the inset narrative breaks the rules of hospitality, so in the framing narrative do the suitors. Where the inset narrative contrasts with the main narrative is in the punishment: unlike Herakles, the suitors do not get out scot-free. The instrument of their undoing is the bow, the weapon that gives rise to this inset narrative. It is a gift of friendship (<em>Od</em>. 21.35), and as Seaford (1994) notes, it embodies the relationship of guest-friendship and the rules of hospitality; as such, it is an appropriate punisher for the abuse of hospitality. I would like to add that we are even told that Odysseus does not take this bow with him when he goes to Troy, but leaves it at home as a <em>μνῆμα ξείνοιο φίλοιο</em>, “a reminder of a dear guest-friend” (<em>Odyssey</em> 21.40). Appropriately, in a further way, then, the instrument of the suitors’ punishment embodies also the memory that leads to good conduct as a marker and upholder of a relationship of exchanging <em>kharites</em>, the reciprocal exchange of good turns. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p>See further: </p><p></p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

Next, Odysseus tests the tautness of his bowstring, plucking it, and the sound that emanates from the string is said to be like a song: the string literally ‘sings’, as expressed by the verb <em>hup–aeidein</em> ‘sing [<em>aedein</em>] while accompanying [<em>hupo</em>-]’, O.21.411.

See the anchor comment on those lines. After having successfully accomplished the two feats of stringing the bow and shooting through the holes of the twelve axe-heads, Odysseus can truly say to Telemachus: now is the <em>hōrā</em> ‘season’, O.21.428 (νῦν δ’ ὥρη). As the wording of Odysseus goes on to explain at O.21.429–430, now is the season for ‘the Achaeans’ to be feasting, in daylight, and there will be eating and drinking, also singing and dancing, as expressed by the noun <em>molpē</em> ‘singing-and-dancing’, O.21.430. On <em>molpē</em> as a combination of singing and dancing, see the note at O.04.015–019. Such merriment, as the wording highlights in the same line, O.21.430, is what happens on the occasion of a <em>dais</em> ‘feast. The word is used here in the general sense of ‘feast’, with reference to a <em>stylized festival</em>. On the use of this word <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ elsewhere as well in this general sense, see especially the comments at O.08.429 and at O.13.023; also the comment at O.20.276–289 with specific reference to the festival of Apollo. The overall wording of Odysseus here at O.21.429–430 can be read as good news about good feasting ahead for those in the post-epic future who will be participating in the festival of Apollo—but it is bad news for the suitors, whose perverted feasting in the epic present will soon lead to the carnage that commences in Rhapsody 22. This killing of the suitors, which follows the stringing of the bow and the winning of the ultimate contest in archery, is the third part of an epic mythological complex that functions as an aetiology for the post-epic ritual complex of celebrating the festival of Apollo by happily eating and drinking, singing and dancing. As Odysseus says at O.21.428, the season has arrived for such celebration. It is the season of springtime, and the song of swallows has once again returned to the land, as we saw previously at O.21.411. See again the comment at O.21.404–411. The mythological violence in the epic present will lead to ritual order in the post-epic future as celebrated at the festival of Apollo. For more on the ritualized function of this festival as stylized in the narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>, I recommend the comprehensive analysis of Levaniouk 2011, especially pp. 13–15.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:21.429-21.430","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"dais 'feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"festival of Apollo"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aetiology"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"molpē ‘singing-and-dancing’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"stylized festival"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hōrā ‘season’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.246386","title":"Odyssey 21.429","body":"<p>In the context of a future celebration, taking place in a post-heroic age at the festival of Apollo, the term <em>hepsiâsthai</em> ‘mock’ could refer to the ridiculing of the suitors by way of blame poetry. Odysseus as speaker here may be speaking beyond his own epic time, beyond the heroic age, by mocking his rivals for not yet knowing what he already knows full well will happen to them. On the perspectives of a post-heroic age with regard to the festival of Apollo, see the comment at O.22.437–479, where it is argued that the various grim dysfunctionalities that pollute the heroic world in <em>myth</em> are expurgated in the post-heroic world by way of <em>ritual</em>, as in the case of seasonally recurring festivals where primal ordeals are re-enacted in contexts of festive celebration, even merriment.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:21.429","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"hepsiâsthai ‘mock’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"festival of Apollo"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"blame poetry"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.246433","title":"Odyssey 21.537","body":"<p>evidence for the description of D.B.
