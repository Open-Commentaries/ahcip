And when they reached the glorious palace of the king, they sat down in rows on the chairs and high seats;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"390\" unit=\"line\"/>and on their coming the old man mixed for them a bowl of sweet wine, which now in the eleventh year the housewife opened, when she had loosed the string that held the lid. Thereof the old man bade mix a bowl, and earnestly he prayed, as he poured libations, to Athena, the daughter of Zeus who bears the aegis.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"395\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, they went, each to his home, to take their rest. But the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key=\"perseus,Gerenia\">Gerenia</placeName>, bade Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, to sleep there on a corded bedstead under the echoing portico,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>and by him Peisistratus, of the good ashen spear, a leader of men, who among his sons was still unwed in the palace. But he himself slept in the inmost chamber of the lofty house, and beside him lay the lady his wife, who had strewn the couch.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"404"},{"n":"404","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"404\">\n    <p>\n    Soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>up from his bed rose the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key=\"perseus,Gerenia\">Gerenia</placeName>, and went forth and sat down on the polished stones which were before his lofty doors, white and glistening as with oil.<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> On these of old was wont to sit Neleus, the peer of the gods in counsel;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>but he ere this had been stricken by fate and had gone to the house of Hades, and now there sat upon them in his turn Nestor of <placeName key=\"perseus,Gerenia\">Gerenia</placeName>, the warder of the Achaeans, holding a sceptre in his hands. About him his sons gathered in a throng as they came forth from their chambers, Echephron and Stratius and Perseus and Aretus and godlike Thrasymedes;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>and to these thereafter came as the sixth the lord Peisistratus. And they led godlike Telemachus and made him sit beside them; and the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key=\"perseus,Gerenia\">Gerenia</placeName>, was first to speak among them:\n    “Quickly, my dear children, fulfil my desire, that first of all the gods I may propitiate Athena,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>who came to me in manifest presence to the rich feast of the god. Come now, let one go to the plain for a heifer, that she may come speedily, and that the neatherd may drive her; and let one go to the black ship of great-hearted Telemachus and bring all his comrades, and let him leave two men only;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>and let one again bid the goldsmith Laerces come hither, that he may overlay the heifer's horns with gold. And do ye others abide here together; and bid the handmaids within to make ready a feast throughout our glorious halls, to fetch seats, and logs to set on either side of the altar, and to bring clear water.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>So he spoke, and they all set busily to work. The heifer came from the plain and from the swift, shapely ship came the comrades of great-hearted Telemachus; the smith came, bearing in his hands his tools of bronze, the implements of his craft, anvil and hammer and well-made tongs,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>wherewith he wrought the gold; and Athena came to accept the sacrifice. Then the old man, Nestor, the driver of chariots, gave gold, and the smith prepared it, and overlaid therewith the horns of the heifer, that the goddess might rejoice when she beheld the offering. And Stratius and goodly Echephron led the heifer by the horns,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>and Aretus came from the chamber, bringing them water for the hands in a basin embossed with flowers, and in the other hand he held barley grains in a basket; and Thrasymedes, steadfast in fight, stood by, holding in his hands a sharp axe, to fell the heifer; and Perseus held the bowl for the blood. Then the old man, Nestor, driver of chariots,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>began the opening rite of hand-washing and sprinkling with barley grains, and earnestly he prayed to Athena, cutting off as first offering the hair from the head, and casting it into the fire.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"447"},{"n":"447","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"447\">\n    <p>\n    Now when they had prayed, and had strewn the barley grains, straightway the son of Nestor, Thrasymedes, high of heart, came near and dealt the blow; and the axe cut through the sinews<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>of the neck, and loosened the strength of the heifer. Then the women raised the sacred cry, the daughters and the sons' wives and the revered wife of Nestor, Eurydice, the eldest of the daughters of Clymenus, and the men raised the heifer's head from the broad-wayed earth and held it, and Peisistratus, leader of men, cut the throat.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>And when the black blood had flowed from her and the life had left the bones, at once they cut up the body and straightway cut out the thigh-pieces all in due order, and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh upon them. Then the old man burned them on billets of wood, and poured over them sparkling wine,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the inner parts, they cut up the rest and spitted and roasted it, holding the pointed spits in their hands.\n    Meanwhile the fair Polycaste,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>the youngest daughter of Nestor, son of Neleus, bathed Telemachus. And when she had bathed him and anointed him richly<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> with oil, and had cast about him a fair cloak and a tunic, forth from the bath he came in form like unto the immortals; and he went and sat down by Nestor, the shepherd of the people.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when they had roasted the outer flesh and had drawn it off the spits, they sat down and feasted, and worthy men waited on them, pouring wine<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">2</note> into golden cups. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, the horseman, Nestor of <placeName key=\"perseus,Gerenia\">Gerenia</placeName>, was first to speak, saying:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>“My sons, up, yoke for Telemachus horses with beautiful mane beneath the car, that he may get forward on his journey.”\n    So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed; and quickly they yoked beneath the car the swift horses. And the housewife placed in the car bread and wine<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>and dainties, such as kings, fostered of Zeus, are wont to eat. Then Telemachus mounted the beautiful car, and Peisistratus, son of Nestor, a leader of men, mounted beside him, and took the reins in his hands. He touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped on<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>to the plain, and left the steep citadel of <placeName key=\"perseus,Pylos\">Pylos</placeName>. So all day long they shook the yoke which they bore about their necks.\n    Now the sun set and all the ways grew dark. And they came to Pherae, to the house of Diocles, son of Ortilochus, whom Alpheus begot.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/> There they spent the night, and before them he set the entertainment due to strangers.\n    So soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they yoked the horses and mounted the inlaid car, and drove forth from the gateway and the echoing portico. Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>So they came to the wheat-bearing plain, and thereafter pressed on toward their journey's end, so well did their swift horses bear them on. And the sun set and all the ways grew dark.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
