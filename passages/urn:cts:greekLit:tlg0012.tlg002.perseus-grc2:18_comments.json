[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.011296","title":"Anchor comment on extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative","body":"<p>Here is what Antinoos threatens to do to Iros if this beggar loses the fight with the disguised Odysseus, O.18.085–087: Iros will be put on a ship and sent off from the island of Ithaca over to the mainland, and there the hapless beggar will be handed over to a mysteriously infernal figure named Ekhetos, who will proceed to cut off his prisoner’s nose and ears and then ‘pull out’ his genitals, feeding them to the dogs. I have a special reason for choosing to focus on these horrific torments in presenting my anchor comment on extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative. Here is the reason: these same horrific torments, which are imagined here at O.18.085–087 as happening only in the future, become realities later on, at O.22.474–479. But who will inflict the same torments in this later passage? Will it be the infernal Ekhetos? No, in this case, the agents of torment will be Philoitios the cowherd and Eumaios the swineherd, perhaps with the help of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus. True, the person who is punished at O.22.475–477, the goathered Melanthios, is presented as a morally negative character, no better than the beggar Iros. But the persons who inflict the torments in this passage are understood to be morally positive. See the comment at O.22.437–479. So, an explanation is still needed for understanding how these supposedly righteous men could ever bring themselves to the point of inflicting horrors that were parallel to the horrors potentially inflicted by the mysteriously infernal Ekhetos. Part of an explanation can be found in another passage, O.21.308–309, where Antinoos commands the disguised Odysseus not even to make an attempt at stringing the bow: if you persist, Antinoos threatens, you will be sent off to that infernal character Ekhetos. Although the words of Antinoos leave unmentioned here at O.21.308–309 any threatened loss of nose and ears and genitals, his earlier words at O.21.300–301 have already compared Odysseus to a Centaur named Eurytion, whose ears and nose were indeed chopped off by his outraged hosts after he misbehaved at their feast. For more on the story of Eurytion the Centaur, see the comment at O.21.288–310.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:18.85-18.87","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ekhetos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Melanthios"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Iros"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Eurytion the Centaur"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.011423","title":"Odyssey 18.115-116","body":"<p>The suitors as a group reinforce the threat to send Iros to the mysteriously infernal Ekhetos.

We see here the story of a mock epic character who looks like an epic hero on the outside but who does not measure up, on the inside, to epic standards. In outward appearance, he qualifies as <em>megas</em> ‘great, big’, O.18.04, but he is ridiculously weak on the inside: that is, he lacks the epic inner quality of <em>īs</em> ‘force, violence, strength’, O.18.03. This quality, so blatantly lacking in the character of Iros, is also indicated by way of the word <em>biē</em> at O.18.04, which means the same thing as does <em>īs</em> at O.18.03: ‘force, violence, strength’.

He stood out, with his gluttonous [<em>margē</em>] stomach, |3 because of his endless eating and drinking. And he had no <em>īs</em>, |4 nor <em>biē</em>, but in appearance he was big to look at.</p><p>Here I leave untranslated the synonyms <em>īs</em> and <em>biē</em>, both of which I had previously translated as ‘force, strength, violence’ in the note at O.18.001–117. As I already observed in that note, appearances here are deceiving: Iros looks strong on the outside but he is weak on the inside, and the exposure of his weakness will prove to be something that is ridiculed in epic. The act of ridiculing is the program, as it were, of mock epic, but here the mocking is reversed: now it is epic that will be mocking mock epic. As we are about to see, epic will overcome mock epic. Odysseus, even though he looks weak on the outside, will beat up on Iros, who looks strong on the outside. The mock epic form to which the epic refers here is signaled by a most telling word: it is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’, at O.18.002, describing the <em>gastēr</em> ‘stomach’ of Iros, who stands out as an ostentatiously greedy consumer of food and drink, O.18.002–003. A character who is <em>margos</em> is not just a negative example of lowly humans in general: in the poetic language of praise/blame, such a character is a negative example of lowly poets in particular. A lowly man who is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’ is to be seen generically as a greedy blame poet. Such a blame poet, as we will now see, is typical of a poetic form that I describe here as mock epic. We can see the formal features of such a poetic form at the very beginning of Rhapsody 18, where the wording matches in syntax the beginning of a mock epic known as the <em>Margites</em>. There the main character to be introduced on stage, as it were, is described not as a <em>ptōkhos</em> ‘beggar’, as here at O.18.001, but as a poet who turns out to be a blame poet. I show here the actual wording that we find at the beginning of that mock epic (<em>Margites</em> F 1 ed. West):</p><p>|1 ἦλθέ τις ἐς Κολοφῶνα γέρων καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδός, |2 Μουσάων θεράπων καὶ ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος, |3 φίλῃς ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν εὔφθογγον λύρην</p><p>|1 Then came to Colophon some man, an old man, a divine [<em>theios</em>] singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |2 surrogate [<em>therapōn</em>] of the Muses and of Apollo who shoots from afar, |3 and in his hands, those hands of his, he held a lyre that made a beautiful sound.</p><p>As we see from the explicit description here, Margites is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’: that is, he is a poet. Moreover, he is a blame poet, as we see even from the morphology of his name <em>Margī́tēs</em>, derived from the adjective <em>margós</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’. This “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Margī́tēs</em> is morphologically parallel to another &quot;speaking name,&quot; <em>Thersī́tēs</em>, which means &#x27;the bold one&#x27; (tharsos/thersos is &#x27;boldness&#x27; in negative contexts of blame poetry). This character named Thersites is represented in the <em>Iliad</em> as a blame poet of the worst kind: see the comments at I.02.214, I.02.216, I.02.217–219, I.02.221, I.02.222, I.02.224, I.02.225–242, I.02.235, I.02.241–242, I.02.243, I.02.245, I.02.246–264, I.02.246, I.02.247, I.02.248–249, I.02.251, I.02.255, I.02.256, I.02.265–268, I.02.269–270, I.02.275, I.02.277. In the narrative about Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, as I pointed out in my comments on the verses I just listed, it is clear that blame poetry is antithetical not only to praise poetry but also to epic, and that epic has the power to blame, in its own right, this blame poetry. Thus, epic can defeat blame poetry, making it an object of ridicule just as blame poets attempt to make epic an object of ridicule. When Odysseus beats up on Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry. Similarly, when Odysseus beats up on Iros in the <em>Odyssey</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry and, further, epic is also defeating mock epic. In the case of the <em>Margites</em>, this mock epic starts off mock seriously by describing the poet simply as a poet, though the he will turn out to be a blame poet as the narrative proceeds. The metrical form of such mock epic is a combination of two kinds of verses: (1) dactylic hexameters, which are the medium of epic, and (2) iambic trimeters, which had once been the medium of mock poetry in general—the word for which is <em>iambos</em> (BA 243–252). A case in point is what we find in the attested fragments of the <em>Margites</em>: in the three verses of this poem’s beginning, already quoted above, the first two verses are dactylic hexameters, to be contrasted with the third verse, which is an iambic trimeter (Nagy 2015.10.15 §§28–29). At a later point in this same fragmentary poem, we see other such iambic trimeters, the most notable example of which is this verse (<em>Margites</em> F 201.1 ed. West F 4b.1):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>The same verse is attested in a fable, “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” which is embedded in blame poetry attributed to Archilochus (F 201.1 ed. West):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>Such uses of fables in both poetry and prose are suitable for praising or for blaming or simply for warning (BA 280–288; Nagy 2011a §§6–7, 129, 138–146). In the case of “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” Fable 427 (ed. Perry), there is such an element of warning attested in a version attributed to Aesop by Aristotle <em>Rhetoric</em> 2.1393b22–1394a1, who reports that this fable was narrated by Aesop to the people of Samos on the occasion of their impending execution of a ‘demagogue’. [[GN 2017.07.20.]]</p><p>Addendum:</p><p>In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b24–34, Aristotle reconstructs an early phase of praise poetry and blame poetry where praise evolves into epic, as exemplified by the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, while blame evolves into the poetry of playful ridicule, as exemplified by the mock epic <em>Margites</em>, which Aristotle actually attributes to Homer. In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b34–1449a6, Aristotle goes on to argue that the poetry of epic evolved further into tragedy while the poetry of playful ridicule evolved further into comedy (additional comments in Nagy 2015.10.15 §§15–16). In terms of Aristotle’s terminology, then the mock epic <em>Margites</em> can be described as a hybrid form of comedy.

You seem to be a wandering-beggar [<em>alētēs</em>] |19 like me,  and it is the gods who are likely to grant prosperity [<em>olbos</em>].</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from BA 228.) The verb <em>phthoneîn</em> ‘begrudge’ corresponds to the noun <em>phthonos</em> ‘being begrudging’. To begrudge is to feel ungenerous about giving something to someone else to have, or even about accepting a pre-existing situation where someone else already has something that you don’t want for that someone to have—because you want to have it instead. In the praise poetry of Pindar, as at <em>Olympian</em> 8.55, <em>phthonos</em> conventionally applies to blame poetry. In such praise poetry, blame poets are viewed as ungenerously negative about the very thought that someone should be getting praised by praise poetry. It is this kind of <em>phthonos</em> ‘begrudging’ that we find encapsulated in the behavior of Iros toward Odysseus. Picking a quarrel, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> at O.18.009, Iros hurls words of blame against Odysseus. In doing so, he also orders Odysseus to get out of the way, O.18.010, threatening that the present <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ between the two of them, O.18.013, may escalate from verbal to physical violence, Ο.18.010–013. The disguised master of the household refuses to budge from the doorway, answering Iros with the words that I have just quoted from O.18.015–019. There the collocation of <em>olbos</em> ‘prosperity’ at O.18.019 with <em>phthoneîn</em> ‘begrudge’ at O.18.016 and O.18.018 reflects a traditional way of thinking, well attested also in Pindar’s praise poetry, which teaches that prosperity is given by the gods to the righteous—and that this gift is threatened by the unrighteous, who feel begrudging about such god-given prosperity. Ironically, the prosperity of Odysseus himself is now being threatened by the suitors, whose messenger Iros, as a mock Iris, is so begrudging as to hinder our hero from even entering his own household. Without having to identify himself as the real householder, however, Odysseus warns Iros not ‘to be begrudging [<em>phthoneîn</em>] about the property of others’ (ἀλλοτρίων φθονέειν), O.18.018. Such a begrudging attitude on the part of Iros is directly comparable to blame poetry in its function as a traditional negative foil of praise poetry within praise poetry, where the vice of gluttony is pictured as a prime characteristic of blame poetry: hence the saying ‘words are a morsel for those who are begrudging [<em>phthoneroi</em>]’ (ὄψον δὲ λόγοι φθονεροῖσιν) in Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 8.21. In fact, we now see from the Homeric description of Iros that his role as a blame poet is manifested in precisely this sort of gluttony. And the key word is <em>margos</em> &#x27;gluttonous, wanton&#x27;.   </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:18.15-18.19","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"phthoneîn ‘begrudge’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"blame poetry"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"olbos ‘prosperity’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.238289","title":"Odyssey 18.73-74","body":"<p>Even before the physical combat between the disguised Odysseus and Iros takes place, Iros is already losing his nerve as he sees Odysseus half-revealed in the hero’s true form through the intervention of the goddess Athena, O.18.069–071. The reaction of the suitors is to start maliciously gloating over the fear shown by Iros, and the Master Narrator quotes here at O.18.073–074 what any one of the suitors might be saying as they gloat. And what the suitors say is already mocking Iros for failing to live up to his outward appearance of manly strength: the suitors are saying derisively that Iros is really unmanly, not manly. Just as the Master Narrator had previously said—and I highlighted this already in the comment at O.18.001–004—Iros may seem to be <em>megas</em> ‘great, big’ on the outside, O.18.004, but he is ridiculously weak on the inside: that is, he lacks the epic inner quality of īs ‘force, violence, strength’, O.18.003. This quality, so blatantly lacking in the character of Iros, is also indicated by way of the word <em>biē</em> at O.18.04, which means the same thing as does <em>īs</em> at O.18.03: ‘force, violence, strength’. The fear shown by Iros, leading to his defeat at the hands of Odysseus, proves that he really has no <em>īs</em>, no <em>bíē</em>.

The first of these, <em>pepnumenos</em>, is often applied to Telemakhos to indicate his good sense (e.g. O.1.367, O.2.208, O.4.593), whereas <em>epētēs</em> is used in conjunction with adjectives pointing to good sense: <em>angkhinoos</em>, ‘ready of wit’, ‘shrewd’, and <em>ekhephrōn</em>, ‘sensible’, literally, ‘having <em>phrenes</em>’ – and all three are applied to Odysseus, a prime example of possessing a good mind (O.13.322, the only other occurrence of <em>epētēs</em> in Homer). Furthermore, <em>epētēs</em>, especially in the sense ‘very proficient in speech,’ ties in with Amphinomos’ description at O.16.397-398: that he is most pleasing to Penelope when it comes to speech (see also my comment at O.16.397). </p><p>In another passage illustrating Amphinomos’ positive difference from the rest of the suitors, he seconds Telemakhos’ reproach of the suitors’ riotousness at supper and suggestion it is time they go home (O.18.414-421). Amphinomos maintains that Telemakhos is right and proposes a libation before they head home - and here too, his ability at speaking plays a part: what he says is to all <em>ἑαδότα μῦθον</em>, “a pleasing speech” (O.18.422). His good sense not only leads to sensible speech, but his speech is effective, he can persuade his listeners: the suitors leave. So even in one of the suitors – the noblest one – we are shown the connection between good sense and speaking well, and that the first needed for the second.</p><p></p><p>See further:</p><p>Dale, Annette Teffeteller. 1982. “Homeric ἐπητής/ἐπητύς: Meaning and Etymology.” <em>Glotta </em>60:205-214.</p><p>Russo, Joseph, Manuel Fernández-Galiano, and Alfred Heubeck. 1992. <em>A Commentary on Homer’s </em>Odyssey, vol.
