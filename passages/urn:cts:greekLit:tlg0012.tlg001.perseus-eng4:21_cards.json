[{"n":"1","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"1\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"1\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when they came to the ford of the\n    full-flowing river <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName>,\n    begotten of immortal Zeus, Achilles cut their forces in two: one half he chased\n    over the plain towards the city by the same way that the Achaeans had taken\n    when fleeing panic-stricken on the preceding day with Hektor in full triumph;\n    this way did they flee pell-mell, and Hera sent down a thick mist in front of\n    them to stay them. The other half were hemmed in by the deep silver-eddying\n    stream, and fell into it with a great uproar. The waters resounded, and the\n    banks rang again, as they swam hither and thither with loud cries amid the\n    whirling eddies. As locusts flying to a river before the blast of a grass fire-\n    the flame comes on and on till at last it overtakes them and they huddle into\n    the water - even so was the eddying stream of <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> filled with the uproar of men and horses, all\n    struggling in confusion before Achilles. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"17\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith the hero left his spear upon the bank,\n    leaning it against a tamarisk bush, and plunged into the river like a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term>, armed with his sword only. Fell was his\n    purpose as he hewed the Trojans down on every side. Their dying groans rose\n    hideous as the sword smote them, and the river ran red with blood. As when fish\n    flee scared before a huge dolphin, and fill every nook and corner of some fair\n    haven - for he is sure to eat all he can catch - even so did the Trojans cower\n    under the banks of the mighty river, and when Achilles' arms grew weary with\n    killing them,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"27\" unit=\"line\"/>he drew twelve youths alive out of the water, to\n    sacrifice in revenge for Patroklos son of Menoitios. He drew them out like\n    dazed fawns, bound their hands behind them with the belts of their own shirts,\n    and gave them over to his men to take back to the ships. Then he sprang into\n    the river, thirsting for still further blood. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"34\" unit=\"line\"/>There he found Lykaon, son of Priam seed of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Dardanos\">Dardanos</placeName>, as he was escaping\n    out of the water; he it was whom he had once taken prisoner when he was in his\n    father's vineyard, having set upon him by night, as he was cutting young shoots\n    from a wild fig-tree to make the wicker sides of a chariot. Achilles then\n    caught him to his sorrow unawares, and sent him by sea to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011173\">Lemnos</placeName>, where the son of Jason bought him. But\n    a guest-friend, Eetion of Imbros, freed him with a great sum, and sent him to\n    Arisbe, whence he had escaped and returned to his father's house. He had spent\n    eleven days happily with his friends after he had come from <placeName key=\"tgn,7011173\">Lemnos</placeName>, but on the twelfth heaven again\n    delivered him into the hands of Achilles, who was to send him to the house of\n    Hades sorely against his will. He was unarmed when Achilles caught sight of\n    him, and had neither helmet nor shield; nor yet had he any spear, for he had\n    thrown all his armor from him on to the bank, and was sweating with his\n    struggles to get out of the river, so that his strength was now failing him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"54\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Achilles said to himself in his surprise,\n    \"What marvel do I see here? If this man can come back alive after having been\n    sold over into <placeName key=\"tgn,7011173\">Lemnos</placeName>, I shall have\n    the Trojans also whom I have slain rising from the world below. Could not even\n    the waters of the gray sea [pontos] imprison him, as they do many another\n    whether he will or no? This time let him taste my spear, that I may know for\n    certain whether mother earth who can keep even a strong man down, will be able\n    to hold him, or whether thence too he will return.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"64\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he pause and ponder. But Lykaon came up\n    to him dazed and trying hard to embrace his knees, for he would fain live, not\n    die. Achilles thrust at him with his spear, meaning to kill him, but Lykaon ran\n    crouching up to him and caught his knees, whereby the spear passed over his\n    back, and stuck in the ground, hungering though it was for blood. With one hand\n    he caught Achilles' knees as he besought him, and with the other he clutched\n    the spear and would not let it go. Then he said, \"Achilles, have mercy upon me\n    and spare me, for I am your suppliant. It was in your tents that I first broke\n    bread on the day when you took me prisoner in the vineyard; after which you\n    sold away to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011173\">Lemnos</placeName> far from my father\n    and my friends, and I brought you the price of a hundred oxen. I have paid\n    three times as much to gain my freedom; it is but twelve days that I have come\n    to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> after much suffering, and now\n    cruel fate has again thrown me into your hands. Surely father Zeus must hate\n    me, that he has given me over to you a second time. Short of life indeed did my\n    mother Laothoe bear me, daughter of aged Altes - of Altes who reigns over the\n    warlike Leleges and holds steep Pedasos on the river Satnioeis. Priam married\n    his daughter along with many other women and two sons were born of her, both of\n    whom you will have slain. Your spear slew noble Polydoros as he was fighting in\n    the front ranks, and now evil will here befall me, for I fear that I shall not\n    escape you since a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> has delivered me over to\n    you. Furthermore I say, and lay my saying to your heart, spare me, for I am not\n    of the same womb as Hektor who slew your brave and noble comrade.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"97\" unit=\"line\"/>With such words did the princely son of Priam\n    beseech Achilles; but Achilles answered him sternly. \"Idiot,\" said he, \"talk\n    not to me of ransom. Until Patroklos fell I preferred to give the Trojans\n    quarter, and sold beyond the sea many of those whom I had taken alive; but now\n    not a man shall live of those whom heaven delivers into my hands before the\n    city of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> -</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"104\" unit=\"line\"/>and of all Trojans it shall fare hardest with\n    the sons of Priam. Therefore, my friend, you too shall die. Why should you\n    whine in this way? Patroklos fell, and he was a better man than you are. I too\n    - see you not how I am great and goodly? I am son to a noble father, and have a\n    goddess for my mother, but the hands of doom and death overshadow me all as\n    surely. The day will come, either at dawn or dark, or at the noontide, when one\n    shall take my life also in battle, either with his spear, or with an arrow sped\n    from his bow.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"114"},{"n":"114","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"114\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"114\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and Lykaon's heart sank\n    within him. He loosed his hold of the spear, and held out both hands before\n    him; but Achilles drew his keen blade, and struck him by the collar-bone on his\n    neck; he plunged his two-edged sword into him to the very hilt, whereon he lay\n    at full length on the ground, with the dark blood welling from him till the\n    earth was soaked. Then Achilles caught him by the foot and flung him into the\n    river to go down stream, vaunting over him the while, and saying, \"Lie there\n    among the fishes, who will lick the blood from your wound and gloat over it;\n    your mother shall not lay you on any bier to mourn you, but the eddies of\n    Skamandros shall bear you into the broad bosom of the sea. There shall the\n    fishes feed on the fat of Lykaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the\n    waters - so perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> - you in flight, and I following after\n    to destroy you. The river with its broad silver stream shall serve you in no\n    stead, for all the bulls you offered him and all the horses that you flung\n    living into his waters. None the less miserably shall you perish till there is\n    not a man of you but has paid in full for the death of Patroklos and the havoc\n    you wrought among the Achaeans whom you have slain while I held aloof from\n    battle.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"136\" unit=\"line\"/>So spoke Achilles, but the river grew more and\n    more angry, and pondered within himself how he should keep Achilles out of the\n    struggle [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and save the Trojans from\n    disaster. Meanwhile the son of Peleus, spear in hand, sprang upon Asteropaios\n    son of Pelegon to kill him. He was son to the broad river <placeName key=\"tgn,7015932\">Axios</placeName> and Periboia eldest daughter of\n    Akessamenos; for the river had lain with her. Asteropaios stood up out of the\n    water to face him with a spear in either hand, and <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> filled him with courage, being\n    angry for the death of the youths whom Achilles was slaying ruthlessly within\n    his waters. When they were close up with one another Achilles was first to\n    speak. \"Who and whence are you,\" said he, \"who dare to face me? Woe to the\n    parents whose son stands up against me.\" And the son of Pelegon answered,\n    \"Great son of Peleus, why should you ask my lineage. I am from the fertile land\n    of far Paeonia, leader of the Paeonians, and it is now eleven days that I am at\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>. I am of the blood of the\n    river <placeName key=\"tgn,7015932\">Axios</placeName> - of <placeName key=\"tgn,7015932\">Axios</placeName> that is the fairest of all rivers that\n    run. He begot the famed warrior Pelegon, whose son men call me. Let us now\n    fight, Achilles.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"161\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he defy him, and Achilles raised his\n    spear of Pelian ash. Asteropaios failed with both his spears, for he could use\n    both hands alike; with the one spear he struck Achilles' shield, but did not\n    pierce it, for the layer of gold, gift of the god, stayed the point; with the\n    other spear he grazed the elbow of Achilles! right arm drawing dark blood, but\n    the spear itself went by him and fixed itself in the ground, foiled of its\n    bloody banquet. Then Achilles, fain to kill him, hurled his spear at\n    Asteropaios, but failed to hit him and struck the steep bank of the river,\n    driving the spear half its length into the earth. The son of Peleus then drew\n    his sword and sprang furiously upon him. Asteropaios vainly tried to draw\n    Achilles' spear out of the bank by main force; thrice did he tug at it, trying\n    with all his might to draw it out, and thrice he had to leave off trying; the\n    fourth time he tried to bend and break it, but ere he could do so Achilles\n    smote him with his sword and killed him. He struck him in the belly near the\n    navel,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"180\" unit=\"line\"/>so that all his bowels came gushing out on to\n    the ground, and the darkness of death came over him as he lay gasping. Then\n    Achilles set his foot on his chest and spoiled him of his armor, vaunting over\n    him and saying, \"Lie there - begotten of a river though you be, it is hard for\n    you to strive with the offspring of Kronos' son. You declare yourself sprung\n    from the blood of a broad river, but I am of the seed of mighty Zeus. My father\n    is Peleus, son of Aiakos ruler over the many Myrmidons, and Aiakos was the son\n    of Zeus. Therefore as Zeus is mightier than any river that flows into the sea,\n    so are his children stronger than those of any river whatsoever. Moreover you\n    have a great river hard by if he can be of any use to you, but there is no\n    fighting against Zeus the son of Kronos, with whom not even King Akheloos can\n    compare, nor the mighty stream of deep-flowing Okeanos, from whom all rivers\n    and seas with all springs and deep wells proceed; even Okeanos fears the\n    lightnings of great Zeus, and his thunder that comes crashing out of heaven.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>With this he drew his bronze spear out of the\n    bank, and now that he had killed Asteropaios, he let him lie where he was on\n    the sand, with the dark water flowing over him and the eels and fishes busy\n    nibbling and gnawing the fat that was about his kidneys. Then he went in chase\n    of the Paeonians, who were fleeing along the bank of the river in panic when\n    they saw their leader slain by the hands of the son of Peleus. Therein he slew\n    Thersilokhos, Mydon, Astypylos, Mnesos, Thrasios, Oeneus, and Ophelestes, and\n    he would have slain yet others, had not the river in anger taken human form,\n    and spoken to him from out the deep waters saying, \"Achilles, if you excel all\n    in strength, so do you also in wickedness, for the gods are ever with you to\n    protect you: if, then, the son of Kronos has granted it to you to destroy all\n    the Trojans, at any rate drive them out of my stream, and do your grim work on\n    land. My fair waters are now filled with corpses, nor can I find any channel by\n    which I may pour myself into the sea for I am choked with dead, and yet you go\n    on mercilessly slaying. I am in despair, therefore, O leader of your host,\n    trouble me no further.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"222\" unit=\"line\"/>Achilles answered, \"So be it, Skamandros,\n    Zeus-descended; but I will never cease dealing out death among the Trojans,\n    till I have pent them up in their city, and made trial of Hektor face to face,\n    that I may learn whether he is to vanquish me, or I him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"227\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he set upon the Trojans with a fury\n    like that of a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn.</term> But the river said to\n    Apollo, \"Surely, son of Zeus, lord of the silver bow, you are not obeying the\n    commands of Zeus who charged you straitly that you should stand by the Trojans\n    and defend them, till twilight fades, and darkness is over an the earth.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"233\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile Achilles sprang from the bank into\n    mid-stream, whereon the river raised a high wave and attacked him. He swelled\n    his stream into a torrent, and swept away the many dead whom Achilles had slain\n    and left within his waters. These he cast out on to the land, bellowing like a\n    bull the while, but the living he saved alive, hiding them in his mighty\n    eddies. The great and terrible wave gathered about Achilles, falling upon him\n    and beating on his shield, so that he could not keep his feet; he caught hold\n    of a great elm-tree, but it came up by the roots, and tore away the bank,\n    damming the stream with its thick branches and bridging it all across; whereby\n    Achilles struggled out of the stream, and fled full speed over the plain, for\n    he was afraid. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"249"},{"n":"249","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"249\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"249\" unit=\"line\"/>But the mighty god ceased not in his pursuit,\n    and sprang upon him with a dark-crested wave, to keep him out of the struggle\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and save the Trojans from destruction.\n    The son of Peleus darted away a spear's throw from him; swift as the swoop of a\n    black hunter-eagle which is the strongest and fleetest of all birds, even so\n    did he spring forward, and the armor rang loudly about his breast. He fled on\n    in front, but the river with a loud roar came tearing after. As one who would\n    water his garden leads a stream from some fountain over his plants, and all his\n    ground -</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"258\" unit=\"line\"/>spade in hand he clears away the dams to free\n    the channels, and the little stones run rolling round and round with the water\n    as it goes merrily down the bank faster than the man can follow- even so did\n    the river keep catching up with Achilles albeit he was a fleet runner, for the\n    gods are stronger than men. As often as he would strive to stand his ground,\n    and see whether or no all the gods in heaven were in league against him, so\n    often would the mighty wave come beating down upon his shoulders, and he would\n    have to keep fleeing on and on in great dismay; for the angry flood was tiring\n    him out as it flowed past him and ate the ground from under his feet. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"272\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the son of Peleus lifted up his voice to\n    heaven saying, \"Father Zeus, is there none of the gods who will take pity upon\n    me, and save me from the river? I do not care what may happen to me afterwards.\n    I blame [aitios] none of the other dwellers on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> so severely as I do my dear mother, who has beguiled\n    and tricked me. She told me I was to fall under the walls of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> by the flying arrows of Apollo; would\n    that Hektor, the best man among the Trojans, might there slay me; then should I\n    fall a hero by the hand of a hero; whereas now it seems that I shall come to a\n    most pitiable end, trapped in this river as though I were some swineherd's boy,\n    who gets carried down a torrent while trying to cross it during a storm.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"284\" unit=\"line\"/>As soon as he had spoken thus, Poseidon and\n    Athena came up to him in the likeness of two men, and took him by the hand to\n    reassure him. Poseidon spoke first. \"Son of Peleus,\" said he, \"be not so\n    exceeding fearful; we are two gods, come with Zeus' sanction to assist you, I,\n    and Pallas Athena. It is not your fate to perish in this river; he will abate\n    presently as you will see; moreover we strongly advise you, if you will be\n    guided by us, not to stay your hand from fighting till you have pent the Trojan\n    host within the famed walls of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> -\n    as many of them as may escape. Then kill Hektor and go back to the ships, for\n    we will grant you a triumph over him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"298\" unit=\"line\"/>When they had so said they went back to the\n    other immortals, but Achilles strove onward over the plain, encouraged by the\n    charge the gods had laid upon him. All was now covered with the flood of\n    waters, and much goodly armor of the youths that had been slain was rifting\n    about, as also many corpses, but he forced his way against the stream, speeding\n    right onwards, nor could the broad waters stay him, for Athena had endowed him\n    with great strength. Nevertheless Skamandros did not slacken in his pursuit,\n    but was still more furious with the son of Peleus. He lifted his waters into a\n    high crest and cried aloud to Simoeis saying, \"Dear brother, let the two of us\n    unite to save this man, or he will sack the mighty city of King Priam, and the\n    Trojans will not hold out against him. Help me at once; fill your streams with\n    water from their sources, rouse all your torrents to a fury; raise your wave on\n    high, and let snags and stones come thundering down you that we may make an end\n    of this savage creature who is now lording it as though he were a god. Nothing\n    shall serve him longer, not strength nor comeliness, nor his fine armor, which\n    indeed shall soon be lying low in the deep waters covered over with mud. I will\n    wrap him in sand, and pour tons of shingle round him, so that the Achaeans\n    shall not know how to gather his bones for the silt in which I shall have\n    hidden him, and when they celebrate his funeral they need build no tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"324\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he upraised his tumultuous flood high\n    against Achilles, seething as it was with foam and blood and the bodies of the\n    dead. The dark waters of the river stood upright and would have overwhelmed the\n    son of Peleus, but Hera, trembling lest Achilles should be swept away in the\n    mighty torrent, lifted her voice on high and called out to Hephaistos her son.\n    \"Crook-foot,\" she cried, \"my child, be up and doing, for I deem it is with you\n    that <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> is fain to fight;\n    help us at once, kindle a fierce fire; I will then bring up the west and the\n    white south wind in a mighty gale from the sea,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"335\" unit=\"line\"/>that shall bear the flames against the heads\n    and armor of the Trojans and consume them, while you go along the banks of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> burning his trees and\n    wrapping him round with fire.

As the north wind, blowing on an orchard\n    that has been sodden with autumn rain, soon dries it, and the heart of the\n    owner is glad - even so the whole plan was dried and the dead bodies were\n    consumed. Then he turned tongues of fire on to the river. He burned the elms\n    the willows and the tamarisks, the lotus also, with the rushes and marshy\n    herbage that grew abundantly by the banks of the river. The eels and fishes\n    that go darting about everywhere in the water, these, too, were sorely harassed\n    by the flames that cunning Hephaistos had kindled, and the river himself was\n    scalded, so that he spoke saying, \"Hephaistos, there is no god can hold his own\n    against you.

They fell on one another with a mighty uproar - earth groaned, and\n    the spacious firmament rang out as with a blare of trumpets. Zeus heard as he\n    was sitting on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, and laughed\n    for joy when he saw the gods coming to blows among themselves. They were not\n    long about beginning, and Ares piercer of shields opened the battle. Sword in\n    hand he sprang at once upon Athena and reviled her. \"Why, vixen,\" said he,\n    \"have you again set the gods by the ears in the pride and haughtiness of your\n    heart?

When Queen Hera saw her, she said to Athena, \"Look,\n    daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable, that vixen Aphrodite is again\n    taking Ares through the crowd out of the battle; go after her at once.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"424"},{"n":"424","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"424\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"424\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus she spoke. Athena sped after Aphrodite\n    with a will, and made at her, striking her on the bosom with her strong hand so\n    that she fell fainting to the ground, and there they both lay stretched at full\n    length. Then Athena vaunted over her saying, \"May all who help the Trojans\n    against the Argives prove just as redoubtable and stalwart as Aphrodite did\n    when she came across me while she was helping Ares.

Meanwhile King\n    Poseidon turned to Apollo saying, \"Phoebus, why should we keep each other at\n    arm's length? it is not well, now that the others have begun fighting; it will\n    be disgraceful to us if we return to Zeus' bronze-floored mansion on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> without having fought each other;\n    therefore come on, you are the younger of the two, and I ought not to attack\n    you, for I am older and have had more experience.

I built\n    the Trojans the wall about their city, so wide and fair that it might be\n    impregnable, while you, Phoebus, herded cattle for him in the dales of many\n    valleyed Ida.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"449\" unit=\"line\"/>When, however, the glad hours [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôrai</term>] brought round the time-limit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">telos</term>] for payment, mighty Laomedon robbed us of all\n    our hire and sent us off with nothing but abuse. He threatened to bind us hand\n    and foot and sell us over into some distant island. He tried, moreover, to cut\n    off the ears of both of us, so we went away in a rage, furious about the\n    payment he had promised us, and yet withheld; in spite of all this, you are now\n    showing favor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharis</term>] to his people, and will not\n    join us in compassing the utter ruin of the proud Trojans with their wives and\n    children.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"462\" unit=\"line\"/>And King Apollo answered, \"Lord of the\n    earthquake, you would not think me moderate [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sôphrôn</term>] if I were to fight you about a pack of miserable mortals,\n    who come out like leaves in summer and eat the fruit of the field, and\n    presently fall lifeless to the ground.

But his sister the huntress Artemis,\n    patroness of wild beasts, was very angry with him and said, \"So you would flee,\n    Far-Darter, and hand victory over to Poseidon with a cheap vaunt to boot. Baby,\n    why keep your bow thus idle? Never let me again hear you bragging in my\n    father's house, as you have often done in the presence of the immortals, that\n    you would stand up and fight with Poseidon.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"478\" unit=\"line\"/>Apollo made her no answer, but Zeus' august\n    queen was angry and upbraided her bitterly. \"Bold vixen,\" she cried, \"how dare\n    you cross me thus? For all your bow you will find it hard to hold your own\n    against me. Zeus made you as a lion among women, and lets you kill them\n    whenever you choose. You will And it better to chase wild beasts and deer upon\n    the mountains than to fight those who are stronger than you are.

Her swift arrows were shed upon the ground, and she\n    fled weeping from under Hera's hand as a dove that flies before a falcon to the\n    cleft of some hollow rock, when it is her good fortune to escape. Even so did\n    she flee weeping away, leaving her bow and arrows behind her. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"497\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the slayer of <placeName key=\"perseus,Argos\">Argos</placeName>, guide and guardian, said to Leto,\n    \"Leto, I shall not fight you; it is ill to come to blows with any of Zeus'\n    wives.

Artemis had now reached Zeus' bronze-floored\n    mansion on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, and sat herself\n    down with many tears on the knees of her father, while her ambrosial raiment\n    was quivering all about her. The son of Kronos drew her towards him, and\n    laughing pleasantly the while began to question her saying, \"Which of the\n    heavenly beings, my dear child, has been treating you in this cruel manner, as\n    though you had been misconducting yourself in the face of everybody?\" and the\n    fair-crowned goddess of the chase answered, \"It was your wife Hera, father, who\n    has been beating me; it is always her doing when there is any quarreling among\n    the immortals.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"514\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did they converse, and meanwhile Phoebus\n    Apollo entered the strong city of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, for he was uneasy lest the wall should not hold out and\n    the Danaans should take the city then and there, before its hour had come; but\n    the rest of the ever-living gods went back, some angry and some triumphant to\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, where they took their\n    seats beside Zeus lord of the storm cloud, while Achilles still kept on dealing\n    out death alike on the Trojans and on their As when the smoke from some burning\n    city ascends to heaven when the anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>] of\n    the gods has kindled it - there is then toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] for all, and sorrow for not a few - even so did Achilles bring\n    toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and sorrow on the Trojans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"526\" unit=\"line\"/>Old King Priam stood on a high tower of the\n    wall looking down on huge Achilles as the Trojans fled panic-stricken before\n    him, and there was none to help them. Presently he came down from off the tower\n    and with many a groan went along the wall to give orders to the brave warders\n    of the gate. \"Keep the gates,\" said he, \"wide open till the people come fleeing\n    into the city, for Achilles is hard by and is driving them in rout before him.\n    I see we are in great peril. As soon as our people are inside and in safety,\n    close the strong gates for I fear lest that terrible man should come bounding\n    inside along with the others.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"537\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke they drew back the bolts and opened\n    the gates, and when these were opened there was a haven of refuge for the\n    Trojans. Apollo then came full speed out of the city to meet them and protect\n    them. Right for the city and the high wall, parched with thirst and grimy with\n    dust, still they hurried on, with Achilles wielding his spear furiously behind\n    them. For he was as one possessed, and was thirsting after glory. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"544\" unit=\"line\"/>Then had the sons of the Achaeans taken the\n    lofty gates of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> if Apollo had not\n    spurred on Agenor, valiant and noble son to Antenor. He put courage into his\n    heart, and stood by his side to guard him, leaning against a beech tree and\n    shrouded in thick darkness. When Agenor saw Achilles he stood still and his\n    heart was clouded with care. \"Alas,\" said he to himself in his dismay, \"if I\n    flee before mighty Achilles, and go where all the others are being driven in\n    rout, he will none the less catch me and kill me for a coward. How would it be\n    were I to let Achilles drive the others before him, and then flee from the wall\n    to the plain that is behind <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"558\" unit=\"line\"/>till I reach the spurs of Ida and can hide in\n    the underwood that is thereon? I could then wash the sweat from off me in the\n    river and in the evening return to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>. But why commune with myself in this way? Like enough he\n    would see me as I am hurrying from the city over the plain, and would speed\n    after me till he had caught me - I should stand no chance against him, for he\n    is mightiest of all humankind. What, then, if I go out and meet him in front of\n    the city? His flesh too, I take it, can be pierced by pointed bronze. Life\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] is the same in one and all, and men say\n    that he is but mortal despite the triumph that Zeus son of Kronos grants him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"571\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying he stood on his guard and awaited\n    Achilles, for he was now fain to fight him. As a leopardess that bounds from\n    out a thick covert to attack a hunter - she knows no fear and is not dismayed\n    by the baying of the hounds; even though the man be too quick for her and wound\n    her either with thrust or spear, still, though the spear has pierced her she\n    will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been killed\n    outright - even so did noble Agenor son of Antenor refuse to flee till he had\n    made trial of Achilles, and took aim at him with his spear, holding his round\n    shield before him and crying with a loud voice. \"Of a truth,\" said he, \"noble\n    Achilles, you deem that you shall this day sack the city of the proud Trojans.\n    Fool, there will be trouble enough yet before it, for there is many a brave man\n    of us still inside who will stand in front of our dear parents with our wives\n    and children, to defend <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>. Here\n    therefore, huge and mighty warrior though you be, here shall you cue. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"590\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke his strong hand hurled his javelin\n    from him, and the spear struck Achilles on the leg beneath the knee; the greave\n    of newly wrought tin rang loudly, but the spear recoiled from the body of him\n    whom it had struck, and did not pierce it, for the gods gift stayed it.\n    Achilles in his turn attacked noble Agenor, but Apollo would not grant him\n    glory,</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"596"},{"n":"596","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"596\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"596\" unit=\"line\"/>for he snatched Agenor away and hid him in a\n    thick mist, sending him out of the battle unmolested Then he craftily drew the\n    son of Peleus away from going after the host, for he put on the semblance of\n    Agenor and stood in front of Achilles, who ran towards him to give him chase\n    and pursued him over the wheat lands of the plain, turning him towards the deep\n    waters of the river Skamandros. Apollo ran but a little way before him and\n    beguiled Achilles by making him think all the time that he was on the point of\n    overtaking him. Meanwhile the rabble of routed Trojans was thankful to crowd\n    within the city till their numbers thronged it; no longer did they dare wait\n    for one another outside the city walls, to learn who had escaped and who were\n    fallen in fight, but all whose feet and knees could still carry them poured\n    pell-mell into the town. <milestone n=\"611\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
