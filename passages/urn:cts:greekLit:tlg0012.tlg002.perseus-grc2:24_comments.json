It is as if the second epic, the <em>Odyssey</em>, could now restart before it ends by reaching back into the first epic, the <em>Iliad</em>. Still, there will be no restart here. The plot of that first epic had started with a grand feud between Achilles and Agamemnon, but the plot of the second epic will now come to an end with a resolution of that feud. The feuding is over, so that the two main characters of the <em>Iliad</em> can now take time to review not only what happened in the <em>Iliad</em> but also, beyond the <em>Iliad</em>, how the two of them died, each his own way. Since they are now dead, they have to speak ghost to ghost, but that is not enough for Agamemnon. He must also speak with the new ghosts, the suitors, who will now give him a retrospective on the <em>Odyssey</em>. This way, Agamemnon can compare the story of his own life with the stories of both Odysseus and Achilles. And the comparison must be most depressing for him. But the Odyssey does not end with the sad thoughts of Agamemnon. Odysseus still has to reconnect with his own ancestors, and so there needs to be a final recognition scene between the son and his father Laertes. But even after this reconnection of the generations is finally achieved, the story is still not done. The feuding that has been triggered by the killing of the suitors must end; otherwise, the story cannot end.</p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/T11219_10_1280.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>“Mercury Conducting the Souls of the Suitors to the Infernal Regions” (1805).

Another way to think of these two distinct worlds is picture consciousness on one side and unconsciousness on the other side. Situated between these two worlds here are five mythological landmarks: the cosmic river Ōkeanos, O.24.011; the White Rock (<em>leukas petrā</em>), O.24.011; the Gates (<em>pulai</em>) of Hēlios the Sun, O.24.012; the District (<em>dēmos</em>) of Dreams (<em>oneiroi</em>), O.24.012, and, finally, the Meadow (<em>leimōn</em>) of Asphodel (the flower <em>asphodelos</em>). In other Homeric contexts, it would be sufficient for only one of these five landmarks, the Ōkeanos, to figure as a separator of light and life from darkness and death, of consciousness from unconsciousness. See especially the comments at O.10.508–512 O.11.012–019, O.11.020–022, O.12.001–004. In the present context, four other separators are listed, each one of which can be considered a multiform that has the same kind of built-in function of referring to a separator and a meeting-point between two opposite worlds. In Homeric poetry, there is no other attestation of the White Rock or of the District of Dreams, although other poetry shows traces of such landmarks (as in Alcman PMG 1.45–49; comments at GMP 224). But Homeric poetry does refer elsewhere to the Gates of the Sun: see the comments at I.05.395–404, I.05.646, I.11.671–761, I.23.071–076, O.04.809; see also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on the Gates of Hādēs and the anchor comment at I.23.071–076 on what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos really wants for itself—and for Achilles (Points 5 and 6 and 9).

Elsewhere in Homeric diction, I.23.072 and O.11.476, this same description applies to disembodied spirits of the dead who populate a mystical place that resembles what is known in other contexts as Hādēs. But the Meadow of Asphodel is not exactly Hādēs. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, this Meadow is where the spirit of Achilles himself abides, O.11.539. Also, at O.11.573, the Meadow of Asphodel is pictured as a “happy hunting ground”—to borrow an image from the Great Plains tribes of native Americans—where the great hunter Orion can hunt for all time to his heart’s content, O.11.572–575. In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em>, verses 221 and 344, the same Meadow of Asphodel becomes a pathway for the Cattle of the Sun after Hermes steals this solar herd from Apollo. And now, as we see here at O.O.24.013 just as we saw earlier at O.11.539, the Meadow of Asphodel is once again featured as the place where the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles is to be found: here he is, in the company of other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’, who are listed in the following order: Patroklos, Antilokhos, Ajax, O.24.015–018. In this same context, Ajax is described as the second-best of the Achaeans, after Achilles, O.24.017–018. This company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ is now joined by the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon, who is coming from some other direction, at the head of another company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’—those who had been killed together with Agamemnon by Aigisthos after they had made their way back home from Troy, O.24.021–022. At this point, we might have expected the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon to address the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors, asking them directly: how did <em>you</em> all die? And then I will tell you how we died. But such a dialogue is postponed till O.24.099–105. Instead, here at O.24.023, it is Achilles himself—or, let us say, it is his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’—who initiates a dialogue with the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon. You would think that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles had only now for the first time encountered the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon since he died. But, as we will see at O.24.024–034, Achilles already knows what happened to Agamemnon and to his followers after they had made their way back home from Troy: they died an ignominious death, through the treachery of Aigisthos. Conversely, as we will see at O.24.036–097, Agamemnon already knows what happened to Achilles: he never went home because he died at Troy, but his glorious death there earned him the greatest honors.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.14-24.23","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Meadow of Asphodel"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhai ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē of Agamemnon"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē ‘spirit’ of Achilles"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"'best of the Achaeans'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"meeting-place for psūkhai ‘spirits’ of Achilles, Patroklos, Antilokhos, Ajax"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aigisthos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.249438","title":"Odyssey 24.016","body":"<p>On the parallelism of Antilokhos and Patroklos as dearest companions of Achilles, see especially the comment at I.23.326–343.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.16","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"parallelism of Antilokhos and Patroklos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.249491","title":"Odyssey 24.023-098","body":"<p>Although the gender of <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ in referring here to the spirits of Achilles and Agamemnon is feminine, O.24.023 and O.24.035, the pronouns referring to the two dead heroes in the narrative that frames their dialogue continue to show the masculine gender, and the use of the feminine gender is discontinued altogether in the wording of the actual I-you dialogue: instead, as Achilles and Agamemnon proceed to speak to each other at O.24.024–034 and at O.24.036–097 respectively, they revert in their I-you dialogue to the masculine gender that they once had owned as speakers in Homeric narrative.

The narrative here at O.24.036–097 is pervaded by references to the hero cult of Achilles. I offer here a brief inventory of some of these references:</p><p>—O.24.036, ὄλβιε Πηλέος υἱέ, θεοῖσ’ ἐπιείκελ’ Ἀχιλλεῦ ‘O you <em>olbios</em> son of Peleus, godlike Achilles’. So, Agamemnon here addresses Achilles as <em>olbios</em>, which would mean ‘fortunate’ on the surface. Beneath the surface, however, <em>olbios</em> here can be interpreted as ‘blessed’, referring to the sacred status of a cult hero: see the comment at O.19.107–114, with special reference to uses of <em>olbios</em> in the sense of ‘blessed’, as at verse 172 of the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>.</p><p>—O.037–039, ἀμφὶ δέ σ’ ἄλλοι | κτείνοντο Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν υἷες ἄριστοι | μαρνάμενοι περὶ σεῖο ‘On all sides of you [= your corpse], the rest of them | were being slaughtered, sons of both Trojans and Achaeans, the best, | as they were fighting over you [= your corpse]’. The Achaeans and the Trojans are battling here over the possession of the corpse of Achilles. The mentality of needing to possess the body of the dead hero, whether he was a friend or an enemy in life, is typical of hero cults, in that the corpse of the cult hero was viewed as a talisman of fertility and prosperity for the community that gained possession of the hero’s body. Details in PH 32, 178; also Nagy 2006 §97.</p><p>—O.24.039–40, σὺ δ’ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης | κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί ‘There you were, lying in a swirl of dust. | You lay there so huge in all your hugeness’. The corpse of Achilles is described here as larger than life. This wording applies to Achilles also at I.18.026–027, where he stages himself as a corpse in mourning the death of Patroklos and where he is mourned by Thetis as if he were already a corpse: see the comment at I.018.070–071 (see also BA 113, especially with reference to I.18.071). At I.16.775–776, cognate wording applies to the corpse of the hero Kebriones. The corpse of Achilles is described as nine cubits long in the <em>Alexandra</em> of Lycophron (860). As we see from lore preserved in the historical period about cult heroes, they were conventionally pictured as far larger in death than they had been in life. Among the most striking examples is the corpse of Orestes as cult hero, described in Herodotus 1.68.</p><p>—O.24.059, περὶ δ’ ἄμβροτα εἵματα ἕσσαν ‘They [= the Nereids] dressed you [= your corpse] in immortalizing clothes’. At the funeral of Achilles, his divine mother and her sister Nereids dress the hero’s corpse in ‘immortalizing’ clothes. On the vital importance of understanding <em>ambrotos</em> as ‘immortalizing’ as well as ‘immortal’, see the comments at I.16.670 and I.16.680; details in GMP 141.</p><p>—O.24.073–077. After the cremation of the corpse of Achilles, his bones and those of the already cremated corpse of Patroklos are placed into a golden jar that had been given by the god Dionysus to the goddess Thetis. This jar, as we know from the comparative evidence of other poetic references (especially Stesichorus PMG 234), is a sign of the hero’s immortalization after death. See BA 209; also Dué 2001.</p><p>—O.24.085–086. After the making of the tumulus which will be the tomb shared by Achilles and Patroklos, O.24.080–084, funeral games are held in honor of Achilles. The details of this description match closely the details we can gather from historical evidence about athletic contests held in honor of cult heroes. Details in BA 116–117.</p><p>—O.24.091. The athletic contests at the funeral games of Achilles and the prizes to be won in these contests are instituted for the purpose of compensating for his death, and, in this verse, such an act of compensation is expressed by way of the prepositional phrase <em>epi soi</em> (ἐπὶ σοί), which can be translated roughly as ‘in your honor’. As we can see clearly from a variety of prose sources, the syntactical construct combining the preposition <em>epi</em> with the dative case of a given hero’s name refers to the cult of that hero. (Details in PH 121.) Perhaps the most striking example is this entry in the dictionary attributed to Hesychius: ‘<em>balletus</em>: a festival event at Athens, held in honor of Demophon son of Keleos’ (Βαλλητύς· ἑορτὴ Ἀθήνησιν, ἐπὶ Δημοφῶντι τῷ Κελεοῦ ἀγομένη).</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.36-24.97","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"retrospective on the story about Achilles at Troy"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hero cult of Achilles"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.249779","title":"Odyssey 24 48","body":"<p>Here in <em>Odyssey</em> 24.46, the Achaeans cut their hair at the funeral of Achilles. This ritual gesture, GN argues, signals a symbolic transition from long-haired Achaeans to short-haired Greeks, corresponding to a transition from the heroic age to a post heroic-age. See H24H 14§26a. Commenting on the post-heroic era that follows the death of Achilles, the Ampelourgos says: οὐδὲ κομᾶν ἔτι μετὰ τὸν Ἀχιλλέα καλὸν ἡγούμενοι ‘no longer could they [= the Achaeans] consider it a beautiful thing to grow their hair long, once Achilles was gone’ (Philostratus <em>Hērōikos</em> 51.13). The wording connotes an aetiology, as if the death of Achilles were the single reason that explains why adult men of the post-heroic age no longer wore their hair long - except for such notable counter-examples as the Spartans. The wearing of long hair was a distinctive sign of pre-adult status. Even in the Iliad, the long hair of Achilles ostentatiously signals his pre-adult status, as we can see from the scene describing the funeral of Patroklos, where Achilles cuts off his long blond hair as he stands at the funeral pyre of his best friend (23.141). It is at this same place where the tumulus to be shared by Patroklos and Achilles will be built when the time comes for the funeral of Achilles himself (23.126). In this Homeric scene, as Achilles is standing on the heights of the promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his own body, he wistfully looks out over the seas of the outer Hellespont, fixing his gaze toward the far west, in the direction of his native land of Thessaly, and longing for the river Sperkheios that flows through that distant land: it was to the waters of that river, which he will never live to see again, that he had hoped to sacrifice his long hair after he came of age and was ready to cut it (23.142-153). But now Achilles cuts off his long hair prematurely and unseasonally as he stands there at the Asiatic promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his body (23.142). [See also GN HPC 166 = II§85.] And now the Achaean comrades of Achilles follow his example and likewise cut off their hair (23.135-136). So also in the wording that I have just highlighted from the <em>Hērōikos</em> of Philostratus, we see a reference to this ritual of coming of age: now that Achilles is dead, adult males of the future will be wearing their hair short, no longer long. It is as if all the ‘sons of the Achaeans’ were now ready to shift from pre-adult to adult status - now that Achilles is dead and buried. So, now, the <em>huies Akhaiōn</em>, ‘sons of the Achaeans’, as the Achaean warriors are regularly called in the Iliad (1.162 and so on) have reached a post-heroic maturity that inaugurates a post-heroic age.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.48","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"},{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"},{"name":"Casey Dué Hackney","email":"cldue@central.uh.edu","username":"cldue"},{"name":"Corinne Pache","email":"cpache@trinity.edu","username":"cpache"},{"name":"David Elmer","email":"delmer@fas.harvard.edu","username":"delmer"},{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"},{"name":"Laura Slatkin","email":"LAURA.SLATKIN@nyu.edu","username":"lslatkin"},{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"},{"name":"mebbott","email":"mebbott@holycross.edu","username":"mebbott"},{"name":"Olga Levaniouk","email":"olevan@u.washington.edu","username":"olevaniouk"},{"name":"Richard Martin","email":"rpmartin@stanford.edu","username":"rmartin"},{"name":"Thomas Walsh","email":"trwalsh@berkeley.edu","username":"twalsh"},{"name":"Yiannis Petropoulos","email":"yiannis@chs.harvard.edu","username":"ypetropoulos"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.249833","title":"Odyssey 24.058-24.061","body":"<p>The goddess Thetis and her sister Nereids, as the family of Achilles, are lamenting Achilles: presumably, their singing can be described as <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, as I infer by comparing the use of this word in referring to the laments performed by Hector’s family at I.24.723 / I.24.747 (also at I.24.760) / I. 24.761.

In the direct references that we see in the <em>Iliad</em>, it is made clear that this tomb starts off as a small-scale structure, located at the same place where a funeral pyre is constructed for the cremation of the body of Patroklos, and that the original function of this tomb is to enclose the bones of that hero after his body is cremated. But it is also made clear, in both the direct and the indirect references as we see them in the <em>Iliad</em>, that this same tomb will in a future time enclose the bones of Achilles as well, which will then be mixed together with the bones of Patroklos inside a golden jar. In this future time, when Achilles too is dead, it will be his own body that will need to be cremated at the same place and then entombed in the same structure. For this new entombment to happen, however, the small-scale structure that had enveloped the bones of Patroklos will now grow into a large-scale structure, exponentially larger than the original.

See the anchor comments at I.23.125–126 and at I.23.245–248. Here at O.24.076–084, however, where we find the third and most detailed direct reference to the same tomb, it becomes clear that (A) this structure belongs primarily to Achilles and (B) the cremation and entombment of Patroklos were designed all along to prefigure the cremation and entombment of Achilles. Even in the <em>Iliad</em>, the two indirect references to the tomb show that Achilles is the primary occupant of the structure: see the comments on I.07.067–091 and on I.19.373–380.</p><p>Point 2. In the direct references that we find at I.23.125–126 and at I.23.245–248, it is made clear that this tomb starts off as a small-scale structure, located at the same place where a funeral pyre is constructed for cremating the body of Patroklos, and that the original function of this tomb is to enclose the bones of that hero after his body is cremated. But it is also made clear, not only in the direct references at I.23.125–126 and I.23.245–248 but also in the indirect references at I.07.067–091 and I.19.373–380, that this same tomb will in a future time enclose the bones of Achilles as well, which will then be mixed together with the bones of Patroklos inside a golden jar that had been given by the god Dionysus to the mother of Achilles, I.23.092. In this future time, when Achilles too is dead, it will be his own body that will need to be cremated at the same place and then entombed inside the same structure.</p><p>Point 3. Once the cremation of Achilles is completed, O.23.071, the bones of the hero are mixed with the bones of Patroklos and placed inside the golden jar, gift of Dionysus, that Thetis has now brought to the funeral, O.24.072–077. That golden jar signals a future of immortalization for Achilles and, by extension, for Patroklos, whose <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ had originally indicated the need for the bones of both heroes to be stored inside the golden jar, I.23.092 (BA 209–210). Now that the bones are safely stored in the golden jar, the two heroes must be entombed together. For this new entombment to happen, however, the small-scale structure that had enveloped the bones of Patroklos will now grow into a large-scale structure, exponentially larger than the original. As noted in the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257, the entombment of Achilles together with Patroklos will now lead to an upgrading of the tomb, the size of which will become spectacular in both height and width, I.23.246–247. And it is this large-scale structure, in all its splendor, that we see pictured in <em>Odyssey</em> 24.</p><p>Point 4. The structure is a <em>tumbos</em> ‘tomb’, O.24.080, which is ‘heaped up’ by the Achaean=Argive warriors to entomb the bones of Achilles and Patroklos, O.24.081: so the tomb is a tumulus. And this tumulus is situated on top of a high promontory that looks out over the sea of the Hellespont, O.24.082, so that it may shine from afar as a beacon light of salvation for all those who sail through the troubled waters of that dangerous sea—not only ‘now’ in the heroic past but also in the post-heroic future, O.24.083–084. The time frame indicated as ‘now’ here is the era of the heroes who fought in the Trojan War, but the future is of course the ever movable here-and-now of Homeric reception (Nagy 2012:48). Already at I.23.248, Achilles makes a pointed reference to the Achaeans of the future who will be sailing past the promontory on top of which his tomb is located and marveling at the sight of the structure, which is called a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ at I.23.257. See the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257.</p><p>Point 5. By now we can picture the tomb of Achilles, situated on a promontory overlooking the dangerous sea of the Hellespont, as a magnificent structure resembling a splendid lighthouse. There is a comparable image to be seen at I.19.373–380: in these verses, which refer indirectly to the tomb of Achilles, the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from the bright surface of the hero’s Shield, I.19.374, is compared to a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from a fire that sends forth its light from a lighthouse, I.19.375. See the comment on I.19.373–380. As I note in the comment there, this saving light is described as holding forth a promise of salvation for sailors lost at sea who are longing to be reunited with their loved ones at home, I.19.375, I.19.377–378. And this light is said to be streaming from a fire that is burning at a remote place described here as a solitary <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ situated in the heights overlooking the dangerous seas below, I.19.376–377. To picture the tomb of Achilles as a <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ that shelters herdsmen and that protects sailors is another traditional way of viewing the sacred place where the hero Achilles once lived and died. See the comments on I.18.587–589 and I.19.373–380.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.76-24.84","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.249963","title":"Odyssey 24.76-24.77","body":"<p>comment on the identification of Patroklos with Achilles</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.76-24.77","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.250010","title":"Odyssey 24.80-24.84","body":"<p>I.12.030-032 (rivers smoothing over the area by the Hellespont) as a variant of the tradition that Achaeans made a funeral mound for Achilles by the Hellespont in these verses, in the context of analyzing the obliteration of the “props” that mark an Achaean expedition against Troy, and the irony of Xanthos/Skamandros’ threat to bury Achilles under a mound of silt</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.80-24.84","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.250058","title":"Odyssey 24.080-24.084","body":"<p>The location of the tomb of Achilles on a promontory looking out over the Hellespont is consistent with the visualizations of this tomb in the <em>Iliad</em>.

At O.24.197, I translate ‘his merit’, not ‘her merit’, interpreting this instance of <em>aretē</em> ‘merit’ at verse 197 as referring to the previous instance, at verse 193. At O.24.198, the epithet for <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ is <em>khariessa</em> ‘having <em>kharis</em>’, and I interpret the concept of <em>kharis</em> as ‘beautiful and pleasurable recompense’ in this context. On <em>kharis</em> as a word that conveys both beauty and pleasure, see <em>HC</em> 2§33. At O.24.202, <em>thēluterai</em> means not ‘more female’ but rather ‘female—as opposed to male’.</p><p>Further commentary at BA 36–38. </p><p>(What follows is an epitome of H24H 11§23, §§26–27.) The word <em>olbios</em> that we see being used here in the first verse seems at first ambivalent: we cannot be sure whether it means ‘fortunate’ or ‘blessed’. While a hero like Odysseus is still alive, it is dangerous for him to be described as <em>olbios</em> in the sense of ‘blessed’. A negative example of what can happen is the case of the hero Priam. Most telling are the words that Achilles addresses to him at I.24.543: ‘I hear that you, old man, were once upon a time <em>olbios</em>’ (καὶ σὲ γέρον τὸ πρὶν μὲν ἀκούομεν ὄλβιον εἶναι). When Achilles is saying this to Priam, the old man is experiencing the worst moments of his life. During those moments, he is neither fortunate nor blessed. Only after death could Priam ever become truly <em>olbios</em>. In the case of Odysseus, however, the <em>Odyssey</em> shows that this Homeric hero is ultimately not only fortunate but also blessed, and so the epithet <em>olbios</em> will in fact ultimately apply to him.</p><p>As we see here in O.24.192–202, Odysseus owes his successful homecoming to the faithfulness of his wife Penelope, who deserves only praise, O.24.193–198. And it is in this context of success that Agamemnon addresses Odysseus as <em>olbios</em>, ‘blessed’, O.24.192. By contrast, Agamemnon blames his own wife Clytemnestra for sabotaging his own ‘homecoming’ or <em>nostos</em>, O.24.096. Agamemnon contrasts his loss of ‘homecoming’ or <em>nostos</em> with the poetic ‘glory’ or <em>kleos</em> that Achilles will keep forever, O.24.094. But now, in O.24.192–202, we see that Agamemnon makes another basic contrast—between himself and Odysseus. What caused Agamemnon to lose his own <em>kleos</em>—and his own <em>nostos</em>—was the fact that his wife was Clytemnestra, who was unfaithful to him and who contrived his murder, O.24.199-202. By contrast, the faithfulness of Penelope to Odysseus helped that hero secure his own <em>kleos</em>, O.24.196, in the context of O.24.196–198. To add to the irony, Agamemnon’s words describe his violent death as <em>lugros</em>, ‘disastrous’, O.24.096, and his wife Clytemnestra as <em>oulomenē</em>, ‘disastrous’, O.24.097. Both of these epithets, as we have seen earlier, are words that evoke the poetry of epic: <em>lugros</em>, ‘disastrous’, is the epithet of both the <em>nostos</em> or ‘song about homecoming’ that Phemios sings in O.01.327 and of the <em>nostos</em> that Nestor narrates in O.03.132, while <em>oulomenē</em>, ‘disastrous’, is the epithet of the anger of Achilles in I.01.002.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.192-24.202","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"olbios 'blessed' (or 'fortunate')"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.250551","title":"Odyssey 24.192-202","body":"<p>  </p><p>These words of Agamemnon show that the likeminded couple, Penelope and Odysseus (cp. O.6.181-184), is worthy of <a class=\"comment-cross-ref\" href=\"/tags/kleos\">#kleos</a>, a glorious epic song – and what is more, this <em>kleos</em> is characterized by <a class=\"comment-cross-ref\" href=\"/tags/kharis\">#kharis</a>. His praise makes the source of <em>kleos</em> in the <em>Odyssey</em> explicit. It is the mind (<em>phrenes</em>, O.24.194) of Penelope and her remembering Odysseus (O.24.195) that is worthy of celebration. And it is, again, a <em>much contriving</em> Odysseus (O.24.192), his epithet pointing to his mental abilities, who has the luck of having Penelope as his wife. Although what exactly the <em>arēte</em>, ‘excellence’ (O.24.193, O.24.197), that both gives rise to this song and is its subject, is <em>in</em>, is left somewhat ambiguous, or even whether it is the <em>arēte</em> of Penelope or Odysseus – or, as I would like to take it, of the couple together – we can see that mental abilities are central to it, and throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>, the couple standing out for theirs are Penelope and Odysseus. </p><p>Further, Agamemnon’s words show the connection between the worthy achievements and their commemoration in song very clearly. Agamemnon speaks specifically of songs and reputation conveyed through them, contrasting Penelope with Klytaimestra. The balance of the comparison of the two women creates an effect of symmetrical opposition. As Penelope is called <em>κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου</em>, “daughter of Ikarios” (O.24.195), so Klytaimestra is <em>Τυνδαρέου κούρη</em>, “daughter of Tyndareos” (O.24.199), both named through their fathers, but with the word order reversed as if to draw out the contrast between them. While Penelope <em>εὖ μέμνητ’ Ὀδυσῆος, / ἀνδρὸς κουριδίου</em>, “well remembered Odysseus, her wedded husband” (O.24.195-196), Klytaimestra <em>κακὰ μήσατο ἔργα, / κουρίδιον κτείνασα πόσιν</em>, “devised her evil deeds, killing her wedded husband” (O.24.199-200). In both cases, the object of the wife’s action is her respective husband, both times qualified by “wedded” (there is perhaps even a suggestion of further parallelism in the alliterative echoing in <em>memnēt’</em>, ‘remembered’, and <em>mēsato</em>, ‘devised’). As Penelope occasions <em>κλέος</em>, “song of glory,” and <em>ἀοιδὴν / […] χαρίεσσαν</em>, “<em>kharis</em>-filled song,” to delight mortals (O.24.196-198), so Klytaimestra gives rise to <em>στυγερὴ […] ἀοιδὴ</em>, “hateful song,” among humans (O.24.200-201), the words and phrases mirroring one another again. The parallelism and even repetitions of specific words and phrases concretely demonstrates the opposition between the two kinds of song, the praise poetry of epic on one hand, and the blame poetry on the other. </p><p>Finally, <em>khalepe</em>, ‘grievous’, ‘harsh’, ‘hard to bear’, that qualifies the repute Klytaimestra gives women is the same word as we have seen in Mentor’s speech qualifying the harsh (<em>khalepos</em>, O.2.232) king that he takes the Ithacans to deserve for not remembering Odysseus. Therefore, in the polarities between good, ethical conduct and memory on the one hand and bad behavior and incurrence of <em>mēnis</em> on the other, Klytaimestra’s song would fall on the side of the latter, leading to grief and pain. If we compare this picture with that presented by Odysseus in his wishes for a happy marriage to Nausikaa, we can see that this pain aligns with the <em>algea</em>, ‘griefs’, suffered by the enemies of the ideal likeminded couple (O.6.184). In contrast, the good person’s praise poetry in Agamemnon’s exclamation is characterized by <em>kharis</em>: the <em>kleos</em> is an <em>aoidē khariessa</em>, a ‘<em>kharis</em>-filled song’ (O.24.197-198), just as the likemindedness of the couple in Odysseus’ wishes for Nausikaa is the cause of <em>kharmata</em>, ‘source of joy’ (O.24.185), for their well-wishers. And here we have one such well-wisher, Agamemnon, exclaiming on the happiness of Odysseus and Penelope, and even calling their <em>kleos</em> <em>kharis</em>-filled himself. </p><p>See further: </p><p>Nagy, Gregory. 1974. <em>Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter</em>.

Most importantly, he specifies what is <em>themis</em>, right in accordance with the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior, in relationships of <em>kharis</em>: the ample reciprocal exchange of gifts and hospitality (O.24.285). Both of the key terms for reciprocity, in the form of words connected to <em>kharis</em> (<em>χαρίζεο</em>, “gave freely,” O.24.283) and <em>amoibe</em> (<em>ἀμειψάμενος</em>, “having requited,” O.24.285), are present. In addition, the way the <em>themis</em> of relationships of <em>kharis</em> is phrased, with <em>ὅς τις ὑπάρξῃ</em>, “when one has begun,” (O.24.286), implies that the relationship is continuous, with a potentially infinite number or reciprocations. This confirmation the ongoing nature of <em>kharis</em> also supports its connection to memory, which is necessary for sustaining this continuity. This is the kind of reciprocity, Laertes maintains, that Odysseus would have shown. </p><p>Laertes also characterizes the suitors (and by extension, especially given the impreciseness of his words, their solidarity group) as <em>ἀτάσθαλοι ἄνδρες</em>, “wicked men” (O.24.282). This adjective is applied to their behavior elsewhere in the poem, too, and it is the opposite of Odysseus’ conduct according to Penelope (O.4.693). Laertes also characterizes the suitors as <em>ὑβρισταὶ</em>, “men of <em>hubris</em>,” making explicit their status as violators of the rules maintaining the cosmic order (cp. O.24.458 on <em>atasthalia</em>; O.1.368, O.3.206-207, O.4.321, O.4.625-627, O.16.85-86, O.16.410, O.15.328-329 on <em>hubris</em>). The contrast drawn here between the suitors and Odysseus implies that what qualifies the suitors as men of <em>hubris</em> is their failure in matters of <em>kharis</em> in accordance with <em>themis</em>. What Laertes says of the suitors matches what we see in Penelope’s speech at O.4.687-695 (where see my comment). </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.281-24.286","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"themis"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hubristai ‘men of outrage’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Reciprocal exchange"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"kharis"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"atasthaliā ‘recklessness’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"amoibe"}],"authors":[{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252291","title":"Odyssey 24.291","body":"<p>See the comment at O.14.135.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.291","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ikhthuoeis ‘fish-swarming’ as an epithet of pontos ‘crossing [of the sea]’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"man overboard devoured by fish"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252341","title":"Odyssey 24.328-346","body":"<p>Odysseus shows to Laertes his tell-tale scar, O.24.331, after the father asks his son for a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ as proof of identity.

The speech recalls that of Telemakhos’ to the assembly, which forecast the threat of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors and Ithacans (<em>Od</em>. 2.63-69). Instead of the extension of the retributive power of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors’ solidarity group, however, Zeus here proposes to cancel it with the help of divinely inspired total forgetting of the suitors and their killing (ἔκλησιν, <em>Od</em>. 24.485). We can see that <em>lēthē</em> is opposed not only to memory, but also to its flipside <em>mēnis</em>. Furthermore, by comparing Zeus’ speech with that of Mentor’s in the assembly, another way in which it resolves the tensions set up in the poem becomes apparent: just as Mentor says that the Ithacans deserve a harsh ruler for not remembering how kind a ruler Odysseus was (<em>Od</em>. 2.230-234), here Zeus promises that Odysseus will in fact continue to rule, and there will be love between him and his subjects. This outcome, too, depends on the <em>eklēsis</em>, and so we can see that the ills resulting from <em>mēnis</em> and not remembering are both countered by this divine forgetting, further underlining their parallelism.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.482-24.486","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252802","title":"Odyssey 24.482","body":"<p>analysis of the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey (vs. in the Iliad) and the muting of the mēnis theme in it, here especially regarding the suitors, their relatives, and Odysseus and his family</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.482","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252848","title":"Odyssey 24.485","body":"<p>analysis of the differentiation of blame in the Odyssey (vs. in the Iliad) and the muting of the mēnis theme in it, here especially regarding the suitors, their relatives, and Odysseus and his family</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.485","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252914","title":"Odyssey 24.518","body":"<p>analysis of the formulas with the three places where eukhesthai + dative has the shape eukh ˘ ˘ – [=short short long], with this verse showing a process analogous to what we see in I.11.736</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.518","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.252961","title":"Odyssey 24.518","body":"<p>in a list of examples of eukhesthai + dative (formulas which report prayers)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:24.518","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.253010","title":"Odyssey 24.520","body":"<p>Here at O.24.520, Athena ‘breathes’ into Laertes the ‘mental power’ that he needs to be victorious, as expressed respectively by <em>pneîn</em> and <em>menos</em> This situation is the converse of ‘breathing-out [<em>pneîn</em>] mental-power [<em>menos</em>]’, as attested at O.22.203.
