As the smoke that goes up into heaven from\n    some city that is being beleaguered on an island far out at sea - all day long\n    do men sally from the city and fight their hardest, and at the going down of\n    the sun the line of beacon-fires blazes forth, flaring high for those that\n    dwell near them to behold, if so be that they may come with their ships and\n    succor them - even so did the light flare from the head of Achilles, as he\n    stood by the trench, going beyond the wall - but he aid not join the Achaeans\n    for he heeded the charge which his mother laid upon him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"217\" unit=\"line\"/>There did he stand and shout aloud.

The Achaeans to\n    their great joy then drew Patroklos out of reach of the weapons, and laid him\n    on a litter: his comrades stood mourning round him, and among them fleet\n    Achilles who wept bitterly as he saw his true comrade lying dead upon his bier.\n    He had sent him out with horses and chariots into battle, but his return he was\n    not to welcome. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"239\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Hera sent the busy sun, loath though he\n    was, into the waters of Okeanos; so he set, and the Achaeans had rest from the\n    tug and turmoil of war. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"243\" unit=\"line\"/>Now the Trojans when they had come out of the\n    fight, unyoked their horses and gathered in assembly before preparing their\n    supper.

They took their supper throughout the\n    host, and meanwhile through the whole night the Achaeans mourned Patroklos, and\n    the son of Peleus led them in their lament. He laid his murderous hands upon\n    the breast of his comrade, groaning again and again as a bearded lion when a\n    man who was chasing deer has robbed him of his young in some dense forest; when\n    the lion comes back he is furious, and searches dingle and dell to track the\n    hunter if he can find him, for he is mad with rage - even so with many a sigh\n    did Achilles speak among the Myrmidons saying, \"Alas! vain were the words with\n    which I cheered the hero Menoitios in his own house; I said that I would bring\n    his brave son back again to Opoeis after he had sacked <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> and taken his share of the spoils - but\n    Zeus does not give all men their heart's desire.

Say what you want, and I will do it\n    for you at once if I can, and if it can be done at all.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"428\" unit=\"line\"/>Thetis wept and answered, \"Hephaistos, is there\n    another goddess in <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> whom the\n    son of Kronos has been pleased to try with so much affliction as he has me? Me\n    alone of the marine goddesses did he make subject to a mortal husband, Peleus\n    son of Aiakos, and sorely against my will did I submit to the embraces of one\n    who was but mortal, and who now stays at home worn out with age. Neither is\n    this all. Heaven granted me a son, hero among heroes, and he shot up as a\n    sapling. I tended him as a plant in a goodly garden and sent him with his ships\n    to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> to fight the Trojans, but\n    never shall I welcome him back to the house of Peleus. So long as he lives to\n    look upon the light of the sun, he is in heaviness, and though I go to him I\n    cannot help him; King Agamemnon has made him give up the maiden whom the sons\n    of the Achaeans had awarded him, and he wastes with sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] for her sake. Then the Trojans hemmed the\n    Achaeans in at their ships' sterns and would not let them come forth; the\n    elders, therefore, of the Argives besought Achilles and offered him great\n    treasure, whereon he refused to bring deliverance to them himself, but put his\n    own armor on Patroklos and sent him into the fight with many people after him.\n    All day long they fought by the Scaean gates and would have taken the city\n    there and then, had not Apollo granted glory to Hektor and slain the valiant\n    son of Menoitios after he had done the Trojans much evil. Therefore I am\n    suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to provide my son, whose\n    end is near at hand, with helmet and shield, with goodly greaves fitted with\n    ankle-clasps, and with a breastplate, for he lost his own when his true comrade\n    fell at the hands of the Trojans, and he now lies stretched on earth in the\n    bitterness of his soul.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"462\" unit=\"line\"/>And Hephaistos answered, \"Take heart, and be no\n    more disquieted about this matter; would that I could hide him from death's\n    sight when his hour is come, so surely as I can find him armor that shall amaze\n    the eyes of all who behold it.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"468\" unit=\"line\"/>When he had so said he left her and went to his\n    bellows, turning them towards the fire and bidding them do their office. Twenty\n    bellows blew upon the melting-pots, and they blew blasts of every kind, some\n    fierce to help him when he had need of them, and others less strong as\n    Hephaistos willed it in the course of his work. He threw tough copper into the\n    fire, and tin, with silver and gold; he set his great anvil on its block, and\n    with one hand grasped his mighty hammer while he took the tongs in the other. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"478\" unit=\"line\"/>First he shaped the shield so great and strong,\n    adorning it all over and binding it round with a gleaming circuit in three\n    layers; and the baldric was made of silver. He made the shield in five\n    thicknesses, and with many a wonder did his cunning hand enrich it. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"483\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought the earth, the heavens, and the sea;\n    the moon also at her full and the untiring sun, with all the signs that glorify\n    the face of heaven - the Pleiads, the Hyads, huge Orion, and the Bear, which\n    men also call the Wain and which turns round ever in one place, facing. Orion,\n    and alone never dips into the stream of Okeanos. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought also two cities, fair to see and\n    busy with the hum of men. In the one were weddings and wedding-feasts, and they\n    were going about the city with brides whom they were escorting by torchlight\n    from their chambers. Loud rose the cry of Hymen, and the youths danced to the\n    music of flute and lyre, while the women stood each at her house door to see\n    them. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"497"},{"n":"497","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"497\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"497\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile the people were gathered in assembly,\n    for there was a quarrel [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">neikos</term>], and two men were\n    wrangling about the blood-price for a man who had died, the one claiming to the\n    <term xml:lang=\"grc\">d√™mos</term> that he had the right to pay off the\n    damages in full, and the other refusing to accept anything. Each was seeking a\n    limit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">peirar</term>], in the presence of an arbitrator\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hist√¥r</term>], and the people took sides, each man\n    backing the side that he had taken;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"502\" unit=\"line\"/>but the heralds kept them back, and the elders\n    sat on their seats of stone in a solemn circle, holding the staves which the\n    heralds had put into their hands. Then they rose and each in his turn gave\n    judgment [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dik√™</term>], and there were two measures of\n    gold laid down, to be given to him whose judgment [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dik√™</term>] should be deemed the fairest. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"509\" unit=\"line\"/>About the other city there lay encamped two\n    hosts in gleaming armor, and they were divided whether to sack it, or to spare\n    it and accept the half of what it contained. But the men of the city would not\n    yet consent, and armed themselves for a surprise; their wives and little\n    children kept guard upon the walls, and with them were the men who were past\n    fighting through age; but the others sallied forth with Ares and Pallas Athena\n    at their head - both of them wrought in gold and clad in golden raiment, great\n    and fair with their armor as befitting gods, while they that followed were\n    smaller. When they reached the place where they would lay their ambush, it was\n    on a riverbed to which live stock of all kinds would come from far and near to\n    water; here, then, they lay concealed, clad in full armor. Some way off them\n    there were two scouts who were on the look-out for the coming of sheep or\n    cattle, which presently came, followed by two shepherds who were playing on\n    their pipes, and had not so much as a thought of danger. When those who were in\n    ambush saw this, they cut off the flocks and herds and killed the shepherds.\n    Meanwhile the besiegers, when they heard much noise among the cattle as they\n    sat in council, sprang to their horses, and made with all speed towards them;\n    when they reached them they set battle in array by the banks of the river, and\n    the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another. With them were Strife\n    and Riot, and fell Fate who was dragging three men after her, one with a fresh\n    wound, and the other unwounded, while the third was dead, and she was dragging\n    him along by his heel: and her robe was bedrabbled in men's blood. They went in\n    and out with one another and fought as though they were living people haling\n    away one another's dead. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"541\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought also a fair fallow field, large and\n    thrice ploughed already. Many men were working at the plough within it, turning\n    their oxen to and fro, furrow after furrow. Each time that they turned on\n    reaching the headland a man would come up to them and give them a cup of wine,\n    and they would go back to their furrows looking forward to the time when they\n    should again reach the headland. The part that they had ploughed was dark\n    behind them, so that the field, though it was of gold, still looked as if it\n    were being ploughed - very curious to behold. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"550\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought also a field of harvest grain, and\n    the reapers were reaping with sharp sickles in their hands. Swathe after swathe\n    fell to the ground in a straight line behind them, and the binders bound them\n    in bands of twisted straw. There were three binders, and behind them there were\n    boys who gathered the cut grain in armfuls and kept on bringing them to be\n    bound: among them all the owner of the land stood by in silence and was glad.\n    The servants were getting a meal ready under an oak, for they had sacrificed a\n    great ox, and were busy cutting him up, while the women were making a porridge\n    of much white barley for the laborers' dinner. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"561\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought also a vineyard, golden and fair to\n    see, and the vines were loaded with grapes. The bunches overhead were black,\n    but the vines were trained on poles of silver. He ran a ditch of dark metal all\n    round it, and fenced it with a fence of tin; there was only one path to it, and\n    by this the vintagers went when they would gather the vintage. Youths and\n    maidens all blithe and full of glee, carried the luscious fruit in plaited\n    baskets; and with them there went a boy who made sweet music with his lyre, and\n    sang the Linus-song with his clear boyish voice. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"573\" unit=\"line\"/>He wrought also a herd of horned cattle. He\n    made the cows of gold and tin, and they lowed as they came full speed out of\n    the yards to go and feed among the waving reeds that grow by the banks of the\n    river. Along with the cattle there went four shepherds, all of them in gold,\n    and their nine fleet dogs went with them. Two terrible lions had fastened on a\n    bellowing bull that was with the foremost cows, and bellow as he might they\n    haled him, while the dogs and men gave chase: the lions tore through the bull's\n    thick hide and were gorging on his blood and bowels, but the herdsmen were\n    afraid to do anything, and only hounded on their dogs; the dogs dared not\n    fasten on the lions but stood by barking and keeping out of harm's way. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"587\" unit=\"line\"/>The god wrought also a pasture in a fair\n    mountain dell, and large flock of sheep, with a homestead and huts, and\n    sheltered sheepfolds. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"590"},{"n":"590","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"590\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"590\" unit=\"line\"/>Furthermore he wrought a green, like that which\n    Daedalus once made in <placeName key=\"perseus,Knossos\">Knossos</placeName> for\n    lovely Ariadne. Here was a dance [khoros] of youths and maidens, whom all would\n    woo, all with their hands on one another's wrists. The maidens wore robes of\n    light linen, and the youths well woven shirts that were slightly oiled. The\n    girls were crowned with garlands, while the young men had daggers of gold that\n    hung by silver baldrics; sometimes they would dance deftly in a ring with merry\n    twinkling feet, as it were a potter sitting at his work and making trial of his\n    wheel to see whether it will run, and sometimes they would go all in line with\n    one another, and many people was gathered joyously about the place of dancing\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">khoros</term>]. There was a bard also to sing to them\n    and play his lyre, while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of\n    them when the man struck up with his tune. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"607\" unit=\"line\"/>All round the outermost rim of the shield he\n    set the mighty stream of the river Okeanos. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"609\" unit=\"line\"/>Then when he had fashioned the shield so great\n    and strong, he made a breastplate also that shone brighter than fire. He made\n    helmet, close fitting to the brow, and richly worked, with a golden plume\n    overhanging it; and he made greaves also of beaten tin. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"614\" unit=\"line\"/>Lastly, when the famed lame god had made all\n    the armor, he took it and set it before the mother of Achilles; whereon she\n    darted like a falcon from the snowy summits of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> and bore away the gleaming armor from the house of\n    Hephaistos. <milestone n=\"617\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
