As soon as he had tasted the blood he knew me, and weeping bitterly\n    stretched out his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor\n    substance any more, and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. ‘How did you\n    come by your death,’ said I, ‘King Agamemnon? Did Poseidon raise his winds and\n    waves against you when you were at sea, or did your enemies make an end of you\n    on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or sheep-stealing, or while they\n    were fighting in defense of their wives and city?’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"404\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Odysseus,’ he answered, ‘noble son of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, I was not lost at sea\n    in any storm of Poseidon's raising, nor did my foes dispatch me upon the\n    mainland, but Aigisthos and my wicked wife were the death of me between them.\n    He asked me to his house, feasted me, and then butchered me most miserably as\n    though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house, while all around me my comrades\n    were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding breakfast, or dinner-party, or\n    gourmet feast of some great nobleman. You must have seen numbers of men killed\n    either in a general engagement, or in single combat, but you never saw anything\n    so truly pitiable as the way in which we fell in that room, with the\n    mixing-bowl and the loaded tables lying all about, and the ground reeking with\n    our blood. I heard Priam's daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her\n    close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body, and\n    raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess, but she slipped away from me;\n    she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was dying, for there is\n    nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as a woman when she has fallen\n    into such guilt as hers was. Fancy murdering her own husband! I thought I was\n    going to be welcomed home by my children and my servants, but her abominable\n    crime has brought disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after - even\n    on the good ones.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"435"},{"n":"435","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"435\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>\"And I said, ‘In truth Zeus has hated the house\n    of Atreus from first to last in the matter of their women's counsels.

Do not tell her all that you\n    know perfectly well yourself. Tell her a part only, and keep your own counsel\n    about the rest. Not that your wife, Odysseus, is likely to murder you, for\n    Penelope is a very admirable woman, and has an excellent nature. We left her a\n    young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>.

The <term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê </term>of the fleet descendant of Aiakos knew me and\n    spoke piteously, saying, ‘Odysseus, noble son of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, what deed of daring will you\n    undertake next, that you venture down to the house of Hades among us silly\n    dead, who are but the ghosts of them that can labor no more?’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"477"},{"n":"477","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"477\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"477\" unit=\"line\"/>\"And I said, ‘Achilles, son of Peleus, foremost\n    champion of the Achaeans, I came to consult Teiresias, and see if he could\n    advise me about my return home to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, for I have never yet been able to get near the Achaean\n    land, nor to set foot in my own country, but have been in trouble all the time.\n    As for you, Achilles, no one was ever yet so fortunate as you have been, nor\n    ever will be, for you were adored by all us Argives as long as you were alive,\n    and now that you are here you are a great prince among the dead.

In our councils of\n    war before <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> he was always first\n    to speak, and his judgment was unerring.

Many a\n    man did he kill in battle - I cannot name every single one of those whom he\n    slew while fighting on the side of the Argives, but will only say how he killed\n    that valiant hero Eurypylos son of Telephus, who was the handsomest man I ever\n    saw except Memnon; many others also of the Ceteians fell around him by reason\n    of a woman's bribes. Moreover, when all the bravest of the Argives went inside\n    the horse that Epeios had made, and it was left to me to settle when we should\n    either open the door of our ambuscade, or close it, though all the other\n    leaders and chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in\n    every limb, I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he\n    was all the time urging me to break out from the horse - grasping the handle of\n    his sword and his bronze-shod spear, and breathing fury against the foe. Yet\n    when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his handsome share of the prize\n    wealth and went on board (such is the fortune of war) without a wound upon him,\n    neither from a thrown spear nor in close combat, for the rage of Ares is a\n    matter of great chance.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"538\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When I had told him this, the ghost [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of Achilles strode off across a meadow full of\n    asphodel, exulting over what I had said concerning the prowess of his son.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"541"},{"n":"541","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"541\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"541\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The ghosts [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhai</term>] of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own\n    melancholy tale; but the <term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term> of Ajax son of\n    Telamon alone held aloof - still angry with me for having won the cause in our\n    dispute about the armor of Achilles.

The\n    man who made that belt, do what he might, would never be able to make another\n    like it.

On this I hastened\n    back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at once and loose the\n    hawsers; so they embarked and took their places, whereon the ship went down the\n    stream of the river Okeanos.
