They wanted to tear him in pieces and\n    eat up everything he had, but Odysseus stayed their hands although they were\n    infuriated, and now you devour his property without paying for it, and break my\n    heart by wooing his wife and trying to kill his son.

I say - and it shall surely be - that my spear shall be reddened with\n    his blood; for many a time has Odysseus taken me on his knees, held wine up to\n    my lips to drink, and put pieces of meat into my hands. Therefore Telemakhos is\n    much the dearest friend I have, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us\n    suitors.
