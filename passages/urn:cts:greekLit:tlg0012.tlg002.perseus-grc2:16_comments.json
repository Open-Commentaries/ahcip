[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.010085","title":"Odyssey 16.418-433","body":"<p>  </p><p>In this passage Penelope appeals to Antinoos in a way that follows the model of the invocational theme. It refers to memory in order to elicit the desirable action, and the usual phrase for it is <em>ἦ οὐ μέμνῃ</em>, “or do you not remember” (e.g. O.24.115). Here, however, we have a variation on the formulaic phrase, as Penelope says <em>ἦ</em> <em>οὐκ</em> <em>οἶσθ&#x27;</em>, “or do you not know,” to introduce a reminiscence on how Odysseus protected Antinoos’ father from the angry people. Penelope’s appeal corresponds to the invocational theme in also including a command: <em>σε παύεσθαι κέλομαι</em>, “I order you to stop” (O.16.433; compare the invocational theme at O.24.114). Furthermore, Penelope introduces a past favor to remember – an appeal to the rules of reciprocity. She has chosen a particularly relevant example, one that allows to draw clear parallels between the situation of Antinoos’ father in the past and what the son himself is doing in the present. Just as the people wanted to kill his father, so now the suitors, with Antinoos spearheading the plans, are plotting to kill Telemakhos (O.4.660-672, and again at O.16.363-392). And just as the people also wanted to eat up Antinoos’ father’s livelihood, so the suitors are eating up that of Odysseus (or Telemakhos) – correspondences that Penelope herself points out specifically (O.16.431-432). What is more, Penelope refers to a social institution that entails bonds of obligation, which has been established between Odysseus and Antinoos’ father: <em>hiketeia</em>, ‘supplication’, or the relationship between the suppliant and the supplicated created through the ritual (cp. <em>xenia</em>, ‘guest-friendship’) – and these bonds are hereditary. Here Penelope reminds Antinoos of the very institution itself by using a specific term, <em>ἱκέτας</em>, “suppliants,” (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.422; also <em>ἵκετο</em>, “[Antinoos’ father] came [as a suppliant],” O.16.424) to indicate it, and spells out both the origin of this special relationship between his family and that of Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.424-430), and how Antinoos is breaking it in the current situation (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.421-22, 431-32). </p><p>It should not, then, take much <em>noos</em>, ‘understanding’, ‘intelligence’, ‘mind’, to get the message, but does Anti-<em>noos</em> get it? He does not get a chance to respond as Eurymakhos takes over, assuring Penelope Telemakhos has nothing to fear – while plotting his demise (O.16.419-448). But neither of the two suitors give an indication that Penelope’s speech has the desirable effect, as Eurymakhos’ immediate response and Antinoos’ subsequent behaviour show. He instead proves to be worthy of his name, ‘Counter-<em>noos</em>.’ It is this faculty, <em>noos</em>, which is needed in good working order to avoid transgressing the rules of social and cosmic order, and the lack of which is associated with incurring <em>mēnis</em>, the sanction guaranteeing the maintenance of this order. Memory, in a role complementing that of <em>mēnis</em>, also upholds this order and these rules, and does so by keeping one mindful, in the right way, of the proper course of action. In addition to containing a variation on the invocational theme’s formulaic phrase appealing to memory, then, Penelope’s speech diverges from it also in not eliciting the morally desirable action.  </p><p>See further: </p><p>Gould, John. 1973. “ΗΙΚΕΤΕΙΑ.” <em>The Journal of Hellenic Studies</em> 93:74-103. </p><p>Moran, William Stephen. 1975. “Μιμνήσκομαι and ‘Remembering’ Epic Stories in Homer and the Hymns.” <em>Quaderni Urbinati di cultura classica</em> 20:195-211.</p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

His dear son [= Telemachus] marveled at him, |179 and, in his amazement, he [= Telemachus] cast his gaze away from him, in another direction, fearing that he [= Odysseus] might be a god. |180 And he [= Telemachus] addressed him [= Odysseus], speaking winged words: |181 “As a different kind of person [<em>alloio</em>-], stranger, have you appeared [<em>phainesthai</em>] to me just now, different than before. |182 You have different clothes and your complexion is no longer the same kind [<em>homoio</em>-]. |183 You must be some god, one of those gods who hold the wide sky. |184 So be gracious, in order that we may give you pleasing sacrifices |185 and golden gifts of good workmanship. Have mercy on us.” |186 And he [= Telemachus] was answered then by the one who suffered many things, the radiant Odysseus: |187 “I am not some god. Why do you liken [<em>eïskein</em>] me to the immortals? |188 But I am your father, for whom you mourn and |189 suffer many pains, enduring the violent acts of men.” |190 Having said these things, he kissed his son and let fall from his cheeks |191 a tear, letting it fall to the ground. Until then he had persisted in showing no sign of pity. |192 And Telemachus, since he was not yet convinced that he [= Odysseus] was his father, |193 once again addressed him with words in reply: |194 “You are not Odysseus my father. Instead, some superhuman force |195 is enchanting me, and it makes me weep and mourn even more. |196 I say this because no mortal man could craft these things that are happening to me, |197 no mortal could do these things by way of his own devising, unless a god comes in person |198 and, if he so wishes, easily makes someone a young man or makes him an old man. |199 Why, just a little while ago you were an old man wearing unseemly clothes, |200 but now you look like [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] the gods who hold the wide sky.” |201 He was answered by Odysseus, the one with many kinds of craft, who addressed him thus: |202 “Telemachus, it does not seem right [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] for you to be amazed at your father who is right here inside [the shelter], |203 for you to be amazed too much or to feel overwhelmed. |204 There will never again be some different [<em>allos</em>] person who comes here, some different Odysseus, |205 but here I am such [<em>toiosde</em>] as I am. I have had many bad things happen to me. I have been detoured in many different ways. |206 But now I am here, having come back in the twentieth year to the land of my ancestors. |207 I tell you, this was the work of Athena, the giver of prizes, |208 who has made me be such [toios] as she wants me to be, for she has the power. |209 One moment, she has made me to be looking like [enalinkios] a beggar, and then, the next moment, |210 like a young man who has beautiful clothes covering his complexion. |211 It is easy for the gods, who hold the wide sky, |212 to make a mortal man become exalted with radiance or to debase him.</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from MoM 2§§18–20.) As soon as Odysseus has been stroked by the wand of Athena, his outward appearance—his <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’—is no longer the same as it had been before, O.16.182. That is what Telemachus is saying to Odysseus. The son is amazed that the father no longer looks like an old beggar. The word used here to express the idea of sameness is <em>homoio</em>- ‘similar to, same as’, O.16.182. This word <em>homoio</em>-, derived from <em>homó</em>-, further derives from the Indo-European form *<em>somo</em>- meaning ‘same’. In fact, the English word same is cognate with the Greek word <em>homó</em>--. See the anchor comment at I.05.441. Because the complexion of Odysseus is no longer the same, he no longer looks the same. Now he looks different. He is now a different kind of person. In the wording of O.16.181, Odysseus the person is now <em>alloio</em>- ‘a different kind’. This word <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is the opposite of <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’. I note that the extension ‑<em>io</em>- (‑ιο-) of the adjectives homoio- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’ and <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is parallel to the extension ‑<em>io</em>- (‑ιο-) of the adjectives <em>hoio</em>- (oἷο-) ‘what kind’ and <em>toio</em>- (τοῖο-) ‘that kind’. At O.16.205 and O.16.208 in the passage I have just quoted and translated, we also see this meaning of <em>toio</em>- ‘that kind’ in action. In this same passage, it is said that Odysseus looks like an old man or looks like a young man, whatever a divinity may wish, O.16.198. But when he looks like a young man for Telemachus to see, his son needs to avert his eyes because he sees what he now sees, O.16.179. What he now sees is that <em>Odysseus at that moment looks not only like a young man but also like a divinity</em>. Relevant is the question that Odysseus asks his son at O.16.187: ‘Why do you liken [<em>eïskein</em>] me to the immortals?’... In answer to this question, Telemachus can rightly say at O.16.200: ‘but now you look like [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] the gods who hold the wide sky’. And, in terms of the ritual transformation of Odysseus by way of a sacred contact with the wand of the goddess Athena herself, this mortal not only looks like one of the gods but he actually becomes a god in the ritual moment marked by the similes that liken him to the god. So, the contexts of <em>eïskein</em> ‘make likenesses, liken’ at O.16.187 and O.16.200 show that Telemachus was justified in saying that Odysseus looks the same as a god after being touched by the wand of Athena. Similarly at O.03.464–468, there is a ritual transformation of Telemachus when he is bathed in a bathtub called an <em>asaminthos</em>, O.03.468. As I note in the comment on O.03.464–468, here is what happens at O.03.468 to Telemachus as a result of this ritual bath: ‘he [= Telemachus] emerged from the bathtub [<em>asaminthos</em>], looking the same as [<em>homoio</em>-] the immortals in shape’ (ἔκ ῥ’ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος). </p><p>In the light of this analysis, I offer a general formulation: for a mortal to appear like an immortal to other mortals is to become a divinity in a ritual moment of epiphany—as marked by the similes that make mortals equal to divinities in that ritual moment.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:16.172-16.212","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"eïskein ‘make likenesses, liken’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"homoio- 'similar to, same as'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"asaminthos 'bathtub'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.234968","title":"Odyssey 16.214","body":"<p>The image of ‘pouring all over’ someone whom you are embracing, as expressed here by way of the verb <em>amphi-khu-</em>, extends from the idea of <em>dissolving in tears</em>: when you are weeping, pouring out your tears from your eyes, it is as if your whole self were dissoving into tears, which can then ‘pour all over’ that beloved someone whom you are embracing.

That is because he shows no gratitude for the kindness that Odysseus as king had shown to Eupeithes, the father of Antinoos, back when Eupeithes was a refugee seeking the favor of Odysseus the king. In the story as told all too briefly by Penelope, O.16.424–429, this man Eupeithes had once sought refuge at the palace of Odysseus, asking the king to protect his food-supply, which was about to be expropriated, O.16.429. The threat of expropriation came from the <em>dēmos</em> ‘community’, described here as being very angry at Eupeithes, O.16.425. But Odysseus had intervened and prevented the expropriation, O.16.430. That is why it is now all the more outrageous, says Penelope at O.16.431, that the son of the same man whose livelihood had thus been saved by a beneficent king should now turn right around and expropriate the livelihood of his family’s benefactor, since Antinoos and the other suitors are now consuming the livelihood of Odysseus, depleting the resources of that generous king. That is bad enough, says Penelope, but Antinoos goes even further, much further: this ingrate also makes advances at the king’s wife and even plots the murder of the king’s son, O.16.431–432.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:16.418-16.432","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"reciprocity"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Antinoos as the ultimate ingrate"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dēmos ‘community, district’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.235266","title":"Odyssey 16.446","body":"<p>in the discussion of the rationale of the classification of the attestations of eukhesthai + dative</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:16.446","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.235312","title":"Odyssey 16.777-16.780","body":"<p>comparison to Od.

His better qualities are further brought out in this passage by mentioning that he pleases Penelope the most with words (<em>μύθοισι</em>; O.16.397-398) and that he thinks well (<em>ἐῢ φρονέων</em>, O.16.399), in both cases vocabulary we can see elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>to connect with a good mind and memory. The same formulaic phrase <em>φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ&#x27; ἀγαθῇσιν</em>, “for he had good <em>phrenes</em>,” is used of Eumaios and his unforgetful, unfailing observance of the gods (O.14.420-421): the formula indicates the connection between good memory, good <em>phrenes</em>, and respect of the cosmic order. Sharing this formulaic description with Odysseus’ exemplarily upright swineherd, Amphinomos appears to be of this more mindful sort, too. This characterisation is furthermore supported by Amphinomos’ deference to the gods’ will (O.16.402-403). Elsewhere, his exceptionality among the suitors is brought out in his treatment of Odysseus disguised as a beggar (O.18.122-123): he is deferential and kind when all others insult Odysseus.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc2:16.397@φρεσὶ-16.397@ἀγαθῇσιν·","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Anita Nikkanen","email":"nikkanen@fas.harvard.edu","username":"anikkanen"}]}]
