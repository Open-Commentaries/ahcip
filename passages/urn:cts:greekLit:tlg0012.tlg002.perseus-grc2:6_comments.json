I spell her name in its familiar latinized form, with a <em>c</em>, since her fame extends far beyond the ancient Greek world, where she appears as Ναυσικάα. In any case, the name has a certain primacy of place. I have no idea who said it first, but I first heard it from the long-departed Sterling Dow in the early 1960s: if you look up all surviving ancient Greek names in reverse alphabetical order, the first one you see is Nausicaa = Ναυσικάα, while the very last of them all is Calypso = Καλυψώ. Surely we see here a coincidence, not some mysterious signal emanating from some grand cosmic plan, but the coincidence itself seems just as lovely as Nausicaa is lovely. Some critics view her as a youthful love-interest for Odysseus, matching Calypso as the hero’s divine love-interest. But such a view detracts from the loveliness: Nausicaa is meant to be a love-interest for all who hear her story—just as Calypso is a universal love-interest in her own story as told in Rhapsody 5. In the story of Nausicaa as told in Rhapsody 6, she is pictured as the perfect bride for any man fortunate enough to succeed in marrying her—and she knows it. The self-awareness of Nausicaa is shaped by the poetry that idealizes her eligibility by animating her beauty and her charm to the point where she becomes comparable to the goddess Artemis. Odysseus himself initiates the comparison and, by comparing the girl to the goddess, he is signaling to himself that Nausicaa, even if she does not know it yet, is for him enticingly unattainable.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:6.1-6.331","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.205032","title":"Odyssey 6.1-2","body":"<p>The wording that starts Rhapsody 6 here at O.06.001–112 picks up where the wording of Rhapsody 5 left off, at O.05.491–493, where Odysseus had fallen asleep after his ordeals at sea. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:6.1-6.2","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"rhapsodic sequencing"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.205099","title":"Odyssey 6.5-6","body":"<p>The Cyclopes, when they were neighboring enemies of the Phaeacians, O.06.005, are said to have been superior because of their <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’, O.06.006. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:6.5-6.6","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Cyclopes"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.205149","title":"Odyssey 6.15-6.17","body":"<p>Nausicaa, daughter of Alkinoos (latinized as Alcinous), is named here for the first time, O.06.017.

Next, at O.06.100–101, after having finished eating and drinking, they start playfully singing and dancing with each other: the playfulness of the song and dance is expressed by the verb <em>paizein</em> ‘play’ at O.06.100, while the actual singing /dancing is expressed by the noun <em>molpē</em> ‘singing and dancing’ at O.06.101. The prima donna / prima ballerina of the singing / dancing is Nausicaa herself, as expressed by the verb <em>arkhesthai </em>‘lead off [in performing]’, again at O.06.101. The dancing in this case includes the playful tossing of a <em>sphaira</em> ‘ball’, O.06.100. While the girls are feeling all freed up in their playfulness, they throw off the <em>krēdemna</em> or ‘veils’ that they are wearing. So, now we can see that Nausicaa and the girls who attend her would not even think of going out in public without first putting on their <em>krēdemna</em> ‘veils’. They won’t leave home without wearing their headdresses. But now they are no longer in public—or so they imagine. The detail about wearing a veil when the girls leave home and go outdoors is hardly a signal of their being married. Clearly, all these girls are unmarried. So, we see here that unmarried women as well as married women like Andromache wear the <em>krēdemnon </em>in public. The custom is simply a signal of propriety. On the function of the <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’ as an equivalent of a ‘veil’, I recommend the work of Levine 1995 (especially pp. 96–110), who shows that the custom of wearing a veil is part of a “cultural grammar of hair” (Levine p. 95). Relevant are my comments about O.05.333–353 with reference to Ino the White Goddess and, earlier, about I.22.460–474 with reference to Andromache. In both sets of comments, I noted that the undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I called an <em>Aphrodisiac effect</em>. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon </em>is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. But there is even more to it. When a woman or girl is indoors instead of outdoors, in public, then, while indoors, the sexuality is under control—so long as the vision of the woman or girl with hair undone is private. But what happens when the undoing of the hair is represented in the verbal arts or visual arts? Then the view becomes public and even voyeuristic.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/430082001_1280.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Red-figured pyxis, picturing Nereids at home, “indoors”: the Nereid with her hair down is labeled as Thaleia.<br/><u><a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=195427001&amp;objectId=400084&amp;partId=1\">Image</a></u> via The British Museum.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, there is something voyeuristic about the representation of Nausicaa and the girls who attend her as they sing and dance without wearing their veils: they imagine they are in a private place, but the medium of verbal art is watching them, making their performance public.
