Then, by way of synecdoche, the specific idea of <em>distribution</em> extends metonymically to the general idea of <em>feasting</em> and further to the even more general idea of a <em>festival</em>. Following the logic of this sequence of meanings, we see that the animal sacrifice at O.08.059 had led to the cooking and the distribution of the meat, O.08.061, which will lead to communal dining, O.08.071–072, which will lead to the First Song of Demodokos, O.08.073–083, and so on. On <em>metonymy</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. In terms of this logic, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> in the sense of ‘feast’ here at O.08.061 marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals: animal sacrifice, communal feasting, singing as well as dancing at the feast. As we will see in comments that follow, this <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ as signaled at O.08.061 will be rethought as a stylized festival, centering on a sacrifice that leads to a division of meat at the feast.

(See also PP 63, HC 2§92n.) The paraphrasing here of the song of Demodokos recapitulates the <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium, prelude’ of the song. [What follows is epitomized from HC 2§§92–93:] In the case of the compound noun <em>prooimion</em> / προοίμιον, conventionally translated as ‘proemium’, the element -<em>oim</em>- / -οιμ- is derived from a root that we find also attested in two simple nouns, <em>oimos</em> / οἶμος and <em>oimē</em> / οἰμή. The Attic by-form of <em>prooimion</em> / προοίμιον, which is <em>phroimion</em> / φροίμιον, elucidates the prehistory of the root: we must reconstruct it not as *<em>oim</em>- but as *<em>hoim</em>-, from *<em>soim</em>-. This reconstruction helps elucidate the surviving contexts of both <em>oimos</em> / οἶμος and <em>oimē</em> / οἰμή, which do not always give a clear picture of the basic meaning of either form. In some contexts, the meaning seems to be ‘song’, as here at O.08.074, while in others it seems to be ‘way, pathway’, as in Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 290. With the help of comparative evidence, however, the primary meaning of <em>oimos</em> and <em>oimē</em> can be reconstructed as ‘thread, threading’, and the meanings ‘song’ or ‘way, pathway’ can be explained as secondary: that is, ‘song’ and ‘way, pathway’ are metaphorical generalizations derived from the meaning ‘thread, threading’ (PR 72, 81; also PP 63n20). And it is such a primary meaning ‘thread, threading’ that we find in comparable forms attested in other Indo-European languages: for example, the form *<em>soimos</em> that we reconstruct from Greek <em>oimos</em> is attested as Old Icelandic <em>seimr</em>, meaning ‘thread’ (for this and other examples, see Durante 1976:176). In terms of such a primary meaning, the etymology of the compound noun <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium’ can be interpreted as a metaphor referring to the ‘initial threading’ of a song. A close semantic parallel to the etymology of Greek <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium’ as an ‘initial threading’ of a song is the etymology of Latin <em>exordium</em>, which likewise means ‘proemium’ in poetic and rhetorical contexts: the meaning of this noun as well can be traced back to the basic idea of an ‘initial threading’ (PP 63n20). The poetic and rhetorical concepts of both Greek <em>prooimion</em> and Latin <em>exordium</em> in the sense of ‘proemium’ have a common Indo-European ancestry. As I will argue later, not only <em>oimos</em> / <em>oimē</em> / <em>prooimion</em> but also <em>humnos</em>, ordinarily translated as ‘hymn’, are derived from roots that refer to the making of fabric. Moreover, I note that the word <em>oimos</em> is formulaically interchangeable with the word <em>humnos</em> at verse 451 of the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (4) <em>to Hermes</em>, where we see the attestation of both οἶμος ἀοιδῆς and ὕμνος ἀοιδῆς in the manuscript tradition; at a later point, we will also consider the cognate expression ἀοιδῆς ὕμνον at verse 429 of <em>Odyssey</em> 8. I interpret the combinations of <em>humnos</em> and <em>oimos</em> with <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ to mean respectively the ‘weaving’ of song and the ‘threading’ of song. Relevant to this interpretation is the context of <em>oimē</em> at verse 74 of <em>Odyssey</em> 8: we see here a metaphorical reference to the initial part of performing a song, that is, to the ‘initial threading’ of a song. To sum up, the meaning of <em>oimos</em> or <em>oimē</em> as ‘song’ results from a metaphorical extension: the idea of <em>making song</em> is being expressed metaphorically through the idea of <em>making fabric</em>. As for contexts where <em>oimos</em> and <em>oimē</em> seem to mean ‘way, pathway’, I argue that such a meaning is likewise a result of metaphorical extension: here the general idea of <em>moving ahead</em> from one point to another is being expressed metaphorically by applying the specific idea of <em>threading one’s way</em> from one point to another (more on this point at HC 2§311, in the excursus there). On points of comparison with the proemium that introduces the <em>History</em> of Herodotus, see PH 221.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:8.74","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"prooimion ‘proemium, prelude’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"oimē ‘thread, story-thread’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.209004","title":"Odyssey 8.75-78","body":"<p>The narrative subject of the epic that is being paraphrased here is a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ between Odysseus and Achilles, O.08.075. And the setting for this quarrel is a <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ that is explicitly correlated with a ‘sacrifice’, O.08.076: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a celebratory feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. The same epithet <em>thaleiēi</em> (θαλείῃ) is also used to describe the ongoing <em>dais </em>‘feast’ at O.08.099. This epithet is of special interest in light of the meaning of the noun <em>thaliai</em> in the plural, ‘celebrations, festivities’, as at O.11.603 (HPC 85n13). We may compare another feast, described at I.08.228–235, where the describer is Agamemnon, recalling a scene from the collective past of the Achaeans: the setting of this other feast was the island of Lemnos, and each one of the Achaean leaders took turns in boasting that he was the best Achaean of them all, I.08.229. In my comment on I.08.228–235, I noted that the noun <em>eukhōlai</em> ‘boastings’ in the plural at I.08.229 indicates a distributive action: the Achaeans were boasting not as a group but individually and competitively. The competitive boasting evidently centered on the question: who would be superior to all others in performing heroic exploits in the upcoming Trojan War? And the setting for this quarrel was a feast where the meat of oxen to be eaten in vast quantities was being apportioned among the Achaean leaders, I.08.231. Since the narrative here makes a point of adding that these leaders were also drinking wine, I.08.232, it is implied that all the boasting could get out of hand and lead to quarrels about the awarding of prime cuts of meat. It would have been expected that the best portion of meat should go to the best hero. On the idea of a champion’s portion of meat, see the comment on I.07.319–322. Having reconstructed for I.08.228–235 a scene of quarreling in the context of apportioning cuts of meat, I return to the scene at O.08.075–078, where we see once again a scene of quarreling in the context of apportioning cuts of meat. And here the ‘quarreling’ is explicitly called a <em>neikos</em>, O.08.075, while the ‘apportioning of meat’ is explicitly called a <em>dais</em>, O.08.076. As we saw in the comment for I.01.423–425, a <em>dais</em> is a feast where meat is distributed, and this meat comes from the sacrifice of sacrificial animals. Thus the act of sacrifice converts the feast of humans into a notional feast of the gods. This notion, ‘feast of the gods’, is made explicit at O.08.076, where the setting is described explicitly this way, as we have already seen: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a celebratory feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. In this festive setting, as I already highlighted in the comment on I.08.228–235, the <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075 is between Odysseus and Achilles, who are described at O.08.078 as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. In terms of such a dispute in the context of a feast, each one of the two heroes would be claiming to be the ‘best of the Achaeans’. Achilles would have claimed to be ‘best’ because of his superior <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’, while Odysseus would have counter-claimed to be ‘best’ because of his superior <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’. See the comments on O.01.002; see also, further back, the comments on I.01.001–012, where I argue that the quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles came from an epic tradition that was independent from the epic tradition that featured the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles. Further, see the comment on I.09.346–352, where I note that this Iliadic passage was thought by Aristarchus (scholia A for I.09.347) to be an allusion to the quarrel at O.08.075–078 between Achilles and Odysseus over one overriding question: will Troy be conquered by relying on the physical power of Achilles or on the mental power of Odysseus? </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:8.75-8.78","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikos 'quarrel'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dais 'feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"'best of the Achaeans'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"mētis ‘mind, intelligence’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.209068","title":"Odyssey 8.79-8.81","body":"<p>In the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, Apollo at Delphi is mentioned only at Ι.09.404–405 and here at O.08.079–081.

The difference is that Hesiod names the context—kings—whereas Odysseus does not, but the reason for this is clear: for Odysseus to do so would require him to identify himself before his dramatic self-disclosure in Book 9. Once the reason for Odysseus’s silence, namely his still hidden identity, is taken into account, the context of the two passages is the same, namely fair speech as the essential quality of a king.</p><p>The close correspondence in phrasing between the two passages has raised the question whether one passage imitates the other, but no consensus has ever been reached. The answer seems to lie not in the imitation of one poet by the other, but in a common poetic tradition behind both poets. This tradition has been identified in a perceptive study by Richard Martin as “the instruction of princes,” a wide-spread genre with important examples in Greek, from Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days</em> and the poetry of Theognis, to the lost <em>Instructions of Chiron</em>. The Hesiodic passage fills in for us what is deliberately withheld in Odysseus’s speech, namely that <em>he is speaking about what it is to be a king.</em> The Homeric audience would have understood this, because they, like us, knew that the speaker is not only a king, but, in the Homeric scheme of things, the ideal king. </p><p>This is only half the story, however. When Odysseus delivers his piece of princely instruction, he does more than hint at his own identity. He also brings the Homeric audience into the story through a more subtle case of hidden identity than his own. In spite of surface appearances the intended recipient of Odysseus’s instruction is not in fact the young Phaeacian to whom it is overtly addressed: his name, Euryalos, which relates to the sea, does not distinguish him from the other Phaeacians, twenty-one of whom have similar sea-related names. That name is generic, a reflection of the Phaeacians’ mythic function as sea-farers. Odysseus does indeed reprove Euryalos at the start of his speech, saying “you are like a reckless man,” and again at the end, where he acknowledges Euryalos’s fine physical appearance, but censures his lack of understanding (<em>noos</em>). However, the burden of Odysseus’s speech is not this reproof, but a positive portrayal of fair speech and its salutary effects.</p><p>The figure who stands most to benefit from this positive instruction is not Euryalos, but the future king of the Phaeacians, who is part of the whole episode from the start. It is Laodamas, the favorite son and heir apparent of king Alcinous, who first sets the episode in motion by inviting—indeed challenging—Odysseus to participate in contests (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.131-151), an invitation which Odysseus turns down with some asperity (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.152-157). This occasions Euryalos’s ill-considered words to Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.158-164) and Odysseus’s response. But if Laodamas is the intended recipient of Odysseus’s instruction, why is he not presented as such, but instead kept far enough from the hero’s display of mettle to escape notice entirely? Odysseus himself provides one answer after his mighty rock toss, when he challenges all the Phaeacian youths to compete with him in further contests but excepts Laodamas from his challenge: only a fool would compete with his host, and Odysseus will not do that(Odyssey 8.204-208). This prudent respect for a host can be seen as present in the prior situation as well, in which Euryalos draws a reproof that all but touches Laodamas, but does not in fact touch him.</p><p>Now Laodamas' name, which means “he who controls the people,” is well suited to a future king, but that is not its real significance, or not all of it. The last Neleid king of Miletus had this name—<em>Leōdamas</em> in its Ionic form—and, while dates are uncertain, this Leōdamas can easily be placed in the Homeric era. Leōdamas is a good candidate to have been the prime mover of Panionian unity in the late eighth and early seventh century BC. We are fortunate indeed to know something of this Leoōamas beyond his name. His memory has been preserved in fragments of two historians of the Roman era. Leōdamas was successful in a foreign war which benefited Miletus and confirmed him as king, and as king he went on to become much loved by his people. His story ended tragically when he was murdered by a rival for the kingship, and this brought kingship itself to an end in Miletus.</p><p>Now the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor traced their pre-migration origins back to the Bronze Age city of Pylos and its legendary founder, king Neleus. More precisely, the royal family of the Ionian city of Miletus traced their origins back to king Neleus, and they were therefore called <em>Neleidai</em>, “descendants of Neleus.” These Neleids then extended their pedigree to other Ionian cities in the process of forming a greater Ionian community, the so-called Ionian dodecapolis. This union of twelve cities, meeting at its cult center Panionion, gave rise to the two Homeric epics as part of the process of Ionian community formation. It is this Ionian community, as it met at Panionion, that the Phaeacians represent.</p><p>In Homer it is not Neleus himself but his son Nestor who plays a great role. It is he who represents the earliest stage in the picture of a common Panionian origin. Alcinous, the Phaeacian king, is a second Nestor, a conscious duplication of the Pylian king. Athena reveals this when she disguises herself as a maiden and meets Odysseus on his way to the Phaeacian palace (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.19-81) . She tells Odysseus about the king and queen he is about to meet inside the palace, and for the king she gives a genealogy extending over four generations, which is in effect Nestor’s genealogy: the names are different but the genealogy’s intricate structure is the same. By her action Athena also identifies the queen, Arete, as a second stage in the picture of a common Panionian origin when she leaves Odysseus and flies to Athens and enters the royal palace, her place of worship. The Neleids were said to have migrated from Pylos to Athens at the end of the Bronze Age, where they became the ruling family; Arete, who is cast in the mold of the Athenian city-goddess, Athena Polias, represents this second stage. It was from Athens that the Neleids next founded Miletus and became its ruling family: the founder of Miletus was named Neleus like his Pylian ancestor, and this gave the Neleid kings of Miletus two ancestors to explain their name.</p><p>When Odysseus gives princely instruction in Book 8 of the <em>Odyssey</em>, identifying fair speech as the essential quality of a king, the instruction is really addressed not to his apparent interlocutor, a misbehaved youth, but to a future king who stands by unnoticed. This future king in turn represents an actual king, ruling in the Homeric present. The Phaeacian Laodamas has as yet done nothing to distinguish himself except behave properly to a stranger. He is all future potential. That potential, we are meant to understand, has now been fulfilled in the actual present. The king who rules now is fictively pictured as having been present to hear the ideal king discourse on what it is to be a king. He has heard the lesson of the past—the heroic past—from the very hero of the poem. The Homeric audience is equally honored in this because like their king they also are like the Phaeacians, since they are also listeners to Odysseus' discourse, and as such they also have received the lessons of the heroic past from the hero’s own mouth. </p><p>Bibliographical references</p><p>Douglas Frame, \"New Light on the Homeric Question: the Phaeacians Unmasked,” <a href=\"http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4453\">http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4453</a>.  For more details on the argument excerpted above, see this article.</p><p>Douglas Frame, \"Odysseus and Kingship: Commentary on <em>Odyssey</em> 8.166-177,\" Classical Inquiries, June 3, 2016, <a href=\"http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/odysseus-and-kingship-commentary-on-odyssey-8-166-177\">http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/odysseus-and-kingship-commentary-on-odyssey-8-166-177</a>.

And he [= Demodokos], getting set up for his point of departure [<em>hormētheis</em>], started [<em>arkhesthai</em>] from the god [<em>theos</em>]. And he made visible the song, |500 taking it from the point where they [= the Achaeans], boarding their ships with the strong benches, |501 sailed away, setting their tents on fire. |502 That is what some of the Argives [= Achaeans] were doing. But others of them were in the company of Odysseus, the one with the great glory, and they were already |503 sitting hidden inside the Horse, which was now in the meeting place of the Trojans. |504 The Trojans themselves had pulled the Horse into the acropolis. |505 So there it was, standing there, while they [= the Trojans] were saying many different things, |506 sitting around it. There were three different plans: |507 to cut open the hollow wood with pitiless bronze, |508 or to throw it off the rocky heights after pulling it up to the peak [of the acropolis], |509 or to leave it, great artifact [<em>agalma</em>] that it was, as a charm [<em>thelktērion</em>] of the gods |510 —which, I now see it, was exactly the way it was sure to [<em>mellein</em>] reach an outcome [<em>teleutân</em>], |511 because it was fate [<em>aisa</em>] that the place would be destroyed, once the city had enfolded in itself |512 the great Wooden Horse, when all the best men were sitting inside it, |513 the Argives [= Achaeans], that is, bringing slaughter and destruction upon the Trojans. |514 He sang how the sons of the Achaeans destroyed the city, |515 pouring out of the Horse, leaving behind the hollow place of ambush. |516 He sang how the steep citadel was destroyed by different men in different places. |517 —how Odysseus went to the palace of Deiphobos, |518 how he was looking like Ares, and godlike Menelaos went with him, |519 and how in that place, I now see it, he [= Demodokos] said that he [= Odysseus] dared to go through the worst part of the war, |520 and how he emerged victorious after that, with the help of Athena, the one with the mighty spirit. |521 Thus sang the singer [<em>aoidos</em>], the one whose glory is supreme. And Odysseus |522 dissolved [<em>tēkesthai</em>] into tears. He made wet his cheeks with the tears flowing from his eyelids, |523 just as a woman cries, falling down and embracing her dear husband, |524 who fell in front of the city and people he was defending, |525 trying to ward off the pitiless day of doom hanging over the city and its children. |526 She sees him dying, gasping for his last breath, |527 and she pours herself all over him as she wails with a piercing cry. But there are men behind her, |528 prodding her with their spears, hurting her back and shoulders, |529 and they bring for her a life of bondage, which will give her pain and sorrow. |530 Her cheeks are wasting away with a sorrow [<em>akhos</em>] that is most pitiful [<em>eleeinon</em>]. |531 So also did Odysseus pour out a piteous tear [<em>dakruon</em>] from beneath his brows; |532 there he was, escaping the notice of all while he kept pouring out his tears [<em>dakrua</em>].|533 But Alkinoos was the only one of all of them who was aware, and he took note [<em>noeîn</em>]. </p><p>Complying with the request of Odysseus, Demodokos begins the story of his Third Song at a later point in the story—evidently later than where he had left off before. As signaled at O.08.500, the story begins with the Wooden Horse, exactly as Odysseus had requested. And the story can now focus on the greatest deed accomplished by Odysseus in the Trojan War: he was the hero who invented the Wooden Horse. Here was a feat of intelligence that finally resulted in the capture of Troy by the Achaeans. But the story also focuses on what was perhaps the worst deed of Odysseus in the Trojan War: as we can read in the surviving plot-outline of the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, an epic belonging to the epic Cycle and attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, Odysseus had a major role in the grim story of Troy’s final hours. He was the Achaean hero who captured Andromache, widow of Hector, and who executed the child of this doomed couple. But right before Demodokos reaches this horrific part of the story, Odysseus breaks down in tears, and his tears will interrupt the outcome of this story. The interruption, as we see in the narration that I have just quoted, takes the form of a simile that compares the weeping of the hero with the lament of an unnamed woman who has just been captured in war, O.08.521–531. The simile of the unnamed lamenting woman is substituted for the outcome of the story that tells of the final tearful moments of Troy’s destruction (HC 2§§334–344). In the epic Cycle, as represented by the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, that unnamed lamenting woman would be Andromache (<em>HC</em> 2§344). In the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, the tears of the captive woman lead to the tears of Odysseus, which in turn can now lead to the story of his own odyssey as a continuation of the tearful story that almost ended the narrative continuum at the feast of the Phaeacians. The story can now continue, shifting from an <em>Iliad</em> to an <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:8.499-8.533","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Third Song of Demodokos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"metabainein 'shift forward'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.211455","title":"Odyssey 8.499","body":"<p>This verb <em>hormân</em> (/ <em>hormâsthai</em>), meaning ‘set up (/ get set up) for a point of departure’, is understood as a poetic concept by Plato, <em>Ion</em> 534c.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:8.499","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"hormâsthai ‘get set for a point of departure’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.211503","title":"Odyssey 8.522","body":"<p>The metaphor of ‘dissolving’ into tears while weeping, as expressed here by way of the verb <em>tēkesthai</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’, extends into a further metaphor: with your own tears, you can be ‘pouring all over’ a loved one whom you are embracing: see the comment at O.08.527.
