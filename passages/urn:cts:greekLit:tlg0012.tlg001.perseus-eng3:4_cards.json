But for the Trojans, even as ewes stand in throngs past counting in the court of a man of much substance to be milked of their white milk,<milestone n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>and bleat without ceasing as they near the voices of their lambs: even so arose the clamour of the Trojans throughout the wide host; for they had not all like speech or one language, but their tongues were mingled, and they were a folk summoned from many lands.  These were urged on by Ares, and the Greeks by flashing-eyed Athene,<milestone n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>and Terror, and Rout, and Discord that rageth incessantly, sister and comrade of man-slaying Ares; she at the first rears her crest but little, yet thereafter planteth her head in heaven, while her feet tread on earth.
