The poetic bravura of Demodokos, blind singer of the Phaeacians, will now be superseded by a masterpiece of epic narration performed by Odysseus himself, who is starting to sing his own epic odyssey. The hero’s song will extend from the beginning of Rhapsody 9 here all the way through the end of Rhapsody 12, and the size of this song, consisting of four rhapsodies, will correspond to one-twelfth of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> combined. Odysseus will perform his song in the style of the <em>Homēridai</em>, notional descendants of Homer who performed the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> in relay. The relay performance, which was competitive as well as collaborative, consisted of twelve units, each unit consisting of four rhapsodies, and it took place at the seasonally recurring festival of the Panionia at a place called the Panionion in Asia Minor. As already noted before, this festival was the political and cultural self-expression of the Ionian Dodecapolis, a confederation of twelve states that reached its apogee in the eastern Greek world during the late eighth and early seventh century BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on O.07.321; also on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405; see also under <em>Ionian Dodecapolis </em>in the Words and Ideas.) The division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> into twelve units, six for the <em>Iliad</em> and six for the <em>Odyssey</em>, with each unit containing four rhapsodies, corresponds to the division of the Ionian confederation into twelve states. It may be argued, then, that each one of the twelve states of the Ionian Dodecapolis fielded a rhapsode for performing competitively one of the twelve epic units. Which rhapsode was assigned which one of the twelve epic units could have been determined by lottery or perhaps by way of seasonal rotation. It may also be argued that the rhapsodic unit extending from the start of Rhapsody 9 here all the way through the end of Rhapsody 12 represents an idealized rhapsodic performance in the style of the <em>Homēridai</em>. And Rhapsody 9 begins with a kind of Homeric signature at O.09.03–011—the mark of Homer, as it were.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.1-9.566","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Ionian Dodecapolis"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.212182","title":"Odyssey 9.3-11","body":"<p>|3 ἦ τοι μὲν τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ |4 τοιοῦδ’, οἷος ὅδ’ ἐστί, θεοῖσ’ ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν. |5 οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι τέλος χαριέστερον εἶναι |6 ἢ ὅτ’ ἐϋφροσύνη μὲν ἔχῃ κάτα δῆμον ἅπαντα, |7 δαιτυμόνες δ’ ἀνὰ δώματ’ ἀκουάζωνται ἀοιδοῦ |8 ἥμενοι ἑξείης, παρὰ δὲ πλήθωσι τράπεζαι |9 σίτου καὶ κρειῶν, μέθυ δ’ ἐκ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων |10 οἰνοχόος φορέῃσι καὶ ἐγχείῃ δεπάεσσι· |11 τοῦτό τί μοι κάλλιστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν εἴδεται εἶναι.</p><p>|3 This is indeed a beautiful thing, to listen to a singer [<em>aoidos</em>] |4 such as this one [= Demodokos], the kind of singer that he is, comparable to the gods with the sound of his voice [<em>audē</em>], |5 for I declare, there is no outcome [<em>telos</em>] that is more gratifying [<em>khariestero</em>-]|6 than the moment when the spirit of festivity [<em>euphrosunē</em>] prevails throughout the whole community [<em>dēmos</em>] |7 and the people at the feast [<em>daitumones</em>], throughout the halls, are listening to the singer [<em>aoidos</em>] |8 as they sit there—you can see one after the other—and they are seated at tables that are filled |9 with grain and meat, while wine from the mixing bowl is drawn |10 by the one who pours the wine and takes it around, pouring it into their cups. |11 This kind of thing, as I see it in my way of thinking, is the most beautiful thing in the whole world. </p><p>O.09.003–012</p><p>(Epitomized from MoM 4§§71–73.) As Odysseus himself says here, as he finally proceeds to identify himself, there no greater <em>kharis</em> or ‘gratification’ in the whole world than the combination of good feasting and good singing, and the model for the general reference to singing here is the singer Demodokos. The <em>kharis</em> ‘gratification’ is signaled by the adjective <em>khariestero</em>- ‘more gratifying’ at O.09.005, referring to a <em>telos</em> ‘outcome’: <em>there is no outcome that is more gratifying than what happens at a feast</em>. The word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’, O.09.006, signals the poetic occasion. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198). The feast that is going on here at the beginning of Rhapsody 9 is a continuation of the feast that is already signaled by the word <em>dais </em>at O.08.429, which basically means ‘feast’. In that context, <em>dais</em> refers short-range to an occasion of communal dining as indicated by the word <em>dorpon </em>‘dinner’, O.08.395, which will take place after sunset, O.08.417. The intended guest of honor at this feast will be Odysseus. This occasion of communal dining leads into the third song of Demodokos, O.08.484–485. But this same word <em>dais</em> at O.08.429 is also making a long-range reference: it refers metonymically to a stylized festival that has been ongoing ever since an earlier occasion of communal dining, O.08.071–072, which actually led into the first song of Demodokos. O.08.073–083. And the connectivity goes even further back in time. Leading up to the communal dining, there had been an animal sacrifice as expressed by the word <em>hiereuein</em> ‘sacrificially slaughter’ at O.08.059. Then, the meat of the sacrificed animals had been prepared to be cooked at the feast, O.08.061. And I stress that the word at O.08.061 for ‘feast’ is once again <em>dais</em>. In terms of this sequence, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.3-9.11","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"euphrosunē 'festivity, merriment'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"telos ‘outcome’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"kharis 'gratification; pleasurable beauty'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Metonymy or Metonym"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"stylized festival"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dais 'feast"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.212234","title":"Odyssey 9.5-11","body":"<p>  </p><p>Odysseus’ contemplation of the ideal feast while visiting the Phaeacians presents us with a picture of the sort of situation where <em>kharis</em> (reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of <em>kharis</em>) points to the upholding of good social order, and the meal can be seen as a manifestation of the good social bond in the community.

This time, that which is on the mind of the poet as he recites and, by universal extension, on the minds of all humans, is the speaker of the lines, Odysseus himself. Unlike with the Argo of <em>Odyssey </em>12.69, however, there is a delay here in expressing this universalizing of Odysseus from the mind of the poet to the minds of all humans. The wording begins by saying that I, Odysseus, am linked with 'all' (πᾶσι) my acts of trickery (δόλοισιν), and only then, at line 20, does the wording go on to say the 'I-am-on-the-minds-of' (μέλω) humans. Now the idea that these humans are 'all' (πᾶσι) humans in the universe must be carried over from line 19.

Here at O.09.019–020, Homeric poetry is channeling Odysseus in the act of starting to tell his own story. The wording begins by saying at O.09.019 that I, Odysseus, am linked with ‘all’ (πᾶσι) my acts of trickery, and only then, at O.09.020, does the wording go on to say that ‘I-am-on-the-minds-of’ (μέλω) humans—but now the idea that these humans are ‘all’ (πᾶσι) humans in the universe has to be carried over from the previous line, O.09.019. What we see here is a construction known in ancient rhetoric as <em>apo koinou</em> (ἀπὸ κοινοῦ) ‘by way of shared application’, where a word is applied consecutively to two different syntactical situations. (In 2016.02.11§4, I cite an example in Sappho Song 1 lines 7–8). In the Homeric example that we are now considering, O.09.019–020, the adjective <em>pāsi</em> (πᾶσι) meaning ‘all’ applies first only to the noun <em>doloisi</em> (δόλοισι) meaning ‘acts of trickery’ at line 19, but then at line 20 it applies also—and in a different syntactical situation—to the noun <em>anthrōpoisi</em> (ἀνθρώποισι) meaning ‘humans’. This way, the meaning ‘all’ applies to two different words belonging to two different syntactical situations. And the application of the meaning is consecutive: first, I am linked with ‘all my acts of trickery’, and then, second, I am on the minds of ‘all humans’. The verb <em>melein</em>, which I translate here with the wording ‘be-on-one’s-mind’, normally has as its grammatical subject whatever is on the mind of someone. In everyday contexts, what is on the mind of someone is incidental: someone happens to be thinking about something, and so that something is on the mind of that someone. In Homeric contexts, however, whatever is on someone’s mind is special and worthy of being recorded in poetry. Here is a striking example: when Andromache in the <em>Iliad</em> says to Hector that she is thinking thoughts about the uncertain future that awaits her and the child they had together, he remarks that ‘all these things are-on-my-mind [<em>melei</em>] as well’, I.06.441: ἦ καὶ ἐμοὶ τάδε πάντα μέλει. Such things are the subject of Homeric poetry, and so Homer must have such things on his mind as well. In poetic as also in prosaic contexts, the things that are on someone’s mind may be simply things that this someone is thinking about. But they may be more than that, as in the example I just gave concerning the things that are on the minds of Andromache and Hector. And these things are not just thoughts: they are caring thoughts, concerned thoughts, even worried thoughts. A word that refers to a song about such worried thoughts, as an expression of caring and concern, is <em>merimna</em> ‘care’, as used in the <em>Hippolytus</em> of Euripides, with reference to a custom originating in the city of Trozen, where girls who were celebrating their coming of age are seen in the act of singing and dancing a song. Their song is described as a sad love song, ‘a troubled thought that comes along with songmaking’ (μουσοποιὸς … μέριμνα 1428–1429). The noun that I translate here as ‘a troubled thought’ is <em>merimna</em>, which means literally a ‘care’ or a ‘concern’. A <em>merimna</em>, in other words, is what you have on your mind. In a song of Bacchylides (19.11), the same noun <em>merimna</em>, which I translate here as ‘a troubled thought’, refers to the thought-processes of the poet himself as he is pictured in the act of composing his song. A <em>merimna</em>, then, is a song that is ‘on one’s mind’. Similarly, I argue, the noun <em>melos</em> in the sense of ‘melody’ is derived from <em>melei</em> ‘is on one’s mind’; a <em>melos</em> is a song that is ‘on one’s mind’.

Eustathius (1.9), in the Prolegomena to his commentary on the <em>Iliad</em>, says that performers of the <em>Iliad</em> wore red while performers of the <em>Odyssey</em> wore purple. He may perhaps be guessing when he attributes to ‘the ancients’ the idea that red stands for the blood shed in war, and purple, for the sea, as the setting for the wanderings of Odysseus. Still, his report about the actual dichotomy in color seems to be grounded in tradition. In Homeric diction, we find a parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on ships: we already saw <em>nēes miltoparēioi</em> ‘ships having cheeks of red’ at I.02.637, with reference to the ships of Odysseus, and now we see it again here at O.09.125, with reference to generic ships. To be contrasted is the expression <em>neas</em> <em>phoinīkoparēious</em> ‘ships with cheeks of purple’ at O.11.124 and O.23.271. Moreover, the inventories of chariots in the Linear B tablets show yet another parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on chariots: the noun i-qi-ja ‘chariot’ is described as either mi-to-we-sa = <em>miltówessa</em> ‘red’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4407 or po-ni-ki-ja = <em>phoinikiā</em> ‘purple’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4402.

Even in situations where the <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ of Odysseus in the specialized sense of ‘craft’ helps advance the homecoming of the hero in the <em>Odyssey</em>, it does nothing to advance the <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ of his past epic exploits at Troy. A case in point is the decisive moment in the <em>Odyssey</em> when Odysseus devises the stratagem of calling himself <em>Outis</em> ‘no one’, O.09.366, in order to deceive and then blind Polyphemus the Cyclops. The pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’ used by the hero for the crafting of his false name deceives not only the Cyclops but also the monster’s fellow Cyclopes when they use the same pronoun to ask the blinded Polyphemus this question: <em>perhaps someone has wronged you?</em>—O.09.405–406. The syntax of the question, expressing the uncertainty of the questioners, requires the changing of the pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’ into its modal byform <em>mē tis</em> ‘perhaps someone’, which sounds like the noun <em>mētis </em>‘craft’. The modal byform <em>mē tis </em>is intentionally signaling here the verbal craft used by Odysseus in devising this stratagem. And this intentional act of signaling is made explicit later on when the narrating hero actually refers to his stratagem as a <em>mētis</em>, O.09.414. The same can be said about the hero’s previous stratagem of blinding the Cyclops with a sharpened stake, an act of craftiness compared to the craft of blacksmiths, O.09.390–394. These and all other stratagems used by the hero against the Cyclops qualify as <em>mētis</em> ‘craft’, O.09.422. It goes without saying that the stratagem of crafting the false name <em>Outis</em> succeeds: when the blinded Cyclops answers the question of his fellow Cyclopes, <em>perhaps someone has wronged you?</em>—O.09.405–406—he uses the non-modal form of the pronoun, saying<em> ou tis ‘no one’ has wronged me</em>, O.09.408. Still, though this stratagem succeeds in rescuing Odysseus (and, for the moment, some of his companions), it fails to rescue the hero’s past <em>kleos</em> in Troy. In fact, the stratagem of Odysseus in calling himself <em>Outis</em> ‘no one’ produces just the opposite effect: it erases any previous claim to any <em>kleos</em> that the hero would have had before he entered the cave of the Cyclops. Such erasure is signaled by the epithet <em>outidanos</em> ‘good-for-nothing’, derivative of the pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’: whenever this epithet is applied to a hero in the <em>Iliad</em>, it is intended to revile the name of that hero by erasing his epic identity, as at I.11.390. Such erasure means that someone who used to have a name will now no longer have a name and has therefore become a <em>nobody</em>, a <em>no one</em>, <em>ou tis</em>. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, the Cyclops reviles the name of the man who blinded him by applying this same epithet <em>outidanos</em> ‘good-for-nothing’ to the false name <em>Outis</em>, O.09.460. The effect of applying this epithet completes the erasure of the hero’s past identity that was started by Odysseus when he renamed himself as <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’. The name that the hero had heretofore achieved for himself has been reduced to nothing and must hereafter be rebuilt from nothing. It is relevant that the annihilation of the hero’s identity happens in the darkness of an otherworldly cave, in the context of extinguishing the light of the single eye of the Cyclops, thereby darkening forever the monster’s power to see the truth unless he hears it. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.355-9.422","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"mētis ‘mind, intelligence’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"biē ‘force, violence, strength’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"outidanos 'good-for-nothing'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"outis 'no one'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.214863","title":"Odyssey 9.390-9.394","body":"<p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2007b:61.) The power of the Homeric simile in advancing the plot of epic is evident in the simile here at O.09.390–394, referring to the blinding of the Cyclops: when Odysseus and his men thrust into the single eye of the monster the fire-hardened tip of a wooden stake they had just crafted, the sound produced by this horrific act is compared to the sound produced when a blacksmith is tempering steel as he thrusts into cold water the red-hot edge of the axe or adze he is crafting. From a cross-cultural survey of myths that tell how a hero who stands for the civilizing forces of <em>culture</em> blinds a monster who stands for the brutalizing forces of <em>nature</em>, it becomes clear that such myths serve the purpose of providing an aetiology for <em>the invention of technology</em> (Burkert 1979:33–34). It is no coincidence that the <em>three Cyclopes</em> in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em> (139–146) are imagined as exponents of technology: they are identified as the <em>three blacksmiths</em> who crafted the thunderbolt of Zeus (Burkert 1979:156n23). Thus the simile about the tempering of steel in the Homeric narration of the blinding of the Cyclops serves the purpose of contextualizing and even advancing that narration by way of highlighting aspects of an underlying myth that is otherwise being shaded over. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.390-9.394","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"blinding of the Cyclops"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aetiology"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"nature and culture"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Simile"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"invention of technology"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.214909","title":"Odyssey 9.399","body":"<p>analysis of eukhesthai in its concrete sense ‘say a prayer’ with the adverb megala, in the context of postulating ‘say (in a functionally marked context)’ as antecedent of ‘pray’ (eukhesthai in sacral contexts)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.399","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.214955","title":"Odyssey 9.410","body":"<p>analysis of the pun between mêtis and the name Oûtis.

As argued by Frame 1978:6–33 (also 2009:39–41), the etymology of this participle <em>ásmenos</em> can be explained by deriving it from *<em>n̥s-menos</em>, where the element *<em>n̥s-</em> is the zero grade of the Indo-European root <em>*nes-</em>, meaning ‘return to light and life’. This etymology has been confirmed by de Lamberterie 2014. Here at O.09.566, the etymological explanation ‘returning to light and life’ corresponds to what has just happened to Odysseus and his companions: they have escaped from the darkness of the cave and from the threat of death there, emerging into the light and thus winning back their lives. So, they have literally returnd to light and life. For more on the semantics of ‘return to light and life’ as conveyed by the words <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.003. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:9.566","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ásmenos ‘returning to light and life’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]}]
