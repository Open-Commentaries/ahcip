As he mixed the wine, he prayed much and\n    made drink-offerings to Athena, daughter of Aegis-bearing Zeus. Then, when they\n    had made their drink-offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded, the\n    others went home to bed each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemakhos to\n    sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with Peisistratos, who was\n    the only unmarried son now left him. As for himself, he slept in an inner room\n    of the house, with the queen his wife by his side.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"404\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered\n    Dawn, appeared, Nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white\n    and polished marble that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat\n    Neleus, peer of gods in counsel, but he was now dead, and had gone to the house\n    of Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat, scepter in hand, as guardian of the public\n    weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him, Echephron,\n    Stratios, Perseus, Aretos, and Thrasymedes; the sixth son was Peisistratos, and\n    when Telemakhos joined them they made him sit with them. Nestor then addressed\n    them.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"418"},{"n":"418","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"418\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"418\" unit=\"line\"/>\"My sons,\" said he, \"make haste to do as I\n    shall bid you. I wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess\n    Athena, who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterday's festivities.\n    Go, then, one or other of you to the plain, tell the stockman to look me out a\n    heifer, and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemakhos' ship,\n    and invite all the crew, leaving two men only in charge of the vessel. Some one\n    else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer.\n    The rest, stay all of you where you are; tell the maids in the house to prepare\n    an excellent dinner, and to fetch seats, and logs of wood for a burnt offering.\n    Tell them also to bring me some clear spring water.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>On this they hurried off on their several\n    errands. The heifer was brought in from the plain, and Telemakhos' crew came\n    from the ship; the goldsmith brought the anvil, hammer, and tongs, with which\n    he worked his gold, and Athena herself came to the sacrifice. Nestor gave out\n    the gold, and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might\n    have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratios and Echephron brought her in by\n    the horns; Aretos fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower\n    pattern on it, and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy\n    Thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe, ready to strike the heifer, while\n    Perseus held a bucket. Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling\n    the barley meal, and he offered many a prayer to Athena as he threw a lock from\n    the heifer's head upon the fire.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"447\" unit=\"line\"/>When they had done praying and sprinkling the\n    barley meal Thrasymedes dealt his blow, and brought the heifer down with a\n    stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck, whereon the\n    daughters and daughters-in-law of Nestor, and his venerable wife Eurydice (she\n    was eldest daughter to Klymenos) screamed with delight. Then they lifted the\n    heifer's head from off the ground, and Peisistratos cut her throat. When she\n    had done bleeding and was quite dead, they cut her up. They cut out the thigh\n    bones all in due course, wrapped them round in two layers of fat, and set some\n    pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then Nestor laid them upon the wood fire\n    and poured wine over them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged\n    spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the\n    inward meats, they cut the rest of the meat up small, put the pieces on the\n    spits and toasted them over the fire.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"464\" unit=\"line\"/>Meanwhile lovely Polykaste, Nestor's youngest\n    daughter, washed Telemakhos. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil,\n    she brought him a fair mantle and shirt, and he looked like a god as he came\n    from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the outer meats\n    were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were\n    waited upon by some worthy henchmen, who kept pouring them out their wine in\n    cups of gold. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Nestor said,\n    \"Sons, put Telemakhos' horses to the chariot that he may start at once.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"477"},{"n":"477","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"477\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"477\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had\n    said, and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up\n    a provision of bread, wine, and sweetmeats fit for the sons of princes. Then\n    Telemakhos got into the chariot, while Peisistratos gathered up the reins and\n    took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing\n    loath into the open country, leaving the high citadel of <placeName key=\"perseus,Pylos\">Pylos</placeName> behind them. All that day did they\n    travel, swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness\n    was over all the land. Then they reached <placeName key=\"perseus,Pherai\">Pherai</placeName> where Diokles lived, who was son to Ortilokhos and\n    grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and Diokles entertained them\n    hospitably. When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn; appeared, they again\n    yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing\n    gatehouse. Peisistratos lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing\n    loath; presently they came to the wheat lands of the open country, and in the\n    course of time completed their journey, so well did their steeds take them.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"497\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when the sun had set and darkness was over\n    the land,</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
