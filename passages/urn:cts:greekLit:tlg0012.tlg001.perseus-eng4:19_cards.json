She found her son\n    fallen about the body of Patroklos and weeping bitterly. Many also of his\n    followers were weeping round him, but when the goddess came among them she\n    clasped his hand in her own, saying, \"My son, grieve as we may we must let this\n    man lie, for it is by heaven's will that he has fallen; now, therefore, accept\n    from Hephaistos this rich and goodly armor, which no man has ever yet borne\n    upon his shoulders.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"12\" unit=\"line\"/>As she spoke she set the armor before Achilles,\n    and it rang out bravely as she did so. The Myrmidons were struck with awe, and\n    none dared look full at it, for they were afraid; but Achilles was roused to\n    still greater fury, and his eyes gleamed with a fierce light, for he was glad\n    when he handled the splendid present which the god had made him. Then, as soon\n    as he had satisfied himself with looking at it, he said to his mother, \"Mother,\n    the god has given me armor, meet handiwork for an immortal and such as no\n    living could have fashioned; I will now arm, but I much fear that flies will\n    settle upon the son of Menoitios and breed worms about his wounds, so that his\n    body, now he is dead, will be disfigured and the flesh will rot.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"28\" unit=\"line\"/>Silver-footed Thetis answered, \"My son, be not\n    disquieted about this matter. I will find means to protect him from the swarms\n    of noisome flies that prey on the bodies of men who have been killed in battle.\n    He may lie for a whole year, and his flesh shall still be as sound as ever, or\n    even sounder. Call, therefore, the Achaean heroes in assembly; unsay your anger\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>] against Agamemnon; arm at once, and\n    fight with might and main.\" As she spoke she put strength and courage into his\n    heart, and she then dropped ambrosia and red nectar into the wounds of\n    Patroklos, that his body might suffer no change. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"40\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Achilles went out upon the seashore, and\n    with a loud cry called on the Achaean heroes. On this even those who as yet had\n    stayed always at the assembly of [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>] of ships,\n    the pilots and helmsmen, and even the stewards who were about the ships and\n    served out rations, all came to the place of assembly because Achilles had\n    shown himself after having held aloof so long from fighting. Two squires [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapontes</term>] of Ares, Odysseus and the son of Tydeus,\n    came limping, for their wounds still pained them; nevertheless they came, and\n    took their seats in the front row of the assembly. Last of all came Agamemnon,\n    king of men, he too wounded, for Koön son of Antenor had struck him with a\n    spear in battle. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"54\" unit=\"line\"/>When the Achaeans were got together Achilles\n    rose and said, \"Son of Atreus, surely it would have been better alike for both\n    you and me, when we two were in such high anger about Briseis, surely it would\n    have been better, had Artemis' arrow slain her at the ships on the day when I\n    took her after having sacked Lyrnessos. For so, many an Achaean the less would\n    have bitten dust before the foe in the days of my anger. It has been well for\n    Hektor and the Trojans, but the Achaeans will long indeed remember our quarrel.\n    Now, however, let it be, for it is over. If we have been angry, necessity has\n    schooled our anger. I put it from me: I dare not nurse it for ever; therefore,\n    bid the Achaeans arm forthwith that I may go out against the Trojans, and learn\n    whether they will be in a mind to sleep by the ships or no. Glad, I ween, will\n    he be to rest his knees who may flee my spear when I wield it.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"74\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and the Achaeans rejoiced in\n    that he had put away his anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>]. Then\n    Agamemnon spoke, rising in his place, and not going into the middle of the\n    assembly. \"Danaan heroes,\" said he, \"squires [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapontes</term>] of Ares, it is well to listen when a man stands up to\n    speak, and it is not seemly to interrupt him, or it will go hard even with a\n    practiced speaker. Who can either hear or speak in an uproar? Even the finest\n    orator will be disconcerted by it. I will expound to the son of Peleus, and do\n    you other Achaeans heed me and mark me well. Often have the Achaeans spoken to\n    me of this matter and upbraided me, but it was not I who was responsible [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aitios</term>]: Zeus, and Fate [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">Moira</term>], and Erinys that walks in darkness struck me with derangement\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">atê</term>] when we were assembled on the day that I\n    took from Achilles the prize that had been awarded to him. What could I do? All\n    things are in the hand of heaven, and <term xml:lang=\"grc\">Atê</term>, eldest\n    of Zeus' daughters, shuts men's eyes to their destruction.

He told it out\n    among the gods saying, ‘Hear me all gods and goddesses, that I may speak even\n    as I am minded; this day shall an Eileithuia, helper of women who are in labor,\n    bring a man child into the world who shall be lord over all that dwell about\n    him who are of my blood and lineage.’ Then said Hera all crafty and full of\n    guile, ‘You will play false, and will not hold to the finality [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">telos</term>] of your word. Swear me, O Olympian, swear me a\n    great oath, that he who shall this day fall between the feet of a woman, shall\n    be lord over all that dwell about him who are of your blood and lineage.’ </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"112\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus she spoke, and Zeus suspected her not,\n    but swore the great oath, to his much ruing thereafter. For Hera darted down\n    from the high summit of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, and\n    went in haste to Achaean Argos where she knew that the noble wife of Sthenelos\n    son of Perseus then was. She being with child and in her seventh month, Hera\n    brought the child to birth though there was a month still wanting, but she\n    stayed the offspring of Alkmene, and kept back the Eileithuiai. Then she went\n    to tell Zeus the son of Kronos, and said, ‘Father Zeus, lord of the lightning -\n    I have a word for your ear. There is a fine child born this day, Eurystheus,\n    son to Sthenelos the son of Perseus; he is of your lineage; it is well,\n    therefore, that he should reign over the Argives.’ </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"125"},{"n":"125","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"125\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>\"On this Zeus was stung to the very quick with\n    grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>], and in his rage he caught <term xml:lang=\"grc\">Atê</term> by the hair, and swore a great oath that never\n    should she again invade starry heaven and <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, for she was the bane of all. Then he whirled her round\n    with a twist of his hand, and flung her down from heaven so that she fell on to\n    the fields of mortal men; and he was ever angry with her when he saw his son\n    groaning under the cruel labors [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athloi</term>] that\n    Eurystheus laid upon him. Even so did I grieve when mighty Hektor was killing\n    the Argives at their ships, and all the time I kept thinking of <term xml:lang=\"grc\">Atê</term> who had so baned me. I was blind, and Zeus robbed\n    me of my reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by way\n    of amends. Go, therefore, into battle, you and your people with you.

No man can do battle the livelong day to the going down of\n    the sun if he is without food; however much he may want to fight his strength\n    will fail him before he knows it; hunger and thirst will find him out, and his\n    limbs will grow weary under him. But a man can fight all day if he is full fed\n    with meat and wine; his heart beats high, and his strength will stay till he\n    has routed all his foes; therefore, send the people away and bid them prepare\n    their meal; King Agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence of the\n    assembly, that all may see them and you may be satisfied. Moreover let him\n    swear an oath before the Argives that he has never gone up into the couch of\n    Briseis, nor has lain down with her, even though it is right [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">themis</term>] for humans, both men and women, to do this;\n    and do you, too, show yourself of a gracious mind; let Agamemnon entertain you\n    in his tents with a feast of reconciliation, that so you may have had your dues\n    in full. As for you, son of Atreus, treat people more righteously in future; it\n    is no disgrace even to a king that he should make amends if he was wrong in the\n    first instance.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"184\" unit=\"line\"/>And King Agamemnon answered, \"Son of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, your words please me well, for\n    throughout you have spoken wisely. I will swear as you would have me do; I do\n    so of my own free will, neither shall I take the name of a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> in vain. Let, then, Achilles wait, though he would fain fight\n    at once, and do you others wait also, till the gifts come from my tent and we\n    ratify the oath with sacrifice. Thus, then, do I charge you: choose [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] some noble young Achaeans to go with you, and\n    bring from my tents the gifts that I promised yesterday to Achilles, and bring\n    the women also; furthermore let Talthybios find me a boar from those that are\n    with the host, and make it ready for sacrifice to Zeus and to the sun.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"198\" unit=\"line\"/>Then said Achilles, \"Son of Atreus, king of men\n    Agamemnon, see to these matters at some other season, when there is breathing\n    time and when I am calmer.

Therefore be patient under my words. Fighting is a thing of\n    which men soon surfeit, and when Zeus, who is wars steward, weighs the upshot,\n    it may well prove that the straw which our sickles have reaped is far heavier\n    than the grain. It may not be that the Achaeans should mourn the dead with\n    their bellies; day by day men fall thick and threefold continually; when should\n    we have respite from our sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>]? Let us\n    mourn our dead for a day and bury them out of sight and mind, but let those of\n    us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely.\n    In that hour let no man hold back, waiting for a second summons; such summons\n    shall bode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships; let us rather\n    sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the Trojans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"238\" unit=\"line\"/>When he had thus spoken he took with him the\n    sons of Nestor, with Meges son of Phyleus, Thoas, Meriones, Lykomedes son of\n    Kreontes, and Melanippos, and went to the tent of Agamemnon son of Atreus. The\n    word was not sooner said than the deed was done: they brought out the seven\n    tripods which Agamemnon had promised, with the twenty metal cauldrons and the\n    twelve horses; they also brought the women skilled in useful arts, seven in\n    number, with Briseis, which made eight. Odysseus weighed out the ten talents of\n    gold and then led the way back, while the young Achaeans brought the rest of\n    the gifts, and laid them in the middle of the assembly. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"249"},{"n":"249","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"249\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"249\" unit=\"line\"/>Agamemnon then rose, and Talthybios whose voice\n    was like that of a god came to him with the boar. The son of Atreus drew the\n    knife which he wore by the scabbard of his mighty sword, and began by cutting\n    off some bristles from the boar, lifting up his hands in prayer as he did so.\n    The other Achaeans sat where they were all silent and orderly to hear the king,\n    and Agamemnon looked into the vault of heaven and prayed saying, \"I call Zeus\n    the first and mightiest of all gods to witness, I call also Earth and Sun and\n    the Erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance on him who shall swear falsely,\n    that I have laid no hand upon the girl Briseis, neither to take her to my bed\n    nor otherwise, but that she has remained in my tents inviolate.

The Myrmidons attended to the presents and took them\n    away to the ship of Achilles.

Beautiful as a\n    goddess she wept and said, \"Patroklos, dearest friend, when I went hence I left\n    you living; I return, O prince, to find you dead; thus do fresh sorrows\n    multiply upon me one after the other. I saw him to whom my father and mother\n    married me, cut down before our city, and my three own dear brothers perished\n    with him on the self-same day; but you, Patroklos, even when Achilles slew my\n    husband and sacked the city of noble Mynes, told me that I was not to weep, for\n    you said you would make Achilles marry me, and take me back with him to\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Phthia\">Phthia</placeName>, we should have a wedding\n    feast among the Myrmidons.

The elders of the Achaeans gathered round\n    Achilles and prayed him to take food, but he groaned and would not do so. \"I\n    pray you,\" said he, \"if any comrade will hear me, bid me neither eat nor drink,\n    for I am in great heaviness, and will stay fasting even to the going down of\n    the sun.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"309\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he sent the other princes away, save\n    only the two sons of Atreus and Odysseus, Nestor, Idomeneus, and the horseman\n    Phoenix, who stayed behind and tried to comfort him in the bitterness of his\n    sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>]: but he would not be comforted till\n    he should have flung himself into the jaws of battle, and he fetched sigh on\n    sigh, thinking ever of Patroklos.

There he sits by the ships all desolate for the loss of his dear\n    comrade, and though the others are gone to their dinner he will neither eat nor\n    drink.

She darted down from heaven into the air like some\n    falcon sailing on his broad wings and screaming. Meanwhile the Achaeans were\n    arming throughout the host, and when Athena had dropped nectar and ambrosia\n    into Achilles so that no cruel hunger should cause his limbs to fail him, she\n    went back to the house of her mighty father. Thick as the chill snow-flakes\n    shed from the hand of Zeus and borne on the keen blasts of the north wind, even\n    so thick did the gleaming helmets, the bossed shields, the strongly plated\n    breastplates, and the ashen spears stream from the ships. The sheen pierced the\n    sky, the whole land was radiant with their flashing armor, and the sound of the\n    tramp of their treading rose from under their feet. In the midst of them all\n    Achilles put on his armor; he gnashed his teeth, his eyes gleamed like fire,\n    for his grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] was greater than he could\n    bear. Thus, then, full of fury against the Trojans, did he don the gift of the\n    god, the armor that Hephaistos had made him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"369\" unit=\"line\"/>First he put on the goodly greaves fitted with\n    ankle-clasps, and next he did on the breastplate about his chest. He slung the\n    silver-studded sword of bronze about his shoulders, and then took up the shield\n    so great and strong that shone afar with a splendor as of the moon. As the\n    light seen by sailors from out at sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>],\n    when men have lit a fire in their homestead high up among the mountains, but\n    the sailors are carried out to sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>] by wind\n    and storm far from the haven where they would be - even so did the gleam of\n    Achilles' wondrous shield strike up into the heavens. He lifted the redoubtable\n    helmet, and set it upon his head, from whence it shone like a star, and the\n    golden plumes which Hephaistos had set thick about the ridge of the helmet,\n    waved all around it. Then Achilles made trial of himself in his armor to see\n    whether it fitted him, so that his limbs could play freely under it, and it\n    seemed to buoy him up as though it had been wings. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"387\" unit=\"line\"/>He also drew his father's spear out of the\n    spear-stand, a spear so great and heavy and strong that none of the Achaeans\n    save only Achilles had strength to wield it; this was the spear of Pelian ash\n    from the topmost ridges of Mount Pelion, which Chiron had once given to Peleus,\n    fraught with the death of heroes. Automedon and Alkimos busied themselves with\n    the harnessing of his horses; they made the bands fast about them, and put the\n    bit in their mouths, drawing the reins back towards the chariot. Automedon,\n    whip in hand, sprang up behind the horses, and after him Achilles mounted in\n    full armor, resplendent as the sun-god Hyperion. Then with a loud voice he\n    chided with his father's horses saying, \"<placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> and Balios, famed offspring of Podarge - this time when\n    we have done fighting be sure and bring your driver safely back to the host of\n    the Achaeans, and do not leave him dead on the plain as you did Patroklos.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"404\" unit=\"line\"/>Then fleet <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> answered under the yoke - for white-armed Hera had\n    endowed him with human speech - and he bowed his head till his mane touched the\n    ground as it hung down from under the yoke-band. \"Dread Achilles,\" said he, \"we\n    will indeed save you now, but the day of your death is near, and we will not be\n    responsible [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aitioi</term>], for it will be heaven and\n    stern fate that will destroy you. Neither was it through any sloth or slackness\n    on our part that the Trojans stripped Patroklos of his armor; it was the mighty\n    god whom lovely Leto bore that slew him as he fought among the foremost, and\n    granted a triumph to Hektor. We two can fly as swiftly as Zephyros who they say\n    is fleetest of all winds; nevertheless it is your doom to fall by the hand of a\n    man and of a god.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"418\" unit=\"line\"/>When he had thus spoken, the Erinyes stayed his\n    speech, and Achilles answered him in great sadness, saying, \"Why, O <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName>, do you thus foretell my death?\n    You need not do so, for I well know that I am to fall here, far from my dear\n    father and mother; none the more, however, shall I stay my hand till I have\n    given the Trojans their fill of fighting.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"424\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying, with a loud cry he drove his horses\n    to the front. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
