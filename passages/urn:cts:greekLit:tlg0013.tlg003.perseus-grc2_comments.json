[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.257974","title":"Homeric Hymn to Apollo","body":"<p>As we see from the testimony of the fifth-century historian Thucydides (3.104.6), the chorus of the Delian Maidens who are described in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> are to be viewed as prototypes for the choruses that actually performed at the Delia, that is, at the festival of Apollo at Delos in historical times. At the Delia, as Thucydides (3.104.6) observes, city-states participated in the ritual of ‘sending’ (<em>anagein</em>) their local choruses to perform there as part of a ‘sacrifice’, conveyed by the word <em>hiera</em>, ‘sacrificial offerings’. In fact, a traditional word for a festival like the Delia was <em>thusiā</em>, which literally means ‘sacrifice’. There is a most relevant attestation of both these words, <em>hiera</em> or ‘sacrificial offerings’ and <em>thusiā</em> or ‘sacrifice, festival’, in an account concerning the celebration of the Delia at Delos in the glory days of the Athenian empire. This account, Plutarch’s <em>Life of Nikias </em>3.5-7, gives a full-blown description of the magnificent spectacle of choral performances at the Delia:</p><p>Nikias is remembered for his ambitious accomplishments with regard to Delos - accomplishments most spectacular in all their splendor and most worthy of the gods in all their magnificence. Here is an example. The choral groups [<em>khoroi</em>] that cities used to send [to Delos] for the performances of songs sacred to the god (Apollo) used to sail in [to the harbor of Delos] in a haphazard fashion, and the crowds that would gather to greet the ship used to start right away to call on the performers to start singing their song. There was no coordination, since the performers were still in the process of disembarking in a rushed and disorganized way, and they were still putting on their garlands and changing into their costumes. But when he [= Nikias] was in charge of the sacred voyage [<em>theōriā</em>] [to Delos], he first took a side trip to the island of Rheneia, bringing with him the choral group [<em>khoros</em>] and the sacrificial offerings [<em>hiereia</em>] and all the rest of the equipment. And he brought with him a bridge that had been made in advance, back in Athens, to fit the present occasion, and this bridge was most splendidly adorned with golden fixtures, with dyed colors, with garlands, with tapestries. Overnight, he took this bridge and spanned with it the strait between Rheneia and Delos - not a very great distance. |3.6 Then, come daylight, he led the procession in honor of the god and brought across the bridge to their destination the performers of the choral group [<em>khoros</em>], who were outfitted most magnificently and were all along performing their song. |3.7 Then, after the sacrifice [<em>thusiā</em>] and after the competition [<em>agōn</em>] and after the feasting, he set up as a dedication to the god the [famous] bronze palm tree.</p><p>Plutarch <em>Life of Nikias</em> 3.5-7</p><p>μνημονεύεται δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ περὶ Δῆλον ὡς λαμπρὰ καὶ θεοπρεπῆ φιλοτιμήματα. τῶν γὰρ χορῶν, οὓς αἱ πόλεις ἔπεμπον ᾀσομένους τῷ θεῷ, προσπλεόντων μὲν ὡς ἔτυχεν, εὐθὺς δ’ ὄχλου πρὸς τὴν ναῦν
