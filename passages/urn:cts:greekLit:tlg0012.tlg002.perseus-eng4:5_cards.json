She at once set herself to\n    think how she could speed Odysseus on his way. So she gave him a great bronze\n    axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful\n    olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and\n    then led the way to the far end of the island where the largest trees grew -\n    alder, poplar and pine, that reached the sky - very dry and well seasoned, so\n    as to sail light for him in the water. Then, when she had shown him where the\n    best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut them, which he soon\n    finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth, squaring\n    them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back with some\n    augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers together with bolts\n    and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled shipwright makes the beam of\n    a large vessel, and he filed a deck on top of the ribs, and ran a gunwale all\n    round it. He also made a mast with a yard arm, and a rudder to steer with. He\n    fenced the raft all round with wicker hurdles as a protection against the\n    waves, and then he threw on a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him\n    some linen to make the sails, and he made these too, excellently, making them\n    fast with braces and sheets.

She gave him a goat skin full of black wine, and\n    another larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions, and\n    found him in much good meat. Moreover, she made the wind fair and warm for him,\n    and gladly did Odysseus spread his sail before it, while he sat and guided the\n    raft skillfully by means of the rudder. He never closed his eyes, but kept them\n    fixed on the Pleiads, on late-setting Boötes, and on the Bear - which men also\n    call the Wain, and which turns round and round where it is, facing Orion, and\n    alone never dipping into the stream of Okeanos - for Calypso had told him to\n    keep this to his left. Seventeen days did he sail over the sea, and on the\n    eighteenth the dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the\n    Phaeacian coast appeared, rising like a shield on the horizon.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"282\" unit=\"line\"/>But lord Poseidon, who was returning from the\n    Ethiopians, caught sight of Odysseus a long way off, from the mountains of the\n    Solymi.

Winds from East, South, North, and West fell upon him\n    all at the same time, and a tremendous sea got up, so that Odysseus’ heart\n    began to fail him. \"Alas,\" he said to himself in his dismay, \"what ever will\n    become of me?

For\n    a long time Odysseus was under water, and it was all he could do to rise to the\n    surface again, for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him down; but at\n    last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter brine that was running\n    down his face in streams. In spite of all this, however, he did not lose sight\n    of his raft, but swam as fast as he could towards it, got hold of it, and\n    climbed on board again so as to escape drowning. The sea took the raft and\n    tossed it about as Autumn winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road.\n    (It was as though the South, North, East, and West winds were all at once\n    tossing it back and forth.)</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"333"},{"n":"333","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"333\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"333\" unit=\"line\"/>When he was in this plight, Ino daughter of\n    Cadmus, also called Leukothea, saw him.

By and by, as he swam on, he came to the mouth of a river, and here he\n    thought would be the best place, for there were no rocks, and it afforded\n    shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a current, so he prayed inwardly\n    and said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Hear me, O King, whoever you may be, and save\n    me from the anger of the sea-god Poseidon, for I approach you prayerfully.\n    Anyone who has lost his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,\n    wherefore in my distress I draw near to your stream, and cling to the knees of\n    your riverhood. Have mercy upon me, O king, for I declare myself your\n    suppliant.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"451\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the god stayed his stream and stilled the\n    waves, making all calm before him, and bringing him safely into the mouth of\n    the river. Here at last Odysseus’ knees and strong hands failed him, for the\n    sea had completely broken him. His body was all swollen, and his mouth and\n    nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water, so that he could neither breathe\n    nor speak, and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently, when he had got\n    his breath and came to himself again, he took off the scarf that Ino had given\n    him and threw it back into the salt stream of the river, whereon Ino received\n    it into her hands from the wave that bore it towards her. Then he left the\n    river, laid himself down among the rushes, and kissed the bounteous earth.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"464\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Alas,\" he cried to himself in his dismay,\n    \"what ever will become of me, and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the\n    river bed through the long watches of the night, I am so exhausted that the\n    bitter cold and damp may make an end of me - for towards sunrise there will be\n    a keen wind blowing from off the river. If, on the other hand, I climb the hill\n    side, find shelter in the woods, and sleep in some thicket, I may escape the\n    cold and have a good night's rest, but some savage beast may take advantage of\n    me and devour me.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"474"},{"n":"474","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"474\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"474\" unit=\"line\"/>In the end he deemed it best to take to the\n    woods, and he found one upon some high ground not far from the water. There he\n    crept beneath two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock - the one\n    ungrafted, while the other had been grafted. No wind, however squally, could\n    break through the cover they afforded, nor could the sun's rays pierce them,\n    nor the rain get through them, so closely did they grow into one another.\n    Odysseus crept under these and began to make himself a bed to lie on, for there\n    was a great litter of dead leaves lying about - enough to make a covering for\n    two or three men even in hard winter weather. He was glad enough to see this,\n    so he laid himself down and heaped the leaves all round him. Then, as one who\n    lives alone in the country, far from any neighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed\n    in the ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere, even so did\n    Odysseus cover himself up with leaves; and Athena shed a sweet sleep upon his\n    eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose all memories of his sorrows\n    <milestone n=\"493\" unit=\"line\"/>.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
