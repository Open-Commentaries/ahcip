Now, therefore, let us all\n    do as I say; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the\n    ships, but let those of us who profess to be the flower of the army stand firm,\n    and see whether we cannot hold Hektor back at the point of our spears as soon\n    as he comes near us; I conceive that he will then think better of it before he\n    tries to charge into the press of the Danaans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"300\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and they did even as he had\n    said.

Many a spear sped from strong hands and fastened in the bodies\n    of many a valiant warrior, while others fell to earth midway, before they could\n    taste of man's fair flesh and glut themselves with blood. So long as Phoebus\n    Apollo held his aegis quietly and without shaking it, the weapons on either\n    side took effect and the people fell, but when he shook it straight in the face\n    of the Danaans and raised his mighty battle-cry their hearts fainted within\n    them and they forgot their former prowess. As when two wild beasts spring in\n    the dead of night on a herd of cattle or a large flock of sheep when the\n    herdsman is not there - even so were the Danaans struck helpless, for Apollo\n    filled them with panic and gave victory to Hektor and the Trojans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"328\" unit=\"line\"/>The fight then became more scattered and they\n    killed one another where they best could.

The two sides fought\n    with their double-pointed spears in hand-to-hand encounter-the Trojans from\n    their chariots, and the Achaeans climbing up into their ships and wielding the\n    long pikes that were lying on the decks ready for use in a sea-fight, jointed\n    and shod with bronze. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"390\" unit=\"line\"/>Now Patroklos, so long as the Achaeans and\n    Trojans were fighting about the wall, but were not yet within it and at the\n    ships, remained sitting in the tent of good Eurypylos, entertaining him with\n    his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain. When,\n    however, he saw the Trojans swarming through the breach in the wall, while the\n    Achaeans were clamoring and struck with panic, he cried aloud, and smote his\n    two thighs with the flat of his hands. \"Eurypylos,\" said he in his dismay, \"I\n    know you want me badly, but I cannot stay with you any longer, for there is\n    hard fighting going on; a squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] shall\n    take care of you now, for I must make all speed to Achilles, and induce him to\n    fight if I can; who knows but with the help of a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> I may persuade him.

When Hektor saw his cousin\n    fallen in front of the ship he shouted to the Trojans and Lycians saying,\n    \"Trojans, Lycians, and Dardanians good in close fight, bate not a jot, but\n    rescue the son of Klytios lest the Achaeans strip him of his armor now that he\n    has fallen in the struggle [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">agôn</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>He then aimed a spear at Ajax, and missed him,\n    but he hit Lykophron a follower [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] of Ajax,\n    who came from <placeName key=\"tgn,7010869\">Cythera</placeName>, but was living\n    with Ajax inasmuch as he had killed a man among the Cythereans. Hektor's spear\n    struck him on the head below the ear, and he fell headlong from the ship's prow\n    on to the ground with no life left in him. Ajax shook with rage and said to his\n    brother, \"Teucer, my good man, our trusty comrade the son of Mastor has fallen,\n    he came to live with us from <placeName key=\"tgn,7010869\">Cythera</placeName>\n    and whom we honored as much as our own parents. Hektor has just killed him;\n    fetch your deadly arrows at once and the bow which Phoebus Apollo gave you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"442\" unit=\"line\"/>Teucer heard him and hastened towards him with\n    his bow and quiver in his hands. Forthwith he showered his arrows on the\n    Trojans, and hit Kleitos the son of Pisenor, comrade of Polydamas the noble son\n    of Panthoos, with the reins in his hands as he was attending to his horses; he\n    was in the middle of the very thickest part of the fight, doing good service to\n    Hektor and the Trojans, but evil had now come upon him, and not one of those\n    who were fain to do so could avert it, for the arrow struck him on the back of\n    the neck. He fell from his chariot and his horses shook the empty car as they\n    swerved aside. King Polydamas saw what had happened, and was the first to come\n    up to the horses; he gave them in charge to Astynoos son of Protiaon, and\n    ordered him to look on, and to keep the horses near at hand. He then went back\n    and took his place in the front ranks. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"458\" unit=\"line\"/>Teucer then aimed another arrow at Hektor, and\n    there would have been no more fighting at the ships if he had hit him and\n    killed him then and there: but Teucer did not escape the notice [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] of Zeus, who kept watch over Hektor and deprived\n    him of his triumph, by breaking his bowstring for him just as he was drawing it\n    and about to take his aim; on this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from\n    his hands. Teucer shook with anger and said to his brother, \"Alas, see how a\n    <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> thwarts us in all we do; he has broken my\n    bowstring and snatched the bow from my hand, though I strung it this selfsame\n    morning that it might serve me for many an arrow.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"472"},{"n":"472","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"472\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"472\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"My good man, let\n    your bow and your arrows be, for Zeus has made them useless in order to spite\n    the Danaans. Take your spear, lay your shield upon your shoulder, and both\n    fight the Trojans yourself and urge others to do so. They may be successful for\n    the moment but if we fight as we ought they will find it a hard matter to take\n    the ships.\" Teucer then took his bow and put it by in his tent. He hung a\n    shield four hides thick about his shoulders, and on his comely head he set his\n    helmet well wrought with a crest of horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it;\n    he grasped his redoubtable bronze-shod spear, and forthwith he was by the side\n    of Ajax. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"484\" unit=\"line\"/>When Hektor saw that Teucer's bow was of no\n    more use to him, he shouted out to the Trojans and Lycians, \"Trojans, Lycians,\n    and Dardanians good in close fight, be men, my friends, and show your mettle\n    here at the ships, for I see the weapon of one of their chieftains made useless\n    by the hand of Zeus. It is easy to see when Zeus is helping people and means to\n    help them still further, or again when he is bringing them down and will do\n    nothing for them; he is now on our side, and is going against the Argives.\n    Therefore swarm round the ships and fight. If any of you is struck by spear or\n    sword and loses his life, let him die; he dies with honor who dies fighting for\n    his country; and he will leave his wife and children safe behind him, with his\n    house and allotment unplundered if only the Achaeans can be driven back to\n    their own land, they and their ships.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he put heart and soul into\n    them all. Ajax on the other side exhorted his comrades saying, \"Shame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>] on you Argives, we are now utterly undone,\n    unless we can save ourselves by driving the enemy from our ships. Do you think,\n    if Hektor takes them, that you will be able to get home by land? Can you not\n    hear him cheering on his whole host to fire our fleet, and bidding them\n    remember that they are not at a dance [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">khoros</term>] but\n    in battle? Our only thought [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] and plan [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mêtis</term>] is to fight them with might and main; we had\n    better chance it, life or death, once for all, than fight long and without\n    issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"514\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he put life [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">menos</term>] and spirit [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">thumos</term>]\n    into them all. Hektor then killed Schedios son of Perimedes, leader of the\n    Phoceans, and Ajax killed Laodamas leader of foot soldiers and son to Antenor.\n    Polydamas killed Otos of Cyllene a comrade of the son of Phyleus and chief of\n    the proud Epeans. When Meges saw this he sprang upon him, but Polydamas\n    crouched down, and he missed him, for Apollo would not suffer the son of\n    Panthoos to fall in battle; but the spear hit Croesmus in the middle of his\n    chest, whereon he fell heavily to the ground, and Meges stripped him of his\n    armor. At that moment the valiant warrior Dolops son of Lampos sprang upon\n    Lampos was son of Laomedon and for his valor, while his son Dolops was versed\n    in all the ways of war. He then struck the middle of the son of Phyleus' shield\n    with his spear, setting on him at close quarters, but his good corselet made\n    with plates of metal saved him; Phyleus had brought it from <placeName key=\"perseus,Ephyra\">Ephyra</placeName> and the river Selleis, where his\n    host, King Euphetes, had given it him to wear in battle and protect him. It now\n    served to save the life of his son. Then Meges struck the topmost crest of\n    Dolops' bronze helmet with his spear</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"536\" unit=\"line\"/>and tore away its plume of horse-hair, so that\n    all newly dyed with scarlet as it was it tumbled down into the dust. While he\n    was still fighting and confident of victory, Menelaos came up to help Meges,\n    and got by the side of Dolops unperceived; he then speared him in the shoulder,\n    from behind, and the point, driven so furiously, went through into his chest,\n    whereon he fell headlong. The two then made towards him to strip him of his\n    armor, but Hektor called on all his brothers for help, and he especially\n    upbraided brave Melanippos son of Hiketaon, who erewhile used to pasture his\n    herds of cattle in Perkote before the war broke out; but when the ships of the\n    Danaans came, he went back to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>,\n    where he was eminent among the Trojans, and lived near Priam who treated him as\n    one of his own sons. Hektor now rebuked him and said, \"Why, Melanippos, are we\n    thus remiss? do you take no note of the death of your kinsman, and do you not\n    see how they are trying to take Dolops' armor? Follow me; there must be no\n    fighting the Argives from a distance now, but we must do so in close combat\n    till either we kill them or they take the high wall of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> and slay her people.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"559\" unit=\"line\"/>He led on as he spoke, and the hero Melanippos\n    followed after. Meanwhile Ajax son of Telamon was cheering on the Argives. \"My\n    friends,\" he cried, \"be men, and fear the loss of respect [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>]; quit yourselves in battle so as to win respect from one\n    another. Men who respect each other's good opinion are less likely to be killed\n    than those who do not, but in flight there is neither gain nor glory [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"565\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he exhort men who were already bent\n    upon driving back the Trojans. They laid his words to heart and hedged the\n    ships as with a wall of bronze, while Zeus urged on the Trojans. Menelaos of\n    the loud battle-cry urged Antilokhos on. \"Antilokhos,\" said he, \"you are young\n    and there is none of the Achaeans more fleet of foot or more valiant than you\n    are. See if you cannot spring upon some Trojan and kill him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"572\" unit=\"line\"/>He hurried away when he had thus spurred\n    Antilokhos, who at once darted out from the front ranks and aimed a spear,\n    after looking carefully round him. The Trojans fell back as he threw, and the\n    dart did not speed from his hand without effect, for it struck Melanippos the\n    proud son of Hiketaon in the breast by the nipple as he was coming forward, and\n    his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground. Antilokhos\n    sprang upon him as a dog springs on a fawn which a hunter has hit as it was\n    breaking away from its covert, and killed it. Even so, O Melanippos, did\n    stalwart Antilokhos spring upon you to strip you of your armor; but noble\n    Hektor marked him, and came running up to him through the thick of the battle.\n    Antilokhos, brave warrior though he was, would not stay to face him, but fled\n    like some savage creature which knows it has done wrong, and flies, when it has\n    killed a dog or a man who is herding his cattle, before a body of men can be\n    gathered to attack it. Even so did the son of Nestor flee, and the Trojans and\n    Hektor with a cry that rent the air showered their weapons after him; nor did\n    he turn round and stay his flight till he had reached his comrades. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"592"},{"n":"592","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"592\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"592\" unit=\"line\"/>The Trojans, fierce as lions, were still\n    rushing on towards the ships in fulfillment of the behests of Zeus who kept\n    spurring them on to new deeds of daring, while he deadened the courage of the\n    Argives and defeated them by encouraging the Trojans. For he meant giving glory\n    to Hektor son of Priam, and letting him throw fire upon the ships, till he had\n    fulfilled the unrighteous prayer that Thetis had made him; Zeus, therefore,\n    bided his time till he should see the glare of a blazing ship. From that hour\n    he was about so to order that the Trojans should be driven back from the ships\n    and to grant glory to the Achaeans. With this purpose he inspired Hektor son of\n    Priam, who was eager enough already, to assail the ships. His fury was as that\n    of Ares, or as when a fire is raging in the glades of some dense forest upon\n    the mountains; he foamed at the mouth, his eyes glared under his terrible\n    eye-brows, and his helmet quivered on his temples by reason of the fury with\n    which he fought.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"610\" unit=\"line\"/>Zeus from heaven was with him, and though he\n    was but one against many, granted him victory and glory; for he was doomed to\n    an early death, and already Pallas Athena was hurrying on the hour of his\n    destruction at the hands of the son of Peleus. Now, however, he kept trying to\n    break the ranks of the enemy wherever he could see them thickest, and in the\n    goodliest armor; but do what he might he could not break through them, for they\n    stood as a tower foursquare, or as some high cliff rising from the gray sea\n    that braves the anger of the gale, and of the waves that thunder up against it.\n    He fell upon them like flames of fire from every quarter. As when a wave,\n    raised mountain high by wind and storm, breaks over a ship and covers it deep\n    in foam, the fierce winds roar against the mast, the hearts of the sailors fail\n    them for fear, and they are saved but by a very little from destruction - even\n    so were the hearts of the Achaeans fainting within them. Or as a savage lion\n    attacking a herd of cows while they are feeding by thousands in the low-lying\n    meadows by some wide-watered shore - the herdsman is at his wit's end how to\n    protect his herd and keeps going about now in the van and now in the rear of\n    his cattle, while the lion springs into the thick of them and fastens on a cow\n    so that they all tremble for fear - even so were the Achaeans utterly\n    panic-stricken by Hektor and father Zeus. Nevertheless Hektor only killed\n    Periphetes of <placeName key=\"perseus,Mycenae\">Mycenae</placeName>; he was son\n    of Kopreus who was wont to take the orders of King Eurystheus to mighty\n    Herakles, but the son was far better in excellence [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aretê</term>] than the father in every way; he was fleet of foot, a valiant\n    warrior, and in understanding [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] ranked among\n    the foremost men of <placeName key=\"perseus,Mycenae\">Mycenae</placeName>. He it\n    was who then afforded Hektor a triumph, for as he was turning back he stumbled\n    against the rim of his shield which reached his feet, and served to keep the\n    javelins off him. He tripped against this and fell face upward, his helmet\n    ringing loudly about his head as he did so. Hektor saw him fall and ran up to\n    him; he then thrust a spear into his chest, and killed him close to his own\n    comrades. These, for all their sorrow, could not help him for they were\n    themselves terribly afraid of Hektor. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"653\" unit=\"line\"/>They had now reached the ships and the prows of\n    those that had been drawn up first were on every side of them, but the Trojans\n    came pouring after them.

You would have thought the men were coming on fresh and unwearied, so\n    fiercely did they fight; and this was the mind [noos] in which they were - the\n    Achaeans did not believe they should escape destruction but thought themselves\n    doomed, while there was not a Trojan but his heart beat high with the hope of\n    firing the ships and putting the Achaean heroes to the sword. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"703"},{"n":"703","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"703\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"703\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus were the two sides minded. Then Hektor\n    seized the stern of the good ship that had brought Protesilaos to <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, but never bore him back to his native\n    land. Round this ship there raged a close hand-to-hand fight between Danaans\n    and Trojans. They did not fight at a distance with bows and javelins, but with\n    one mind hacked at one another in close combat with their mighty swords and\n    spears pointed at both ends; they fought moreover with keen battle-axes and\n    with hatchets. Many a good stout blade hilted and scabbarded with iron, fell\n    from hand or shoulder as they fought, and the earth ran red with blood. Hektor,\n    when he had seized the ship, would not loose his hold but held on to its curved\n    stern and shouted to the Trojans, \"Bring fire, and raise the battle-cry all of\n    you with a single voice. Now has Zeus granted us a day that will pay us for all\n    the rest; this day we shall take the ships which came hither against heaven's\n    will, and which have caused us such infinite suffering through the cowardice of\n    our councilors, who when I would have done battle at the ships held me back and\n    forbade the host to follow me; if Zeus did then indeed warp our judgments,\n    himself now commands me and cheers me on.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"726\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke thus the Trojans sprang yet more\n    fiercely on the Achaeans, and Ajax no longer held his ground, for he was\n    overcome by the darts that were flung at him, and made sure that he was doomed.\n    Therefore he left the raised deck at the stern, and stepped back on to the\n    seven-foot bench of the oarsmen. Here he stood on the look-out, and with his\n    spear held back Trojan whom he saw bringing fire to the ships.
