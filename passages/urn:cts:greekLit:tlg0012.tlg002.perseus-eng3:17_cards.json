He said that he had seen Odysseus in an island in grievous distress, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who keeps him there perforce. And he cannot come to his own native land, for he has at hand no ships with oars, and no comrades,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>to send him on his way over the broad back of the sea.’\n    “So spoke Menelaus, son of Atreus, the famous spearman.

Straightway he entered in and sat down among the wooers over against Eurymachus, for he loved him best of all. Then by him those that served set a portion of meat, and the grave housewife brought and set before him bread,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"260\" unit=\"line\"/>for him to eat. And Odysseus and the goodly swineherd halted as they drew nigh, and about them rang the sound of the hollow lyre, for Phemius was striking the chords to sing before the wooers.

There is building upon building, and the court is built with wall and coping, and the double gates are well-fenced; no man may scorn it.

And Eumaeus looked about him and took a stool that lay near, on which the carver was wont to sit when carving for the wooers the many joints of meat, as they feasted in the hall. This he took and placed at the table of Telemachus, over against him, and there sat down himself.

He sat down upon the ashen threshold within the doorway,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"340\" unit=\"line\"/>leaning against a post of cypress wood, which of old a carpenter had skilfully planed, and made straight to the line. Then Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and, taking a whole loaf from out the beautiful basket, and all the meat his hands could hold in their grasp, spoke to him saying:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"345\" unit=\"line\"/>“Take, and give this mess to yon stranger, and bid him go about himself and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame is no good comrade for a man that is in need.”\n    So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he had heard this saying, and coming up to Odysseus spoke to him winged words:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"350\" unit=\"line\"/>“Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these, and bids thee go about and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame, he says, is no good thing in a beggar man.”\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said, “King Zeus, grant, I pray thee, that Telemachus may be blest among men,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"355\" unit=\"line\"/>and may have all that his heart desires.”\n    He spoke, and took the mess in both his hands and set it down there before his feet on his miserable wallet. Then he ate so long as the minstrel sang in the halls. But when he had dined and the divine minstrel was ceasing to sing,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"360\" unit=\"line\"/>the wooers broke into uproar throughout the halls; but Athena drew close to the side of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and roused him to go among the wooers and gather bits of bread, and learn which of them were righteous and which lawless. Yet even so she was not minded to save one of them from ruin.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"365\" unit=\"line\"/>So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar. And they pitied him and gave, and marvelled at him, asking one another who he was and whence he came.\n    Then among them spoke Melanthius, the goatherd:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"370\" unit=\"line\"/>“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, regarding this stranger, for verily I have seen him before. Truly it was the swineherd that led him hither, but of the man himself I know not surely from whence he declares his birth to be.”\n    So he spoke, and Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"375\" unit=\"line\"/>“Notorious swineherd, why, pray, didst thou bring this man to the city?

For these men are bidden all over the boundless earth. Yet a beggar would no man bid to be burden to himself. But thou art ever harsh above all the wooers to the slaves of Odysseus, and most of all to me; yet I<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"390\" unit=\"line\"/>care not, so long as my lady, the constant Penelope, lives in the hall, and godlike Telemachus.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Be silent: do not, I bid thee, answer yonder man with many words, for Antinous is wont ever in evil wise to provoke to anger<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"395\" unit=\"line\"/>with harsh words, aye, and urges on the others too.”\n    With this he spoke winged words to Antinous: “Antinous, truly thou carest well for me, as a father for his son, seeing that thou biddest me drive yonder stranger from the hall with a word of compulsion. May the god never bring such a thing to pass.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay, take and give him somewhat: I begrudge it not, but rather myself bid thee give. In this matter regard not my mother, no, nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But verily far other is the thought in thy breast; for thou art far more fain thyself to eat than to give to another.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Antinous answered him, and said: “Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said! If all the wooers would but hand him as much as I, for full three months' space this house would keep him at a distance.”\n    So he spoke, and seized the footstool<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>on which he was wont to rest his shining feet as he feasted, and shewed it from beneath the table, where it lay. But all the rest gave gifts, and filled the wallet with bread and bits of meat. And now Odysseus was like to have gone back again to the threshold, and to have made trial of the Achaeans without cost,<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> but he paused by Antinous, and spoke to him, saying: \n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>“Friend, give me some gift; thou seemest not in my eyes to be the basest of the Achaeans, but rather the noblest, for thou art like a king. Therefore it is meet that thou shouldest give even a better portion of bread than the rest; so would I make thy fame known all over the boundless earth. For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting, and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"424"},{"n":"424","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"424\">\n    <p>\n    But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught—so, I ween, was his good pleasure—<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>who sent me forth with roaming pirates to go to <placeName key=\"tgn,7016833\">Egypt</placeName>, a far voyage, that I might meet my ruin; and in the river <placeName key=\"tgn,7016833\">Aegyptus</placeName> I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships and to guard the ships,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of <placeName key=\"tgn,7016833\">Egypt</placeName>; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen and chariots and the flashing of bronze. And Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had courage to take his stand and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a friend who met them to take to <placeName key=\"tgn,1000112\">Cyprus</placeName>, even to Dmetor, son of Iasus, who ruled mightily over <placeName key=\"tgn,1000112\">Cyprus</placeName>; and from thence am I now come hither, sore distressed.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Antinous answered him, and said: “What god has brought this bane hither to trouble our feast? Stand off yonder in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come presently to a bitter <placeName key=\"tgn,7016833\">Egypt</placeName> and a bitter <placeName key=\"tgn,1000112\">Cyprus</placeName>, seeing that thou art a bold and shameless beggar.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>Thou comest up to every man in turn, and they give recklessly; for there is no restraint or scruple in giving freely of another's goods, since each man has plenty beside him.”\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles drew back, and said to him: “Lo, now, it seems that thou at least hast not wits to match thy beauty.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Thou wouldest not out of thine own substance give even a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now, when sitting at another's table, hadst not the heart to take of the bread and give me aught. Yet here lies plenty at thy hand.”\n    So he spoke, and Antinous waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>“Now verily, methinks, thou shalt no more go forth from the hall in seemly fashion, since thou dost even utter words of reviling.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"462"},{"n":"462","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"462\">\n    <p>\n    So saying, he seized the footstool and flung it, and struck Odysseus on the base of the right shoulder, where it joins the back. But he stood firm as a rock, nor did the missile of Antinous make him reel;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Then back to the threshold he went and sat down, and down he laid his well-filled wallet; and he spoke among the wooers: \n    “Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>Verily there is no pain of heart nor any grief when a man is smitten while fighting for his own possessions, whether for his cattle or for his white sheep; but Antinous has smitten me for my wretched belly's sake, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>Ah, if for beggars there are gods and avengers, may the doom of death come upon Antinous before his marriage.”\n    Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Sit still, and eat, stranger, or go elsewhere; lest the young men drag thee<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>by hand or foot through the house for words like these, and strip off all thy skin.”\n    So he spoke, but they all were filled with exceeding indignation, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:\n    “Antinous, thou didst not well to strike the wretched wanderer. Doomed man that thou art, what if haply he be some god come down from heaven!<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>Aye, and the gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men.”\n    So spoke the wooers, but Antinous paid no heed to their words. And Telemachus nursed in his heart great grief<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>for the smiting, though he let no tear fall from his eyelids to the ground; but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart.\n    Howbeit when wise Penelope heard of the man's being smitten in the hall, she spoke among her handmaids, and said: “Even so may thine own self be smitten by the famed archer Apollo.” \n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>And again the housewife Eurynome said to her: “Would that fulfillment might be granted to our prayers. So should not one of these men come to the fair-throned Dawn.”\n    And wise Penelope answered her: “Nurse, enemies are they all, for they devise evil.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>But Antinous more than all is like black fate. Some wretched stranger roams through the house, begging alms of the men, for want compels him, and all the others filled his wallet and gave him gifts, but Antinous flung a footstool and smote him at the base of the right shoulder.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"505"},{"n":"505","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"505\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"505\" unit=\"line\"/>So she spoke among her handmaids, sitting in her chamber, while goodly Odysseus was at meat. Then she called to her the goodly swineherd, and said:\n    “Go, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I may give him greeting, and ask him<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"510\" unit=\"line\"/>if haply he has heard of Odysseus of the steadfast heart, or has seen him with his eyes. He seems like one that has wandered far.”\n    To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I would, O queen, that the Achaeans would keep silence, for he speaks such words as would charm thy very soul.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>Three nights I had him by me, and three days I kept him in my hut, for to me first he came when he fled by stealth from a ship, but he had not yet ended the tale of his sufferings. Even as when a man gazes upon a minstrel who sings to mortals songs of longing that the gods have taught him,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>and their desire to hear him has no end, whensoever he sings, even so he charmed me as he sat in my hall. He says that he is an ancestral friend of Odysseus, and that he dwells in <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName>, where is the race of Minos. From thence has he now come on this journey hither, ever suffering woes<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>as he wanders on and on. And he insists that he has heard tidings of Odysseus, near at hand in the rich land of the Thesprotians and yet alive; and he is bringing many treasures to his home.”\n    Then wise Penelope answered him: “Go, call him hither, that he may himself tell me to my face.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>But as for these men, let them make sport as they sit in the doorway or here in the house, since their hearts are merry. For their own possessions lie untouched in their homes, bread and sweet wine, and on these do their servants feed. But themselves throng our house day after day,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"535\" unit=\"line\"/>slaying our oxen, and sheep, and fat goats, and keep revel and drink the flaming wine recklessly, and havoc is made of all this wealth, for there is no man here such as Odysseus was to keep ruin from the house. But if Odysseus should come and return to his native land,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>straightway would he with his son take vengeance on these men for their violent deeds.”\n    So she spoke, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and all the room round about echoed wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and straightway spoke to Eumaeus winged words:\n    “Go, pray, call the stranger here before me.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"545\" unit=\"line\"/>Dost thou not note that my son has sneezed at all my words. Therefore shall utter death fall upon the wooers one and all, nor shall one of them escape death and the fates. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If I find that he speaks all things truly,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"550\" unit=\"line\"/>I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment.”\n    So she spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying; and coming up to Odysseus he spoke to him winged words: \n    “Sir stranger, wise Penelope calls for thee, the mother of Telemachus, and her heart<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"555\" unit=\"line\"/>bids her make enquiry about her husband, though she has suffered many woes. And if she finds that thou speakest all things truly, she will clothe thee in a cloak and tunic, which thou needest most of all. As for thy food, thou shalt beg it through the land, and feed thy belly, and whoso will shall give it thee.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"560"},{"n":"560","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"560\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"560\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the much-enduring goodly Odysseus answered him: “Eumaeus, soon will I tell all the truth to the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope. For well do I know of Odysseus, and in common have we borne affliction. But I have fear of this throng of harsh wooers,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"565\" unit=\"line\"/>whose wantonness and violence reach the iron heaven. For even now, when, as I was going through the hall doing no evil, this man struck me and hurt me, neither Telemachus nor any other did aught to ward off the blow. Wherefore now bid Penelope<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"570\" unit=\"line\"/>to wait in the halls, eager though she be, till set of sun; and then let her ask me of her husband regarding the day of his return, giving me a seat nearer the fire, for lo, the raiment that I wear is mean, and this thou knowest of thyself, for to thee first did I make my prayer.”\n    So he spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"575\" unit=\"line\"/>And as he passed over the threshold Penelope said to him:\n    “Thou dost not bring him, Eumaeus. What does the wanderer mean by this? Does he fear some one beyond measure, or does he idly feel ashamed in the house? 'Tis ill for a beggar to feel shame.”\n    To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"580\" unit=\"line\"/>“He speaks rightly, even as any other man would deem, in seeking to shun the insolence of overweening men. But he bids thee to wait till set of sun. And for thyself, too, it is far more seemly, O queen, to speak to the stranger alone, and to hear his words.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"585\" unit=\"line\"/>Then wise Penelope answered him: “Not without wisdom is the stranger; he divines how it may be. There are no mortal men, methinks, who in wantonness devise such wicked folly as these.”\n    So she spoke, and the goodly swineherd departed<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"590\" unit=\"line\"/>into the throng of the wooers when he had told her all. And straightway he spoke winged words to Telemachus, holding his head close to him that the others might not hear:\n    “Friend, I am going forth to guard the swine and all things there, thy livelihood and mine; but have thou charge of all things here.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"595\" unit=\"line\"/>Thine own self do thou keep safe first of all, and let thy mind beware lest some ill befall thee, for many of the Achaeans are devising evil, whom may Zeus utterly destroy before harm fall on us.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father; go thy way when thou hast supped.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"600\" unit=\"line\"/>And in the morning do thou come and bring goodly victims. But all matters here shall be a care to me and to the immortals.”\n    So he spoke, and the swineherd sat down again on the polished chair. But when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went his way to the swine, and left the courts and the hall<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"605\" unit=\"line\"/>full of banqueters. And they were making merry with dance and song, for evening had now come on.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
