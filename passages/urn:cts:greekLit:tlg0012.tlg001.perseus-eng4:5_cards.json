She made a stream of\n    fire flare from his shield and helmet like the star that shines most\n    brilliantly in summer after its bath in the waters of Okeanos - even such a\n    fire did she kindle upon his head and shoulders as she bade him speed into the\n    thickest uproar of the fight. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"9\" unit=\"line\"/>Now there was a certain rich and honorable man\n    among the Trojans, priest of Hephaistos, and his name was Dares. He had two\n    sons, Phegeus and Idaios, both of them skilled in all the arts of war. These\n    two came forward from the main body of Trojans, and set upon Diomedes, he being\n    on foot, while they fought from their chariot. When they were close up to one\n    another, Phegeus took aim first, but his spear went over Diomedes ‘s left\n    shoulder without hitting him. Diomedes then threw, and his spear sped not in\n    vain, for it hit Phegeus on the breast near the nipple, and he fell from his\n    chariot. Idaios did not dare to bestride his brother's body, but sprang from\n    the chariot and took to flight, or he would have shared his brother's fate; </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"23\" unit=\"line\"/>whereon Hephaistos saved him by wrapping him in\n    a cloud of darkness, that his old father might not be utterly overwhelmed with\n    grief; but the son of Tydeus drove off with the horses, and bade his followers\n    take them to the ships. The Trojans were scared when they saw the two sons of\n    Dares, one of them in fright and the other lying dead by his chariot. Athena,\n    therefore, took Ares by the hand and said, \"Ares, Ares, bane of men,\n    bloodstained stormer of cities, may we not now leave the Trojans and Achaeans\n    to fight it out, and see to which of the two Zeus will grant the victory?

Upon this the Danaans\n    drove the Trojans back, and each one of their chieftains killed his man. First\n    King Agamemnon flung mighty Odios, leader of the Halizonoi, from his chariot.\n    The spear of Agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back, just as he was\n    turning in flight; it struck him between the shoulders and went right through\n    his chest, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the\n    ground. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"43\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Idomeneus killed Phaesus, son of Boros the\n    Meonian, who had come from Varne. Mighty Idomeneus speared him on the right\n    shoulder as he was mounting his chariot, and the darkness of death enshrouded\n    him as he fell heavily from the car. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"48\" unit=\"line\"/>The squires [therapontes] of Idomeneus spoiled\n    him of his armor, while Menelaos, son of Atreus, killed Skamandrios the son of\n    Strophios, a mighty huntsman and keen lover of the chase. Artemis herself had\n    taught him how to kill every kind of wild creature that is bred in mountain\n    forests, but neither she nor his famed skill in archery could now save him, for\n    the spear of Menelaos struck him in the back as he was fleeing; it struck him\n    between the shoulders and went right through his chest, so that he fell\n    headlong and his armor rang rattling round him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"59\" unit=\"line\"/>Meriones then killed Phereklos the son of\n    Tekton, who was the son of Harmon, a man whose hand was skilled in all manner\n    of cunning workmanship, for Pallas Athena had dearly loved him. He it was that\n    made the ships for Alexander, which were the beginning of all mischief, and\n    brought evil alike both on the Trojans and on Alexander himself; for he heeded\n    not the decrees of heaven. Meriones overtook him as he was fleeing, and struck\n    him on the right buttock. The point of the spear went through the bone into the\n    bladder, and death came upon him as he cried aloud and fell forward on his\n    knees. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"69\" unit=\"line\"/>Meges, moreover, slew Pedaios, son of Antenor,\n    who, though he was a bastard, had been brought up by Theano as one of her own\n    children, for the love she bore her husband. The son of Phyleus got close up to\n    him and drove a spear into the nape of his neck: it went under his tongue all\n    among his teeth, so he bit the cold bronze, and fell</p>\n    <p>dead in the dust.</p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"76\" unit=\"line\"/>And Eurypylos, son of Euaemon, killed Hypsenor,\n    the son of noble Dolopion, who had been made priest of the river Skamandros,\n    and was honored in the <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term> as though he were a\n    god. Eurypylos gave him chase as he was fleeing before him, smote him with his\n    sword upon the arm, and lopped his strong hand from off it. The bloody hand\n    fell to the ground, and the shades of death, with fate that no man can\n    withstand, came over his eyes. </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"85\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus furiously did the battle rage between them.\n    As for the son of Tydeus, you could not say whether he was more among the\n    Achaeans or the Trojans. He rushed across the plain like a winter torrent that\n    has burst its barrier in full flood; no dikes, no walls of fruitful vineyards\n    can embank it when it is swollen with rain from heaven, but in a moment it\n    comes tearing onward, and lays many a field waste that many a strong man hand\n    has reclaimed - even so were the dense phalanxes of the Trojans driven in rout\n    by the son of Tydeus, and many though they were, they dared not abide his\n    onslaught. </p>\n    <p> </p>\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"95\" unit=\"line\"/>Now when the son of Lykaon saw him scouring the\n    plain and driving the Trojans pell-mell before him, he aimed an arrow and hit\n    the front part of his cuirass near the shoulder: the arrow went right through\n    the metal and pierced the flesh, so that the cuirass was covered with blood. On\n    this the son of Lykaon shouted in triumph, \"Horsemen Trojans, come on; the\n    bravest of the Achaeans is wounded, and he will not hold out much longer if\n    King Apollo was indeed with me when I sped from <placeName key=\"tgn,7001294\">Lycia</placeName> hither.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"106"},{"n":"106","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"106\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"106\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he vaunt; but his arrow had not killed\n    Diomedes, who withdrew and made for the chariot and horses of Sthenelos, the\n    son of Kapaneus. \"Dear son of Kapaneus,\" said he, \"come down from your chariot,\n    and draw the arrow out of my shoulder.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"111\" unit=\"line\"/>Sthenelos sprang from his chariot, and drew the\n    arrow from the wound, whereon the blood came spouting out through the hole that\n    had been made in his shirt. Then Diomedes prayed, saying, \"Hear me, daughter of\n    aegis-bearing Zeus, unweariable, if ever you loved my father well and stood by\n    him in the thick of a fight, do the like now by me; grant me to come within a\n    spear's throw of that man and kill him.

Then she went\n    up close to him and said, \"Fear not, Diomedes, to do battle with the Trojans,\n    for I have set in your heart the spirit of your father, the horseman Tydeus.\n    Moreover, I have withdrawn the veil from your eyes, that you know gods and men\n    apart.

He was like a lion that some mountain\n    shepherd has wounded, but not killed, as he is springing over the wall of a\n    sheep-yard to attack the sheep. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"139\" unit=\"line\"/>The shepherd has roused the brute to fury but\n    cannot defend his flock, so he takes shelter under cover of the buildings,\n    while the sheep, panic-stricken on being deserted, are smothered in heaps one\n    on top of the other, and the angry lion leaps out over the sheep-yard wall.\n    Even thus did Diomedes go furiously about among the Trojans.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"144\" unit=\"line\"/>He killed Astynoos, and shepherd of his people,\n    the one with a thrust of his spear, which struck him above the nipple, the\n    other with a sword - cut on the collar-bone, that severed his shoulder from his\n    neck and back. He let both of them lie, and went in pursuit of Abas and\n    Polyidos, sons of the old man who read [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>]\n    dreams, Eurydamas: they never came back for him to read them any more dreams,\n    for mighty Diomedes made an end of them. He then gave chase to <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName> and Thoon, the two sons of\n    Phainops, both of them very dear to him, for he was now worn out with age, and\n    begat no more sons to inherit his possessions. But Diomedes took both their\n    lives and left their father sorrowing bitterly, for he nevermore saw them come\n    home from battle alive, and his kinsmen divided his wealth among\n    themselves.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"159\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he came upon two sons of Priam, Echemmon\n    and Chromios, as they were both in one chariot. He sprang upon them as a lion\n    fastens on the neck of some cow or heifer when the herd is feeding in a\n    coppice. For all their vain struggles he flung them both from their chariot and\n    stripped the armor from their bodies. Then he gave their horses to his comrades\n    to take them back to the ships.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"166\" unit=\"line\"/>When Aeneas saw him thus making havoc among the\n    ranks, he went through the fight amid the rain of spears to see if he could\n    find Pandaros.

I know him by his shield, the visor\n    of his helmet, and by his horses. It is possible that he may be a god, but if\n    he is the man I say he is, he is not making all this havoc without heaven's\n    help, but has some god by his side who is shrouded in a cloud of darkness, and\n    who turned my arrow aside when it had hit him. I have taken aim at him already\n    and hit him on the right shoulder; my arrow went through the breastplate of his\n    cuirass; and I made sure I should send him hurrying to the world below, but it\n    seems that I have not killed him. There must be a god who is angry with me.\n    Moreover I have neither horse nor chariot. In my father's stables there are\n    eleven excellent chariots, fresh from the builder, quite new, with cloths\n    spread over them; and by each of them there stand a pair of horses, champing\n    barley and rye; my old father Lykaon urged me again and again when I was at\n    home and on the point of starting, to take chariots and horses with me that I\n    might lead the Trojans in battle, but I would not listen to him; it would have\n    been much better if I had done so, but I was thinking about the horses, which\n    had been used to eat their fill, and I was afraid that in such a great\n    gathering of men they might be ill-fed, so I left them at home and came on foot\n    to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> armed only with my bow and\n    arrows. These it seems, are of no use, for I have already hit two chieftains,\n    the sons of Atreus and of Tydeus, and though I drew blood surely enough, I have\n    only made them still more furious.

Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus, saw them\n    coming and said to Diomedes, \"Diomedes, son of Tydeus, man after my own heart,\n    I see two heroes speeding towards you, both of them men of might the one a\n    skillful archer, Pandaros son of Lykaon, the other, Aeneas, whose sire is\n    Anchises, while his mother is Aphrodite.

They are of the\n    stock that great Zeus gave to Tros in payment for his son Ganymede, and are the\n    finest that live and move under the sun. King Anchises stole the blood by\n    putting his mares to them without Laomedon's knowledge, and they bore him six\n    foals. Four are still in his stables, but he gave the other two to Aeneas.

The horses started aside for fear, and he was reft of\n    life [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] and strength [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">menos</term>]. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"297\" unit=\"line\"/>Aeneas sprang from his chariot armed with\n    shield and spear, fearing lest the Achaeans should carry off the body. He\n    bestrode it as a lion in the pride of strength, with shield and on spear before\n    him and a cry of battle on his lips resolute to kill the first that should dare\n    face him. But the son of Tydeus caught up a mighty stone, so huge and great\n    that as men now are it would take two to lift it; nevertheless he bore it aloft\n    with ease unaided, and with this he struck Aeneas on the groin where the hip\n    turns in the joint that is called the \"cup-bone.\" The stone crushed this joint,\n    and broke both the sinews, while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh. The\n    hero fell on his knees, and propped himself with his hand resting on the ground\n    till the darkness of night fell upon his eyes. And now Aeneas, king of men,\n    would have perished then and there, had not his mother, Zeus' daughter\n    Aphrodite, who had conceived him by Anchises when he was herding cattle, been\n    quick to mark, and thrown her two white arms about the body of her dear son.\n    She protected him by covering him with a fold of her own fair garment, lest\n    some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"318\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus, then, did she bear her dear son out of\n    the fight. But the son of Kapaneus was not unmindful of the orders that\n    Diomedes had given him. He made his own horses fast, away from the struggle, by\n    binding the reins to the rim of the chariot. Then he sprang upon Aeneas' horses\n    and drove them from the Trojan to the Achaean ranks. When he had so done he\n    gave them over to his chosen comrade Deipylos, whom he valued above all others\n    as the one who was most like-minded with himself, to take them on to the ships.\n    He then remounted his own chariot, seized the reins, and drove with all speed\n    in search of the son of Tydeus. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"330\" unit=\"line\"/>Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the\n    Cyprian goddess, spear in hand, for he knew her to be feeble and not one of\n    those goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Athena or Enyo the\n    waster of cities, and when at last after a long chase he caught her up, </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"335\" unit=\"line\"/>he flew at her and thrust his spear into the\n    flesh of her delicate hand.

Aphrodite screamed aloud, and let her son\n    fall, but Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms, and hid him in a cloud of\n    darkness, lest some Danaan should drive a spear into his breast and kill him;\n    and Diomedes shouted out as he left her, \"Daughter of Zeus, leave war and\n    battle alone, can you not be contented with beguiling silly women?

But Athena and Hera, who were looking on, began to taunt Zeus with\n    their mocking talk, and Athena was first to speak. \"Father Zeus,\" said she, \"do\n    not be angry with me, but I think the Cyprian must have been persuading some\n    one of the Achaean women to go with the Trojans of whom she is so very fond,\n    and while caressing one or other of them she must have torn her delicate hand\n    with the gold pin of the woman's brooch.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"426\" unit=\"line\"/>The sire of gods and men smiled, and called\n    golden Aphrodite to his side. \"My child,\" said he, \"it has not been given you\n    to be a warrior.

There,\n    within the mighty sanctuary, Leto and Artemis healed him and made him glorious\n    to behold, while Apollo of the silver bow fashioned a wraith in the likeness of\n    Aeneas, and armed as he was. Round this the Trojans and Achaeans hacked at the\n    bucklers about one another's breasts, hewing each other's round shields and\n    light hide-covered targets. Then Phoebus Apollo said to Ares, \"Ares, Ares, bane\n    of men, blood-stained stormer of cities, can you not go to this man, the son of\n    Tydeus, who would now fight even with father Zeus, and draw him out of the\n    battle?

He sprang from his chariot clad in his suit of armor, and went about\n    among the host brandishing his two spears, exhorting the men to fight and\n    raising the terrible cry of battle. Then they rallied and again faced the\n    Achaeans, but the Argives stood compact and firm, and were not driven back.

Fierce Ares, to\n    help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere\n    among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him that when he saw Pallas,\n    Athena leave the fray he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans -\n    for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from\n    his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with valor, whereon he took his place\n    among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a\n    good courage; but they could not ask him how it had all happened, for they had\n    too much pain [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] with the turmoil raised by\n    Ares and by Strife, who raged insatiably in their midst. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>The two Ajaxes, Odysseus and Diomedes, cheered\n    the Danaans on, fearless of the fury and onset of the Trojans.

The son of Atreus went about\n    among them and exhorted them. \"My friends,\" said he, \"quit yourselves like\n    brave men, and shun dishonor in one another's eyes amid the stress of battle.\n    <milestone n=\"531\" unit=\"line\"/>They that shun dishonor more often live than\n    get killed, but they that flee save neither life nor name [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"533\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he hurled his spear and hit one of\n    those who were in the front rank, the comrade of Aeneas, Deikoön son of\n    Pergasus, whom the Trojans held in no less honor than the sons of Priam, for he\n    was ever quick to place himself among the foremost. The spear of King Agamemnon\n    struck his shield and went right through it, for the shield stayed it not.

As\n    a man crossing a wide plain is dismayed to find himself on the brink of some\n    great river rolling swiftly to the sea - he sees its boiling waters and starts\n    back in fear - even so did the son of Tydeus give ground. Then he said to his\n    men, \"My friends, how can we wonder that Hektor wields the spear so well?

Ajax son of Telamon pitied them in their fall; he came\n    close up and hurled his spear, hitting Amphios the son of Selagus, a man of\n    great wealth who lived in Paesus and owned much grain-growing land, but his lot\n    had led him to come to the aid of Priam and his sons. Ajax struck him in the\n    belt; the spear pierced the lower part of his belly, and he fell heavily to the\n    ground. Then Ajax ran towards him to strip him of his armor, but the Trojans\n    rained spears upon him, many of which fell upon his shield. He planted his heel\n    upon the body and drew out his spear, but the darts pressed so heavily upon him\n    that he could not strip the goodly armor from his shoulders. The Trojan\n    chieftains, moreover, many and valiant, came about him with their spears, so\n    that he dared not stay; great, brave and valiant though he was, they drove him\n    from them and he was beaten back.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"626\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus, then, did the battle rage between them.\n    Presently the strong hand of fate impelled Tlepolemos, the son of Herakles, a\n    man both brave and of great stature, to fight Sarpedon; so the two, son and\n    grandson of great Zeus, drew near to one another, and Tlepolemos spoke first.\n    \"Sarpedon,\" said he, \"councilor of the Lycians, why should you come skulking\n    here you who are a man of peace?

In a second he was on the ground,\n    whereupon the goddess mounted the car and placed herself by the side of\n    Diomedes. The oaken axle groaned aloud under the burden of the awful goddess\n    and the hero; Pallas Athena took the whip and reins, and drove straight at\n    Ares. He was in the act of stripping huge Periphas, son of Ochesios and bravest\n    of the Aetolians. Bloody Ares was stripping him of his armor, and Athena donned\n    the helmet of Hades, that he might not see her; when, therefore, he saw\n    Diomedes, he made straight for him and let Periphas lie where he had fallen. As\n    soon as they were at close quarters he let fly with his bronze spear over the\n    reins and yoke, <milestone n=\"852\" unit=\"line\"/>thinking to take the life of\n    Diomedes, but Athena caught the spear in her hand and made it fly harmlessly\n    over the chariot. Diomedes then threw, and Pallas Athena drove the spear into\n    the pit of Ares' stomach where his under-belt went round him. There Diomedes\n    wounded him, tearing his fair flesh and then drawing his spear out again. Ares\n    roared as loudly as nine or ten thousand men in the thick of a fight, and the\n    Achaeans and Trojans were struck with panic, so terrible was the cry he\n    raised.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"864\" unit=\"line\"/>As a dark cloud in the sky when it comes on to\n    blow after heat, even so did Diomedes son of Tydeus see Ares ascend into the\n    broad heavens. With all speed he reached high <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, home of the gods, and in great pain sat down beside\n    Zeus the son of Kronos. He showed Zeus the immortal blood that was flowing from\n    his wound, and spoke piteously, saying, \"Father Zeus, are you not angered by\n    such doings? We gods are continually suffering in the most cruel manner at one\n    another's hands while doing a favor [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharis</term>] for\n    mortals; and we all owe you a grudge for having begotten that mad termagant of\n    a daughter, who is always committing outrage of some kind. We other gods must\n    all do as you bid us, but her you neither scold nor punish; you encourage her\n    because the pestilent creature is your daughter. See how she has been inciting\n    proud Diomedes to vent his rage on the immortal gods. First he went up to the\n    Cyprian and wounded her in the hand near her wrist, and then he sprang upon me\n    too, equal to a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term>. Had I not run for it I must\n    either have lain there for long enough in torments among the ghastly corpses,\n    or have been eaten alive with spears till I had no more strength left in\n    me.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"888\" unit=\"line\"/>Zeus looked angrily at him and said, \"Do not\n    come whining here, Sir Facing-bothways. I hate you worst of all the gods in\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, for you are ever fighting\n    and making mischief. You have the intolerable and stubborn spirit of your\n    mother Hera: it is all I can do to manage her, and it is her doing that you are\n    now in this plight: <milestone n=\"895\" unit=\"line\"/>still, I cannot let you\n    remain longer in such great pain; you are my own off-spring, and it was by me\n    that your mother conceived you; if, however, you had been the son of any other\n    god, you are so destructive that by this time you should have been lying lower\n    than the Titans.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"899\" unit=\"line\"/>He then bade Paieon heal him, whereon Paieon\n    spread pain-killing herbs upon his wound and cured him, for he was not of\n    mortal mold. As the juice of the fig-tree curdles milk, and thickens it in a\n    moment though it is liquid, even so instantly did Paieon cure fierce Ares. Then\n    Hebe washed him, and clothed him in goodly raiment, and he took his seat by his\n    father Zeus all glorious to behold.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"907\" unit=\"line\"/>But Hera of <placeName key=\"perseus,Argos\">Argos</placeName> and Athena of Alalkomene, now that they had put a stop to\n    the murderous doings of Ares, went back again to the house of Zeus. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
