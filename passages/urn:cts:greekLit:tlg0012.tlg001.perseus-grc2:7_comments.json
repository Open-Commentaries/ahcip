Here in Rhapsody 7, however, the focus shifts to Ajax, who responds to the challenge of Hector to fight in a duel the one hero among all the Achaeans who is truly the ‘best of the Achaeans’. As we know from the overall references to Ajax in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, this hero is considered to be the second-best of the Achaeans in both epics. So, it does not bode well for Hector that, in his duel with Ajax, he cannot succeed beyond fighting such a hero to a draw. If Hector can do no better than fight to a draw the second-best of the Achaeans, he is surely doomed when the time comes for him to face the very best of the Achaeans in Rhapsody 22.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2010EG3723_jpg_l.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>Hector and Ajax separated by heralds, pen and ink drawing by John Flaxman, 1790’s <a href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1009262/hector-and-ajax-separated-by-drawing-flaxman-john/\">Victoria and Albert Museum</a></p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:7.1-7.482","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.069568","title":"Iliad 7.15-7.17","body":"<p>The hero Dexiades is described at I.07.015 by way of the participle <em>epi-almenos</em> meaning ‘one who leaps on’, and the preverb <em>epi</em>- ‘on’ of the participle takes as its object the noun <em>hippoi</em> ‘horses’ in the genitive case.

These elliptic usages compensate, in part, for the fact that the Mycenaean word for ‘chariot’, <em>hikkʷiā</em> (spelled i-qi-ja in the Linear B tablets), is missing in Homeric diction, where it would be pronounced *<em>hippiā</em>. The metrical shape of such a form, long-short-long, would be incompatible with the rhythmical contour of the dactylic hexameter, which generally does not tolerate forms that have such a shape. But the survival of elliptic plural/dual <em>hippoi</em>/<em>hippō</em> is not necessarily a substitution for the missing *<em>hippiā</em>, nor is it justified to assume that such elliptic forms represent some kind of deformity in Homeric diction. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:7.15-7.17","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.069697","title":"Iliad 7.17-61","body":"<p>The divinities Athena and Apollo are not only supporting the Achaeans and the Trojans respectively.

An absence of volunteers, Menelaos knows, would be <em>aklees</em> ‘a thing without glory [<em>kleos</em>]’, I.07.100. It seems of course fitting for him to be the first, since his grievance against the Trojans over the abduction of Helen is primary, but the problem is that all the Achaean chieftains are aware of his inferiority to Hector, I.07.106, and so, fearing for his life, they restrain him from arming himself for a duel. Even the Master Narrator says outright that Hector was superior to Menelaos, I.07.104–105.

It is significant that Nestor’s words refer to these nine chieftains as <em>aristēes Panakhaiōn</em>, I.07.159.

While the Wall is being built, I.07.434–442, the gods are watching, I.07.443–444, and Poseidon makes a speech to Zeus, I.445–453, indicating that this Achaean project is against his will and, presumably, against the will of Apollo. Poseidon is concerned that the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ of the Achaean Wall, I.07.451, will detract from the corresponding glory of the Trojan Wall that had been built by him together with Apollo for Laomedon, who had been king of Troy before Priam, I.07.452–453. Zeus responds with reassurances, I.07.454–464, reaffirming the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ that belongs to Poseidon, I.07.458 (σὸν …κλέος). In other words, Poseidon and Apollo will never lose the epic glory that is theirs because they built the Wall of Troy. And Zeus then utters a prophecy about the <em>teikhos</em> ‘wall’ of the Achaeans, I.07.461: it will be destroyed once the Achaeans leave the Trojan landscape, I.07.459–464. So the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ of the Achaean Wall, as signaled in the wording of Poseidon at I.07.451, will not destroy the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ that is owed to Poseidon and to Apollo for their building of the Trojan Wall. In terms of this formulation made by Zeus, it is not clear whether the Trojan Wall will later be utterly destroyed or simply damaged when the Achaeans finally conquer Troy. Such a distinction is relevant to a claim made in historical times by the inhabitants of New Ilion, which was in fact the Old Ilion, otherwise known simply as Troy: the people of Ilion maintained that their Wall had not been completely destroyed by the Achaeans in the Trojan War and that their city, despite all the destruction, had never been left completely abandoned. This claim is documented but rejected by Strabo 13.1.40 C599. See Point 7 of the anchor comment at I.09.328–333 about efforts of Aeolians to possess ancient Troy and its environs in the historical period.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:7.433-7.465","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Trojan Wall"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achaean Wall"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.282761","title":"Iliad 7.228","body":"<p></p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:7.228","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hēraklēs"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"thūmoleōn ‘having the heart [thūmos] of a lion’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Odysseus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]}]
