This\n    is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now, however, since you are\n    inclined to ask the story of my sorrows, and rekindle my own sad memories in\n    respect of them, I do not know how to begin, nor yet how to continue and\n    conclude my tale, for the hand of heaven has been laid heavily upon me.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"16\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Firstly, then, I will tell you my name that you\n    too may know it, and that one day, if I outlive this time of sorrow, I may\n    become a guest-friend to you, though I live so far away from all of you. I am\n    Odysseus son of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, renowned\n    among humankind for all manner of subtlety, so that my <term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term> ascends to heaven. I live in <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, where there is a high mountain called Neritum, covered\n    with forests; and not far from it there is a group of islands very near to one\n    another - Dulichium, Same, and the wooded island of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011374\">Zacynthus</placeName>. It lies squat on the horizon, all\n    highest up in the sea towards the sunset, while the others lie away from it\n    towards dawn. It is a rugged island, but it breeds brave men, and my eyes know\n    none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso kept me with her\n    in her cave, and wanted me to marry her, as did also the cunning Aeaean goddess\n    Circe; but they could neither of them persuade me, for there is nothing dearer\n    to a man than his own country and his parents, and however splendid a home he\n    may have in a foreign country, if it be far from father or mother, he does not\n    care about it. Now, however, I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures\n    which by Zeus’ will I met with on my return [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>] from <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"39\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When I had set sail thence the wind took me\n    first to Ismaros, which is the city of the Kikones. There I sacked the town and\n    put the people to the sword. We took their wives and also much booty, which we\n    divided equitably amongst us, so that none might have reason to complain. I\n    then said that we had better make off at once, but my men very foolishly would\n    not obey me, so they stayed there drinking much wine and killing great numbers\n    of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the Kikones cried out for help to\n    other Kikones who lived inland. These were more in number, and stronger, and\n    they were more skilled in the art of war, for they could fight, either from\n    chariots or on foot as the occasion served; in the morning, therefore, they\n    came as thick as leaves and bloom in summertime [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôra</term>], and the hand of heaven was against us, so that we were hard\n    pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships, and the hosts aimed their\n    bronze-shod spears at one another. So long as the day waxed and it was still\n    morning, we held our own against them, though they were more in number than we;\n    but as the sun went down, towards the time when men loose their oxen, the\n    Kikones got the better of us, and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we\n    had; so we got away with those that were left.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"62\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thence we sailed onward with sorrow in our\n    hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we had lost our comrades, nor did\n    we leave till we had thrice invoked each one of the poor men who had perished\n    by the hands of the Kikones. Then Zeus raised the North wind against us till it\n    blew a blast of wind, so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds, and\n    night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the gale,\n    but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters, so we took them down for\n    fear of shipwreck, and rowed our hardest towards the land. There we lay two\n    days and two nights suffering much alike from toil and distress of mind, but on\n    the morning of the third day we again raised our masts, set sail, and took our\n    places, letting the wind and steersmen direct our ship.

Here we\n    landed to take in fresh water, and our crews got their mid-day meal on the\n    shore near the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I chose [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] two of my company to go see what manner of men\n    the people of the place might be, and they had a third man under them. They\n    started at once, and went about among the Lotus-eaters, who did them no harm,\n    but gave them to eat of the lotus, which was so delicious that those who ate of\n    it left off caring about home, and did not even want to go back and say what\n    had happened to them, but were for staying and munching lotus with the\n    Lotus-eaters without thinking further of their <term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>; nevertheless, though they wept bitterly I forced them back\n    to the ships and made them fast under the benches. Then I told the rest to go\n    on board at once, lest any of them should taste of the lotus and leave off\n    wanting to achieve a homecoming [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>], so they\n    took their places and smote the gray sea with their oars.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>\"We sailed hence, always in much distress, till\n    we came to the land of the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes\n    neither plant nor plough, but trust in providence, and live on such wheat,\n    barley, and grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage, and their wild\n    grapes yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no laws\n    nor assemblies of the people, but live in caves on the tops of high mountains;\n    each is lord and master in his family, and they take no account of their\n    neighbors.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"116\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Now off their harbor there lies a wooded and\n    fertile island not quite close to the land of the Cyclopes, but still not far.\n    It is overrun with wild goats, that breed there in great numbers and are never\n    disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen - who as a rule will suffer so much\n    hardship in forest or among mountain precipices - do not go there, nor yet\n    again is it ever ploughed or fed down, but it lies a wilderness untilled and\n    unsown from year to year, and has no living thing upon it but only goats. For\n    the Cyclopes have no ships, nor yet shipwrights who could make ships for them;\n    they cannot therefore go from city to city, or sail over the sea to one\n    another's country as people who have ships can do; if they had had these they\n    would have colonized the island, for it is a very good one, and would yield\n    everything in due season. There are meadows that in some places come right down\n    to the sea shore, well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do\n    there excellently; there is level land for ploughing, and it would always yield\n    heavily at harvest time [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôra</term>], for the soil is\n    deep. There is a good harbor where no cables are wanted, nor yet anchors, nor\n    need a ship be moored, but all one has to do is to beach one's vessel and stay\n    there till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of\n    the harbor there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave, and there are\n    poplars growing all round it.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"142\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Here we entered, but so dark was the night\n    that some god must have brought us in, for there was nothing whatever to be\n    seen.

On this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships, and\n    dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven sent us\n    excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me, and each ship got nine goats,\n    while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to the going down of\n    the sun we ate and drank our fill, - and we had plenty of wine left, for each\n    one of us had taken many jars full when we sacked the city of the Kikones, and\n    this had not yet run out. While we were feasting we kept turning our eyes\n    towards the land of the Cyclopes, which was hard by, and saw the smoke of their\n    stubble fires. We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of\n    their sheep and goats, but when the sun went down and it came on dark, we\n    camped down upon the beach, and next morning I called a council.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"172\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Stay here, my brave men,’ said I, ‘all the\n    rest of you, while I go with my ship and make trial of these people myself: I\n    want to see if they are uncivilized [not <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dikaios</term>]\n    savages, or a race hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing <term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"177\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I went on board, bidding my men to do so also\n    and loose the hawsers; so they took their places and smote the gray sea with\n    their oars. When we got to the land, which was not far, there, on the face of a\n    cliff near the sea, we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a station\n    for a great many sheep and goats, and outside there was a large yard, with a\n    high wall round it made of stones built into the ground and of trees both pine\n    and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster who was then away from home\n    shepherding his flocks. He would have nothing to do with other people, but led\n    the life of an outlaw. He was a horrid creature, not like a human being at all,\n    but resembling rather some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the\n    top of a high mountain.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"193\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I told my men to draw the ship ashore, and\n    stay where they were, all but the twelve best [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krînô</term>] among them, who were to go along with myself. I also took a\n    goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by Maron, Apollo son of\n    Euanthes, who was priest of Apollo the patron god of Ismaros, and lived within\n    the wooded precincts of the temple. When we were sacking the city we respected\n    him, and spared his life, as also his wife and child; so he made me some\n    presents of great value - seven talents of fine gold, and a bowl of silver,\n    with twelve jars of sweet wine, unblended, and of the most exquisite flavor.\n    Not a man nor maid in the house knew about it, but only himself, his wife, and\n    one housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of\n    wine, and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that it was\n    impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with this wine, and\n    took a wallet full of provisions with me, for my mind misgave me that I might\n    have to deal with some savage who would be of great strength, and would respect\n    neither right [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dikê</term>] nor law.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"216"},{"n":"216","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"216\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"216\" unit=\"line\"/>\"We soon reached his cave, but he was out\n    shepherding, so we went inside and took stock of all that we could see. His\n    cheese-racks were loaded with cheeses, and he had more lambs and kids than his\n    pens could hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the\n    hoggets, then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones\n    all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy, all the vessels, bowls, and\n    milk pails into which he milked, were swimming with whey. When they saw all\n    this, my men begged me to let them first steal some cheeses, and make off with\n    them to the ship; they would then return, drive down the lambs and kids, put\n    them on board and sail away with them. It would have been indeed better if we\n    had done so but I would not listen to them, for I wanted to see the owner\n    himself, in the hope that he might give me a present. When, however, we saw him\n    my poor men found him ill to deal with.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"231\" unit=\"line\"/>\"We lit a fire, offered some of the cheeses in\n    sacrifice, ate others of them, and then sat waiting till the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> should come in with his sheep. When he\n    came, he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood to light the fire for\n    his supper, and this he flung with such a noise on to the floor of his cave\n    that we hid ourselves for fear at the far end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove\n    all the ewes inside, as well as the she-goats that he was going to milk,\n    leaving the males, both rams and he-goats, outside in the yards. Then he rolled\n    a huge stone to the mouth of the cave - so huge that two and twenty strong\n    four-wheeled wagons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the\n    doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats, all in\n    due course, and then let each of them have her own young. He curdled half the\n    milk and set it aside in wicker strainers, but the other half he poured into\n    bowls that he might drink it for his supper. When he had got through with all\n    his work, he lit the fire, and then caught sight of us, whereon he said:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"252\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Strangers, who are you?

I shall not spare either yourself or your companions out of\n    any regard for Zeus, unless I am in the humor for doing so. And now tell me\n    where you made your ship fast when you came on shore. Was it round the point,\n    or is she lying straight off the land?’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"281\" unit=\"line\"/>\"He said this to draw me out, but I was too\n    cunning to be caught in that way, so I answered with a lie; ‘Poseidon,’ said I,\n    ‘sent my ship on to the rocks at the far end of your country, and wrecked it.\n    We were driven on to them from the open sea, but I and those who are with me\n    escaped the jaws of death.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"287\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The cruel wretch granted me not one word of\n    answer, but with a sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed\n    them down upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were\n    shed upon the ground, and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore them\n    limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a lion in the\n    wilderness, flesh, bones, marrow, and entrails, without leaving anything\n    uneaten. As for us, we wept and lifted up our hands to heaven on seeing such a\n    horrid sight, for we did not know what else to do; but when the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> had filled his huge paunch, and had\n    washed down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk, he stretched\n    himself full length upon the ground among his sheep, and went to sleep. I was\n    at first inclined to seize my sword, draw it, and drive it into his vitals, but\n    I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be lost, for we should never\n    be able to shift the stone which the monster had put in front of the door.

Presently, with the utmost ease, he rolled the stone away from\n    the door and drove out his sheep, but he at once put it back again - as easily\n    as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a quiver full of arrows. As\n    soon as he had done so he shouted, and cried ‘Shoo, shoo,’ after his sheep to\n    drive them on to the mountain; so I was left to scheme some way of taking my\n    revenge and covering myself with glory.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"318"},{"n":"318","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"318\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"318\" unit=\"line\"/>\"In the end I deemed it would be the best plan\n    to do as follows. The <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> had a\n    great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it was of green olive\n    wood, and he had cut it intending to use it for a staff as soon as it should be\n    dry. It was so huge that we could only compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared\n    merchant vessel of large burden, and able to venture out into open sea. I went\n    up to this club and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the\n    men and told them to fine it evenly off at one end, which they proceeded to do,\n    and lastly I brought it to a point myself, charring the end in the fire to make\n    it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung, which was lying about all\n    over the cave, and told the men to cast lots which of them should venture along\n    with myself to lift it and bore it into the monster's eye while he was asleep.\n    The lot fell upon the very four whom I should have chosen, and I myself made\n    five. In the evening the wretch came back from shepherding, and drove his\n    flocks into the cave - this time driving them all inside, and not leaving any\n    in the yards; I suppose some fancy must have taken him, or a god must have\n    prompted him to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place\n    against the door, he sat down, milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly,\n    and then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all this\n    work, he gripped up two more of my men, and made his supper off them. So I went\n    up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my hands:</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"347\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Look here, <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>,’ said I, 'you have been eating a great deal of man's\n    flesh, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor\n    we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a drink-offering, in the\n    hope that you would take compassion upon me and further me on my way home,\n    whereas all you do is to go on ramping and raving most intolerably.

He was so\n    delighted with the taste of the wine that he begged me for another bowl full.\n    ‘Be so kind,’ he said, ‘as to give me some more, and tell me your name at once.\n    I want to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even\n    in this country, for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them, but this\n    drinks like nectar and ambrosia all in one.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"360\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I then gave him some more; three times did I\n    fill the bowl for him, and three times did he drain it without thought or heed;\n    then, when I saw that the wine had got into his head, I said to him as\n    plausibly as I could: ‘<placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, you\n    ask my name and I will tell it you; give me, therefore, the present you\n    promised me; my name is Noman; this is what my father and mother and my friends\n    have always called me.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"368"},{"n":"368","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"368\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"368\" unit=\"line\"/>\"But the cruel wretch said, ‘Then I will eat\n    all Noman's comrades before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last.\n    This is the present that I will make him.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"371\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he reeled, and fell sprawling face\n    upwards on the ground. His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep\n    took hold upon him. Presently he turned sick, and threw up both wine and the\n    gobbets of human flesh on which he had been gorging, for he was very drunk.\n    Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it, and encouraged\n    my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the wood, green though\n    it was, was about to blaze, I drew it out of the fire glowing with heat, and my\n    men gathered round me, for a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> had filled\n    their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam into the\n    monster's eye, and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept turning it round\n    and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship's plank with an auger, which\n    two men with a wheel and strap can keep on turning as long as they choose. Even\n    thus did we bore the red hot beam into his eye, till the boiling blood bubbled\n    all over it as we worked it round and round, so that the steam from the burning\n    eyeball scalded his eyelids and eyebrows, and the roots of the eye sputtered in\n    the fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to temper\n    it - for it is this that gives strength to the iron - and it makes a great hiss\n    as he does so, even thus did the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>’ eye hiss round the beam of olive wood, and his hideous\n    yells made the cave ring again. We ran away in a fright, but he plucked the\n    beam all besmirched with gore from his eye, and hurled it from him in a frenzy\n    of rage and pain, shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the\n    bleak headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave\n    when they heard him crying, and asked what was the matter with him.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"403\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘What ails you, Polyphemus,’ said they, ‘that\n    you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, and preventing us\n    from being able to sleep?

In the end I deemed that this plan\n    would be the best. The male sheep were well grown, and carried a heavy black\n    fleece, so I bound them noiselessly in threes together, with some of the\n    withies on which the wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under\n    the middle sheep, and the two on either side were to cover him, so that there\n    were three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any of\n    the others, so I caught hold of him by the back, ensconced myself in the thick\n    wool under his belly, and hung on patiently to his fleece, face upwards,\n    keeping a firm hold on it all the time.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"436\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus, then, did we wait in great fear of mind\n    till morning came, but when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared,\n    the male sheep hurried out to feed, while the ewes remained bleating about the\n    pens waiting to be milked, for their udders were full to bursting; but their\n    master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they stood\n    upright, without being sharp enough to find out that the men were underneath\n    their bellies. As the ram was going out, last of all, heavy with its fleece and\n    with the weight of my crafty self; Polyphemus laid hold of it and said:</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"447"},{"n":"447","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"447\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"447\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘My good ram, what is it that makes you the\n    last to leave my cave this morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before\n    you, but lead the mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain,\n    and are the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is\n    it because you know your master has lost his eye, and are sorry because that\n    wicked Noman and his horrid crew have got him down in his drink and blinded\n    him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and talk, you would\n    tell me where the wretch is hiding, and I would dash his brains upon the ground\n    till they flew all over the cave. I should thus have some satisfaction for the\n    harm this no-good Noman has done me.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"461\" unit=\"line\"/>\"As spoke he drove the ram outside, but when we\n    were a little way out from the cave and yards, I first got from under the ram's\n    belly, and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep, which were very fat, by\n    constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them down to\n    the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who had escaped\n    death, but wept for the others whom the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> had killed. However, I made signs to them by nodding\n    and frowning that they were to hush their crying, and told them to get all the\n    sheep on board at once and put out to sea; so they went aboard, took their\n    places, and smote the gray sea with their oars. Then, when I had got as far out\n    as my voice would reach, I began to jeer at the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘<placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>,’ said I, ‘you should have taken better measure of your\n    man before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch, do you intend by\n    violence [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>] to eat up your visitors in your own\n    cave? You might have known that your derangement would find you out, and now\n    Zeus and the other gods have punished you.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>\"He got more and more furious as he heard me,\n    so he tore the top from off a high mountain, and flung it just in front of my\n    ship so that it was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea\n    quaked as the rock fell into it, and the wash of the wave it raised carried us\n    back towards the mainland, and forced us towards the shore. But I snatched up a\n    long pole and kept the ship off, making signs to my men by nodding my head,\n    that they must row for their lives, whereon they laid out with a will. When we\n    had got twice as far as we were before, I was for jeering at the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> again, but the men begged and prayed\n    of me to hold my tongue.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"494"},{"n":"494","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"494\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"494\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘Do not,’ they exclaimed, ‘be mad enough to\n    provoke this savage creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already\n    which drove us back again to the mainland, and we made sure it had been the\n    death of us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have\n    pounded our heads and our ship's timbers into a jelly with the rugged rocks he\n    would have heaved at us, for he can throw them a long way.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>\"But I would not listen to them, and shouted\n    out to him in my rage, ‘<placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, if\n    any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and spoiled your beauty, say\n    it was the valiant warrior Odysseus, son of Laertes, who lives in <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"506\" unit=\"line\"/>\"On this he groaned, and cried out, ‘Alas,\n    alas, then the old prophecy about me is coming true. There was a seer [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mantis</term>] here, at one time, a man both brave and of\n    great stature, Telemos son of Eurymos, who was an excellent seer, and did all\n    the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he grew old; he told me that all this\n    would happen to me some day, and said I should lose my sight by the hand of\n    Odysseus. I have been all along expecting some one of imposing presence and\n    superhuman strength, whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant\n    weakling, who has managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my\n    drink; come here, then, Odysseus, that I may make you presents to show my\n    hospitality, and urge Poseidon to help you forward on your journey - for\n    Poseidon and I are father and son. He, if he so will, shall heal me, which no\n    one else neither god nor man can do.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"522\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Then I said, ‘I wish I could be as sure of\n    killing you outright and sending you down, bereft of your <term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>, to the house of Hades, as I am that it will take more than\n    Poseidon to cure that eye of yours.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"526"},{"n":"526","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"526\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"526\" unit=\"line\"/>\"On this he lifted up his hands to the\n    firmament of heaven and prayed, saying, ‘Hear me, great Poseidon; if I am\n    indeed your own true-begotten son, grant that Odysseus may never reach his home\n    alive; or if he must get back to his friends at last, let him do so late and in\n    sore plight after losing all his men let him reach his home in another man's\n    ship and find trouble in his house.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"536\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus did he pray, and Poseidon heard his\n    prayer. Then he picked up a rock much larger than the first, swung it aloft and\n    hurled it with prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship, but was within\n    a little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock fell into\n    it, and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on our way towards the\n    shore of the island.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"543\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When at last we got to the island where we had\n    left the rest of our ships, we found our comrades lamenting us, and anxiously\n    awaiting our return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to\n    the sea shore; we also landed the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>’ sheep, and divided them equitably amongst us so that\n    none might have reason to complain. As for the ram, my companions agreed that I\n    should have it as an extra share; so I sacrificed it on the sea shore, and\n    burned its thigh bones to Zeus, who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my\n    sacrifice, and only thought how he might destroy my ships and my comrades.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"556\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus through the livelong day to the going\n    down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and drink, but when the sun went\n    down and it came on dark, we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning,\n    rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers.\n    Then they took their places and smote the gray sea with their oars; so we\n    sailed on with sorrow in our hearts, but glad to have escaped death though we\n    had lost our comrades. <milestone n=\"566\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
