And goodly Odysseus noted the fawning of the hounds, and the sound of footsteps fell upon his ears; and straightway he spoke to Eumaeus winged words:\n    “Eumaeus, surely some comrade of thine will be coming, or at least some one thou knowest, for the hounds do not bark,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>but fawn about him, and I hear the sound of footsteps.”\n    Not yet was the word fully uttered, when his own dear son stood in the doorway.

And he went to meet his lord,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes and his two hands, and a big tear fell from him. And as a loving father greets his own dear son, who comes in the tenth year from a distant land—his only son and well-beloved, for whose sake he has borne much sorrow—<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"20\" unit=\"line\"/>even so did the goodly swineherd then clasp in his arms godlike Telemachus, and kiss him all over as one escaped from death; and with wailing he addressed him with winged words: \n    “Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes.

As he drew near, his father, Odysseus, rose from his seat and gave him place, but Telemachus on his part checked him, and said:\n    “Be seated, stranger, and we shall find a seat elsewhere<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"45\" unit=\"line\"/>in our farmstead.

Then the swineherd set before them platters<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"50\" unit=\"line\"/>of roast meats, which they had left at their meal the day before, and quickly heaped up bread in baskets, and mixed in a bowl of ivy wood honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against divine Odysseus. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, Telemachus spoke to the goodly swineherd, and said:\n    “Father, from whence did this stranger come to thee?

Neither do the people at large bear me any grudge or hatred,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"115\" unit=\"line\"/>nor have I cause to blame brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts, even if a great strife arise. For in this wise has the son of Cronos made our house to run in but a single line.

But now, from the day when thou wentest in thy ship to <placeName key=\"perseus,Pylos\">Pylos</placeName>, they say he has no more eaten and drunk as before, nor overseen the fields, but with groaning and wailing<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>he sits and weeps, and the flesh wastes from off his bones.”\n    Then wise Telemachus answered him: “'Tis the sadder; but none the less we will let him be, despite our sorrow; for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing, we should choose first of all the day of my father's return.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>No, do thou come back, when thou hast given thy message, and wander not over the fields in search of Laertes; but did my mother with all speed send forth her handmaid, the housewife, secretly, for she might bear word to the old man.”\n    With this he roused the swineherd, and he took his sandals in his hands<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>and bound them beneath his feet and went forth to the city. Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead, but she drew near in the likeness of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork. And she stood over against the door of the hut, shewing herself to Odysseus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>but Telemachus did not see her before him, or notice her; for in no wise do the gods appear in manifest presence to all. But Odysseus saw her, and the hounds, and they barked not, but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead. The she made a sign with her brows, and goodly Odysseus perceived it,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"165\" unit=\"line\"/>and went forth from the hall, past the great wall of the court, and stood before her, and Athena spoke to him, saying:\n    “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"170\" unit=\"line\"/>you may go to the famous city. Nor will I myself be long away from you, for I am eager for the battle.”\n    With this, Athena touched him with her golden wand.

Then, when she had wrought thus, she departed, but Odysseus went into the hut.

For nowise could a mortal man contrive this by his own wit, unless a god were himself to come to him, and easily by his will make him young or old. For verily but now thou wast an old man and meanly clad,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>whereas now thou art like the gods, who hold broad heaven.”\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Telemachus, it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house, or to be amazed. For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>but I here, I, even such as thou seest me, after sufferings and many wanderings, am come in the twentieth year to my native land.

Easy it is for the gods, who hold broad heaven, both to glorify a mortal man and to abase him.”\n    So saying, he sat down, and Telemachus, flinging his arms about his noble father, wept and shed tears,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>and in the hearts of both arose a longing for lamentation. And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds, sea-eagles, or vultures with crooked talons, whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged; even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>And now would the light of the sun have gone down upon their weeping, had not Telemachus spoken to his father suddenly:\n    “In what manner of ship, dear father, have sailors now brought thee hither to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>?

But when the fair lady reached the wooers,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall, holding before her face her shining veil; and she rebuked Antinous, and spoke, and addressed him:\n    “Antinous, full of insolence, deviser of evil! and yet it is thou, men say, that dost excel among all of thy years in the land of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>in counsel and in speech. But thou, it seems, art not such a man. Madman! why dost thou devise death and fate for Telemachus, and carest not for suppliants, for whom Zeus is witness. 'Tis an impious thing to plot evil one against another. Dost thou not know of the time when thy father came to this house a fugitive<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>in terror of the people? For of a truth they were greatly wroth with him because he had joined Taphian pirates and harried the Thesprotians, who were in league with us. Him, then, they were minded to slay, and take from him his life by violence, and utterly to devour his great and pleasant livelihood;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>but Odysseus held them back, and stayed them despite their eagerness. His house it is that thou consumest now without atonement, and wooest his wife, and seekest to slay his son, and on me thou bringest great distress. Nay, forbear, I charge thee, and bid the rest forbear.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"434"},{"n":"434","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"434\">\n    <p>\n    Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered her:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>“Daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, be of good cheer, and let not things distress thy heart. That man lives not, nor shall live, nor shall ever be born, who shall lay hands upon thy son Telemachus while I live and behold the light upon the earth.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>For thus will I speak out to thee, and verily it shall be brought to pass. Quickly shall that man's black blood flow forth about my spear; for of a truth me, too, did Odysseus the sacker of cities often set upon his knees, and put roast meat in my hands, and hold to my lips red wine.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>Therefore Telemachus is far the dearest of all men to me, and I bid him have no fear of death, at least from the wooers; but from the gods can no man avoid it.”\n    Thus he spoke to cheer her, but against that son he was himself plotting death. So she went up to her bright upper chamber<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.\n    But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son, and they were busily making ready their supper, and had slain a boar of a year old. Then Athena<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>came close to Odysseus, son of Laertes, and smote him with her wand, and again made him an old man; and mean raiment she put about his body, lest the swineherd might look upon him and know him, and might go to bear tidings to constant Penelope, and not hold the secret fast in his heart.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>Now Telemachus spoke first to the swineherd, and said: “Thou hast come, goodly Eumaeus. What news is there in the city? Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?”\n    To him, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>“I was not minded to go about the city, asking and enquiring of this; my heart bade me with all speed to come back hither when I had given my message. But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions, a herald, who was the first to tell the news to thy mother.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>And this further thing I know, for I saw it with my eyes. I was now above the city, as I went on my way, where the hill of Hermes is, when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor, and there were many men in her, and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>And I thought it was they, but I have no knowledge.”\n    So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father, but shunned the swineherd's eye.\n    And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they fell to feasting, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, they bethought them of rest, and took the gift of sleep.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
