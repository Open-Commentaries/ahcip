And Alcinous again answered him, and said:\n    “Odysseus, since thou hast come to my<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"5\" unit=\"line\"/>high-roofed house with floor of brass, thou shalt not, methinks, be driven back, and return with baffled purpose, even though thou hast suffered much. And to each man of you that in my halls are ever wont to drink the flaming wine of the elders, and to listen to the minstrel, I speak, and give this charge.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>Raiment for the stranger lies already stored in the polished chest, with gold curiously wrought and all the other gifts which the counsellors of the Phaeacians brought hither. But, come now, let us give him a great tripod and a cauldron, each man of us, and we in turn will gather the cost from among the people,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>and repay ourselves. It were hard for one man to give freely, without requital.”\n    So spake Alcinous, and his word was pleasing to them. They then went, each man to his house, to take their rest; but as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they hastened to the ship and brought the bronze, that gives strength to men.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"20\" unit=\"line\"/>And the strong and mighty Alcinous went himself throughout the ship, and carefully stowed the gifts beneath the benches, that they might not hinder any of the crew at their rowing, when they busily plied the oars. Then they went to the house of Alcinous, and prepared a feast.\n    And for them the strong and mighty Alcinous sacrificed a bull<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all. Then, when they had burned the thigh-pieces, they feasted a glorious feast, and made merry, and among them the divine minstrel Demodocus, held in honor by the people, sang to the lyre. But Odysseus would ever turn his head toward the blazing sun,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>eager to see it set, for verily he was eager to return home. And as a man longs for supper, for whom all day long a yoke of wine-dark oxen has drawn the jointed plough through fallow land, and gladly for him does the light of the sun sink, that he may busy him with his supper, and his knees grow weary as he goes;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"35\" unit=\"line\"/>even so gladly for Odysseus did the light of the sun sink. Straightway then he spoke among the Phaeacians, lovers of the oar, and to Alcinous above all he declared his word, and said:\n    “Lord Alcinous, renowned above all men, pour libations now, and send ye me on my way in peace; and yourselves too—Farewell!<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"40\" unit=\"line\"/>For now all that my heart desired has been brought to pass: a convoy, and gifts of friendship. May the gods of heaven bless them to me, and on my return may I find in my home my peerless wife with those I love unscathed; and may you again, remaining here, make glad<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"45\" unit=\"line\"/>your wedded wives and children; and may the gods grant you prosperity of every sort, and may no evil come upon your people.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"47"},{"n":"47","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"47\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade send the stranger on his way, since he had spoken fittingly. Then the mighty Alcinous spoke to the herald, saying:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"50\" unit=\"line\"/>“Pontonous, mix the bowl, and serve out wine to all in the hall, in order that, when we have made prayer to father Zeus, we may send forth the stranger to his own native land.”\n    So he spoke, and Pontonous mixed the honey hearted wine and served out to all, coming up to each in turn;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>and they poured libations to the blessed gods, who hold broad heaven, from where they sat. But goodly Odysseus arose, and placed in the hand of Arete the two-handled cup, and spoke, and addressed her with winged words:\n    “Fare thee well, O queen, throughout all the years, till old age<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"60\" unit=\"line\"/>and death come, which are the lot of mortals. As for me, I go my way, but do thou in this house have joy of thy children and thy people and Alcinous the king.”\n    So the goodly Odysseus spake and passed over the threshold. And with him the mighty Alcinous sent forth a herald<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"65\" unit=\"line\"/>to lead him to the swift ship and the shore of the sea. And Arete sent with him slave women, one bearing a newly washed cloak and a tunic, and another again she bade follow to bear the strong chest, and yet another bore bread and red wine.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"70\" unit=\"line\"/>But when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, straightway the lordly youths that were his escort took these things, and stowed them in the hollow ship, even all the food and drink. Then for Odysseus they spread a rug and a linen sheet on the deck of the hollow ship<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"75\" unit=\"line\"/>at the stern, that he might sleep soundly; and he too went aboard, and laid him down in silence. Then they sat down on the benches, each in order, and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone. And as soon as they leaned back, and tossed the brine with their oarblades, sweet sleep fell upon his eyelids,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"80\" unit=\"line\"/>an unawakening sleep, most sweet, and most like to death. And as on a plain four yoked stallions spring forward all together beneath the strokes of the lash, and leaping on high swiftly accomplish their way, even so the stern of that ship leapt on high, and in her wake<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"85\" unit=\"line\"/>the dark wave of the loud-sounding sea foamed mightily, and she sped safely and surely on her way; not even the circling hawk, the swiftest of winged things, could have kept pace with her. Thus she sped on swiftly and clove the waves of the sea, bearing a man the peer of the gods in counsel,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"90\" unit=\"line\"/>one who in time past had suffered many griefs at heart in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves; but now he slept in peace, forgetful of all that he had suffered.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"93"},{"n":"93","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"93\">\n    <p>\n    Now when that brightest of stars rose which ever comes to herald the light of early Dawn,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"95\" unit=\"line\"/>even then the seafaring ship drew near to the island.\n    There is in the land of <placeName key=\"tgn,7013803\">Ithaca</placeName> a certain harbor of Phorcys, the old man of the sea, and at its mouth two projecting headlands sheer to seaward, but sloping down on the side toward the harbor. These keep back the great waves raised by heavy winds<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"100\" unit=\"line\"/>without, but within the benched ships lie unmoored when they have reached the point of anchorage. At the head of the harbor is a long-leafed olive tree, and near it a pleasant, shadowy cave sacred to the nymphs that are called Naiads.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>Therein are mixing bowls and jars of stone, and there too the bees store honey.

Then they stepped forth from the benched ship upon the land, and first they lifted Odysseus out of the hollow ship, with the linen sheet and bright rug as they were, and laid him down on the sand, still overpowered by sleep.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"120\" unit=\"line\"/>And they lifted out the goods which the lordly Phaeacians had given him, as he set out for home, through the favour of great-hearted Athena. These they set all together by the trunk of the olive tree, out of the path, lest haply some wayfarer, before Odysseus awoke, might come upon them and spoil them.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>Then they themselves returned home again. But the Shaker of the Earth did not forget the threats wherewith at the first he had threatened godlike Odysseus, and he thus enquired of the purpose of Zeus:\n    “Father Zeus, no longer shall I, even I, be held in honor among the immortal gods, seeing that mortals honor me not a whit—<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"130\" unit=\"line\"/>even the Phaeacians, who, thou knowest, are of my own lineage. For I but now declared that Odysseus should suffer many woes ere he reached his home, though I did not wholly rob him of his return when once thou hadst promised it and confirmed it with thy nod; yet in his sleep these men have borne him in a swift ship over the sea<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"135\" unit=\"line\"/>and set him down in <placeName key=\"tgn,7013803\">Ithaca</placeName>, and have given him gifts past telling, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from <placeName key=\"tgn,7014164\">Troy</placeName>, if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"139"},{"n":"139","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"139\">\n    <p>\n    Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him, and said:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>“Ah me, thou shaker of the earth, wide of sway, what a thing hast thou said! The gods do thee no dishonor; hard indeed would it be to assail with dishonor our eldest and best. But as for men, if any one, yielding to his might and strength, fails to do thee honor in aught, thou mayest ever take vengeance, even thereafter.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>Do as thou wilt, and as is thy good pleasure.”\n    Then Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him: “Straightway should I have done as thou sayest, thou god of the dark clouds, but I ever dread and avoid thy wrath. But now I am minded to smite the fair ship of the Phaeacians,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>as she comes back from his convoy on the misty deep, that hereafter they may desist and cease from giving convoy to men, and to fling a great mountain about their city.”\n    Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said: “Lazy one, hear what seems best in my sight.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>When all the people are looking forth from the city upon her as she speeds on her way, then do thou turn her to stone hard by the land—a stone in the shape of a swift ship, that all men may marvel; and do thou fling a great mountain about their city.”\n    Now when Poseidon, the earth-shaker, heard this<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>he went his way to <placeName key=\"tgn,7010886\">Scheria</placeName>, where the Phaeacians dwell, and there he waited. And she drew close to shore, the seafaring ship, speeding swiftly on her way. Then near her came the Earth-shaker and turned her to stone, and rooted her fast beneath by a blow of the flat of his hand, and then he was gone.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"165\" unit=\"line\"/>But they spoke winged words to one another, the Phaeacians of the long oars, men famed for their ships.

Lo, she was in plain sight.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"170\" unit=\"line\"/>So would one of them speak, but they knew not how these things were to be. Then Alcinous addressed their company and said:\n    “Lo now, verily the oracles of my father, uttered long ago, have come upon me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>He said that some day, as a beautiful ship of the Phaeacians was returning from a convoy over the misty deep, Poseidon would smite her, and would fling a great mountain about our town.

But now come, as I bid let us all obey.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"180\" unit=\"line\"/>Cease ye to give convoy to mortals, when anyone comes to our city, and let us sacrifice to Poseidon twelve choice bulls, if haply he may take pity, and not fling a lofty mountain about our town.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"184"},{"n":"184","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"184\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and they were seized with fear and made ready the bulls.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"185\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus they were praying to the lord Poseidon, the leaders and counsellors of the land of the Phaeacians, as they stood about the altar, but Odysseus awoke out of his sleep in his native land. Yet he knew it not after his long absence, for about him the goddess had shed a mist,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"190\" unit=\"line\"/>even Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, that she might render him unknown, and tell him all things, so that his wife might not know him, nor his townsfolk, nor his friends, until the wooers had paid the full price of all their transgressions. Therefore all things seemed strange to their lord,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"195\" unit=\"line\"/>the long paths, the bays offering safe anchorage, the sheer cliffs, and the luxuriant trees. So he sprang up and stood and looked upon his native land, and then he groaned and smote both of his thighs with the flat of his hands, and mournfully spoke, and said:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>“Woe is me, to the land of what mortals am I now come? Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust, or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? Whither shall I bear all this wealth, or whither shall I myself go wandering on?

But now I know not where to bestow this wealth; yet here will I not leave it, lest haply it become the spoil of others to my cost. Out upon them; not wholly wise, it seems, nor just<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"210\" unit=\"line\"/>were the leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians who have brought me to a strange land. Verily they said that they would bring me to clear-seen <placeName key=\"tgn,7013803\">Ithaca</placeName>, but they have not made good their word. May Zeus, the suppliant's god, requite them, who watches over all men, and punishes him that sins.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>But come, I will number the goods, and go over them, lest to my cost these men have carried off aught with them in the hollow ship.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"217"},{"n":"217","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"217\">\n    <p>\n    So he spake, and set him to count the beautiful tripods, and the cauldrons, and the gold, and the fair woven raiment, and of these he missed nothing. Then, mournfully longing for his native land,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>he paced by the shore of the loud-sounding sea, uttering many a moan. And Athena drew near him in the form of a young man, a herdsman of sheep, one most delicate, as are the sons of princes. In a double fold about her shoulders she wore a well-wrought cloak,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"225\" unit=\"line\"/>and beneath her shining feet she had sandals, and in her hands a spear. Then Odysseus was glad at sight of her, and came to meet her, and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words:\n    “Friend, since thou art the first to whom I have come in this land, hail to thee, and mayst thou meet me with no evil mind.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"230\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay, save this treasure, and save me; for to thee do I pray, as to a god, and am come to thy dear knees. And tell me this also truly, that I may know full well. What land, what people is this? What men dwell here? Is it some clear-seen island, or a shore<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>of the deep-soiled mainland that lies resting on the sea?”\n    Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “A fool art thou, stranger, or art come from far, if indeed thou askest of this land. Surely it is no wise so nameless, but full many know it,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"240\" unit=\"line\"/>both all those who dwell toward the dawn and the sun, and all those that are behind toward the murky darkness. It is a rugged isle, not fit for driving horses, yet it is not utterly poor, though it be but narrow. Therein grows corn beyond measure, and the wine-grape as well,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"245\" unit=\"line\"/>and the rain never fails it, nor the rich dew. It is a good land for pasturing goats and kine; there are trees of every sort, and in it also pools for watering that fail not the year through. Therefore, stranger, the name of <placeName key=\"tgn,7013803\">Ithaca</placeName> has reached even to the land of <placeName key=\"tgn,7014164\">Troy</placeName> which, they say, is far from this land of Achaea.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"250"},{"n":"250","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"250\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"250\" unit=\"line\"/>So she spake, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, and rejoiced in his land, the land of his fathers, as he heard the word of Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis; and he spoke, and addressed her with winged words; yet he spoke not the truth, but checked the word ere it was uttered,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"255\" unit=\"line\"/>ever revolving in his breast thoughts of great cunning:\n    “I heard of <placeName key=\"tgn,7013803\">Ithaca</placeName>, even in broad <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName>, far over the sea; and now have I myself come hither with these my goods. And I left as much more with my children, when I fled the land, after I had slain the dear son of Idomeneus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"260\" unit=\"line\"/>Orsilochus, swift of foot, who in broad <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName> surpassed in fleetness all men that live by toil. Now he would have robbed me of all that booty of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, for which I had borne grief of heart, passing through wars of men and the grievous waves,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"265\" unit=\"line\"/>for that I would not shew favour to his father, and serve as his squire in the land of the Trojans, but commanded other men of my own. So I smote him with my bronze-tipped spear as he came home from the field, lying in wait for him with one of my men by the roadside. A dark night covered the heavens, and no<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"270\" unit=\"line\"/>man was ware of us, but unseen I took away his life. Now when I had slain him with the sharp bronze, I went straightway to a ship, and made prayer to the lordly Phoenicians, giving them booty to satisfy their hearts.

With eager haste we rowed on into the harbor, nor had we any<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"280\" unit=\"line\"/>thought of supper, sore as was our need of it, but even as we were we went forth from the ship and lay down, one and all. Then upon me came sweet sleep in my weariness, but they took my goods out of the hollow ship and set them where I myself lay on the sands.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"285\" unit=\"line\"/>And they went on board, and departed for the well-peopled land of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002861\">Sidon</placeName>; but I was left here, my heart sore troubled.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"287"},{"n":"287","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"287\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, smiled, and stroked him with her hand, and changed herself to the form of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"290\" unit=\"line\"/>And she spoke, and addressed him with winged words:\n    “Cunning must he be and knavish, who would go beyond thee in all manner of guile, aye, though it were a god that met thee.

But come, let us no longer talk of this, being both well versed in craft, since thou art far the best of all men in counsel and in speech, and I among all the gods am famed for wisdom and craft. Yet thou didst not know<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"300\" unit=\"line\"/>Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, even me, who ever stand by thy side, and guard thee in all toils. Aye, and I made thee beloved by all the Phaeacians. And now am I come hither to weave a plan with thee, and to hide all the treasure, which the lordly Phaeacians<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"305\" unit=\"line\"/>gave thee by my counsel and will, when thou didst set out for home; and to tell thee all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil in thy well-built house.

But as for me, I never doubted of this, but in my heart<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"340\" unit=\"line\"/>knew it well, that thou wouldest come home after losing all thy comrades.

Then the two sat them down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised death for the insolent wooers.

There do thou stay, and sitting by his side question him of all things, while I go to <placeName key=\"perseus,Sparta\">Sparta</placeName>, the land of fair women, to summon thence Telemachus, thy dear son, Odysseus, who went to spacious <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName> to the house of Menelaus,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>to seek tidings of thee, if thou wast still anywhere alive.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"416"},{"n":"416","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"416\">\n    <p>\n    Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Why then, I pray thee, didst thou not tell him, thou whose mind knows all things? Nay, was it haply that he too might suffer woes, wandering over the unresting sea, and that others might devour his substance?”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Nay verily, not for him be thy heart overmuch troubled. It was I that guided him, that he might win good report by going thither, and he has no toil, but sits in peace in the palace of the son of Atreus, and good cheer past telling is before him.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>Truly young men in a black ship lie in wait for him, eager to slay him before he comes to his native land, but methinks this shall not be. Ere that shall the earth cover many a one of the wooers that devour thy substance.”\n    So saying, Athena touched him with her wand.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>She withered the fair flesh on his supple limbs, and destroyed the flaxen hair from off his head, and about all his limbs she put the skin of an aged old man. And she dimmed his two eyes that were before so beautiful, and clothed him in other raiment,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>a vile ragged cloak and a tunic, tattered garments and foul, begrimed with filthy smoke. And about him she cast the great skin of a swift hind, stripped of the hair, and she gave him a staff, and a miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord.\n    So when the two had thus taken counsel together, they parted; and thereupon the goddess<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>went to goodly <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName> to fetch the son of Odysseus.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
