But if thy master does not come as I say, set the slaves upon me, and fling me down from a great cliff,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>that another beggar may beware of deceiving.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"401"},{"n":"401","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"401\">\n    <p>\n    And the goodly swineherd answered him, and said: “Aye, stranger, so should I indeed win fair fame and prosperity among men both now and hereafter, if I, who brought thee to my hut and gave thee entertainment,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>should then slay thee, and take away thy dear life. With a ready heart thereafter should I pray to Zeus, son of Cronos. But it is now time for supper, and may my comrades soon be here, that we may make ready a savoury supper in the hut.”\n    Thus they spoke to one another,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>and the swine and the swineherds drew near. The sows they shut up to sleep in their wonted sties, and a wondrous noise arose from them, as they were penned. Then the goodly swineherd called to his comrades saying: \n    “Bring forth the best of the boars, that I may slaughter him for the stranger<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>who comes from afar, and we too shall have some profit therefrom, who have long borne toil and suffering for the sake of the white-tusked swine, while others devour our labour without atonement.”\n    So saying, he split wood with the pitiless bronze, and the others brought in a fatted boar of five years old,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>and set him by the hearth. Nor did the swineherd forget the immortals, for he had an understanding heart, but as a first offering he cast into the fire bristles from the head of the white-tusked boar, and made prayer to all the gods that wise Odysseus might return to his own house.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he raised himself up, and smote the boar with a billet of oak, which he had left when splitting the wood, and the boar's life left him. And the others cut the boar's throat, and signed him, and quickly cut him up, and the swineherd took as first offerings bits of raw flesh from all the limbs, and laid them in the rich fat. These he cast into the fire, when he had sprinkled them with barley meal,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>but the rest they cut up and spitted, and roasted it carefully, and drew it all off the spits, and cast it in a heap on platters. Then the swineherd stood up to carve, for well did his heart know what was fair, and he cut up the mess and divided it into seven portions.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>One with a prayer he set aside for the nymphs and for Hermes, son of <placeName key=\"tgn,1049816\">Maia</placeName>, and the rest he distributed to each. And Odysseus he honored with the long chine of the white-tusked boar, and made glad the heart of his master; and Odysseus of many wiles spoke to him, and said:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>“Eumaeus, mayest thou be as dear to father Zeus as thou art to me, since thou honourest me with a good portion, albeit I am in such plight.” \n    To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Eat, unhappy stranger, and have joy of such fare as is here. It is the god that will give one thing and withhold another,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>even as seems good to his heart; for he can do all things.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"446"},{"n":"446","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"446\">\n    <p>\n    He spoke, and sacrificed the firstling pieces to the gods that are for ever, and, when he had made libations of the flaming wine, he placed the cup in the hands of Odysseus, the sacker of cities, and took his seat by his own portion. And bread was served to them by Mesaulius, whom the swineherd<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>had gotten by himself alone, while his master was gone, without the knowledge of his mistress or the old Laertes, buying him of the Taphians with his own goods. So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Mesaulius took away the food, and they were fain to go to their rest, sated with bread and meat.\n    Now the night came on, foul and without a moon, and Zeus rained the whole night through, and the West Wind, ever the rainy wind, blew strong. Then Odysseus spoke among them, making trial of the swineherd,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>to see whether he would strip off his own cloak and give it him, or bid some other of his comrades to do so, since he cared for him so greatly:\n    “Hear me now, Eumaeus and all the rest of you, his men, with a wish in my heart will I tell a tale; for the wine bids me, befooling wine, which sets one, even though he be right wise, to singing<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>and laughing softly, and makes him stand up and dance, aye, and brings forth a word which were better unspoken. Still, since I have once spoken out, I will hide nothing. Would that I were young and my strength firm as when we made ready our ambush, and led it beneath the walls of <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Troy</placeName>.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>The leaders were Odysseus and Menelaus, son of Atreus, and with them I was third in command; for so had they ordered it themselves. Now when we had come to the city and the steep wall, round about the town in the thick brushwood among the needs and swamp-land<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>we lay, crouching beneath our arms, and night came on, foul, when the North Wind had fallen, and frosty, and snow came down on us from above, covering us like rime, bitter cold, and ice formed upon our shields. Now all the rest had cloaks and tunics, and slept in peace, with their shields covering their shoulders,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>but I, when I set out, had left my cloak behind with my comrades in my folly, for I did not think that even so I should be cold, and had come with my shield alone and my bright kilt. But when it was the third watch of the night, and the stars had turned their course, then I spoke to Odysseus, who was near me,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>nudging him with my elbow; and he straightway gave ear:\n    “Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, lo now, no longer shall I be among the living. Nay, the cold is killing me, for I have no cloak. Some god beguiled me to wear my tunic only, and now there is no more escape.’\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>“So I spoke, and he then devised this plan in his heart, such a man was he both to plan and to fight; and speaking in a low voice he said to me: ‘Be silent now, lest another of the Achaeans hear thee.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"494"},{"n":"494","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"494\">\n    <p>\n    “With this he raised his head upon his elbow, and spoke, saying:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>‘Hear me, friends; a dream from the gods came to me in my sleep. Lo, we have come very far from the ships, and I would that there were one to bear word to Agamemnon, son of Atreus, shepherd of the host, in the hope that he might bid more men to come from the ships.’\n    “So he spoke, and Thoas, son of Andraemon, sprang up<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>quickly, and from him flung his purple cloak, and set out to run to the ships. Then in his garment I gladly lay, and golden-throned Dawn appeared. Would that I were young as then, and my strength as firm; then would one of the swineherds in the farmstead give me a cloak<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"505\" unit=\"line\"/>both from kindness and from respect for a brave warrior. But as it is they scorn me, since I have foul raiment about me.”\n    To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, the tale thou hast told is a good one, nor hast thou thus far spoken aught amiss or unprofitably.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"510\" unit=\"line\"/>Wherefore thou shalt lack neither clothing nor aught else that a sore-tried suppliant should receive, when he meets one—for this night at least; but in the morning thou shalt shake about thee those rags of thine. For not many cloaks are here or changes of tunics to put on, but each man has one alone.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>But when the dear son of Odysseus comes, he will himself give thee a cloak and a tunic as raiment, and will send thee whithersoever thy heart and spirit bid thee go.”\n    So saying, he sprang up and placed a bed for Odysseus near the fire, and cast upon it skins of sheep and goats.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>There Odysseus lay down, and the swineherd threw over him a great thick cloak, which he kept at hand for a change of clothing whenever a terrible storm should arise.\n    So there Odysseus slept, and beside him slept the young men. But the swineherd<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>liked not a bed in that place, that he should lay him down away from the boars; so he made ready to go outside. And Odysseus was glad that he took such care of his master's substance while he was afar. First Eumaeus flung his sharp sword over his strong shoulders, and then put about him a cloak, very thick, to keep off the wind;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>and he picked up the fleece of a large, well-fatted goat, took a sharp javelin to ward off dogs and men, and went forth to lie down to sleep where the white-tusked boars slept beneath a hollow rock, in a place sheltered from the North Wind.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
