We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion, sacked it, and brought\n    hither the spoil.

On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for\n    respecting the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so\n    Agamemnon, who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"380\" unit=\"line\"/>So he went back in anger, and Apollo, who loved\n    him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god sent a deadly dart upon the Argives,\n    and the people died thick on one another, for the arrows went everywhere among\n    the wide host of the Achaeans. At last a seer [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mantis</term>] </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"385\" unit=\"line\"/>in the fullness of his knowledge declared to us\n    the oracles of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should appease\n    him.

Meanwhile Odysseus reached <placeName key=\"perseus,Chryse\">Chryse</placeName> with the hecatomb.

But Achilles stayed at his ships and nursed his anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>]. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>He went not to the honorable assembly, and\n    sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed at his own heart, pining for battle and\n    the war-cry.
