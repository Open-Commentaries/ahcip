The stretch of the shore, wide\n    though it was, did not afford room for all the ships, and the host was cramped\n    for space, therefore they had placed the ships in rows one behind the other,\n    and had filled the whole opening of the bay between the two points that formed\n    it. The kings, leaning on their spears, were coming out to survey the fight,\n    being in great anxiety, and when old Nestor met them they were filled with\n    dismay.

As\n    he was thus retreating, Ajax son of Telamon struck him with a stone, of which\n    there were many lying about</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>under the men's feet as they fought - brought\n    there to give support to the ships' sides as they lay on the shore. Ajax caught\n    up one of them and struck Hektor above the rim of his shield close to his neck;\n    the blow made him spin round like a top and reel in all directions. As an oak\n    falls headlong when uprooted by the lightning flash of father Zeus, and there\n    is a terrible smell of brimstone - no man can help being dismayed if he is\n    standing near it, for a thunderbolt is a very awful thing - even so did Hektor\n    fall to earth and bite the dust. His spear fell from his hand, but his shield\n    and helmet were made fast about his body, and his bronze armor rang about him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"421\" unit=\"line\"/>The sons of the Achaeans came running with a\n    loud cry towards him, hoping to drag him away, and they showered their darts on\n    the Trojans, but none of them could wound him before he was surrounded and\n    covered by the princes Polydamas, Aeneas, Agenor, Sarpedon leader of the\n    Lycians, and noble Glaukos: of the others, too, there was not one who was\n    unmindful of him, and they held their round shields over him to cover him. His\n    comrades then lifted him off the ground and bore him away from the battle\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] to the place where his horses stood\n    waiting for him at the rear of the fight with their driver and the chariot;\n    these then took him towards the city groaning and in great pain. When they\n    reached the ford of the air stream of <placeName key=\"perseus,Xanthos\">Xanthos</placeName>, begotten of Immortal Zeus, they took him from off his\n    chariot and laid him down on the ground; they poured water over him, and as\n    they did so he breathed again and opened his eyes. Then kneeling on his knees\n    he vomited blood, but soon fell back on to the ground, and his eyes were again\n    closed in darkness for he was still stunned by the blow. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>When the Argives saw Hektor leaving the field,\n    they took heart and set upon the Trojans yet more furiously. Ajax fleet son of\n    Oileus began by springing on Satnios son of Enops and wounding him with his\n    spear: a fair naiad nymph had borne him to Enops</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>as he was herding cattle by the banks of the\n    river Satnioeis. The son of Oileus came up to him and struck him in the flank\n    so that he fell, and a fierce fight between Trojans and Danaans raged round his\n    body. Polydamas son of Panthoos drew near to avenge him, and wounded Prothoenor\n    son of Areilykos on the right shoulder; the terrible spear went right through\n    his shoulder, and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust. Polydamas\n    vaunted loudly over him saying, \"Again I take it that the spear has not sped in\n    vain from the strong hand of the son of Panthoos; an <placeName key=\"tgn,5001993\">Argive</placeName> has caught it in his body, and it will\n    serve him for a staff as he goes down into the house of Hades.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"458\" unit=\"line\"/>The Argives were stung by grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] on account of this boasting. Ajax son of\n    Telamon was more angry than any, for the man had fallen close be, him; so he\n    aimed at Polydamas as he was retreating, but Polydamas saved himself by\n    swerving aside and the spear struck Arkhelokhos son of Antenor, for heaven\n    counseled his destruction; it struck him where the head springs from the neck\n    at the top joint of the spine, and severed both the tendons at the back of the\n    head. His head, mouth, and nostrils reached the ground long before his legs and\n    knees could do so, and Ajax shouted to Polydamas saying, \"Think, Polydamas, and\n    tell me truly whether this man is not as well worth killing as Prothoenor was:\n    he seems rich, and of rich family, a brother, it may be, or son of the horseman\n    Antenor, for he is very like him.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"475"},{"n":"475","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"475\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>But he knew well who it was, and the Trojans\n    were greatly vexed with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>]. Akamas then\n    bestrode his brother's body and wounded Promakhos the Boeotian with his spear,\n    for he was trying to drag his brother's body away. Akamas vaunted loudly over\n    him saying, \"<placeName key=\"tgn,5001993\">Argive</placeName> archers, braggarts\n    that you are, toil [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and suffering shall not\n    be for us only, but some of you too shall fall here as well as ourselves. See\n    how Promakhos now sleeps, vanquished by my spear; payment for my brother's\n    blood has not long delayed; a man, therefore, may well be thankful if he leaves\n    a kinsman in his house behind him to avenge his fall.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"486\" unit=\"line\"/>His taunts gave grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] to the Argives, and Peneleos was more enraged than any of\n    them. He sprang towards Akamas, but Akamas did not stand his ground, and he\n    killed Ilioneus son of the rich flock-master Phorbas, whom Hermes had favored\n    and endowed with greater wealth than any other of the Trojans. Ilioneus was his\n    only son, and Peneleos now wounded him in the eye under his eyebrows, tearing\n    the eye-ball from its socket: the spear went right through the eye into the\n    nape of the neck, and he fell, stretching out both hands before him. Peneleos\n    then drew his sword and smote him on the neck, so that both head and helmet\n    came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in the eye; he\n    then held up the head, as though it had been a poppy-head, and showed it to the\n    Trojans, vaunting over them as he did so. \"Trojans,\" he cried, \"bid the father\n    and mother of noble Ilioneus make moan for him in their house, for the wife\n    also of Promakhos son of Alegenor will never be gladdened by the coming of her\n    dear husband - when we Argives return with our ships from <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"506\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke fear fell upon them, and every man\n    looked round about to see whither he might flee for safety. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"508\" unit=\"line\"/>Tell me now, O Muses that dwell on <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, who was the first of the Argives to\n    bear away blood-stained spoils after Poseidon lord of the earthquake had turned\n    the fortune of war. Ajax son of Telamon was first to wound Hyrtios son of\n    Gyrtios, leader of the staunch Mysians. Antilokhos killed Phalces and Mermerus,\n    while Meriones slew Morys and Hippotion, Teucer also killed Prothoon and\n    Periphetes. The son of Atreus then wounded Hyperenor shepherd of his people, in\n    the flank, and the bronze point made his entrails gush out as it tore in among\n    them; on this his life-breath [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] came\n    hurrying out of him at the place where he had been wounded, and his eyes were\n    closed in darkness. Ajax son of Oileus killed more than any other, for there\n    was no man so fleet as he to pursue fleeing foes when Zeus had spread panic\n    among them. <milestone n=\"522\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
