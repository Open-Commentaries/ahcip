Nay, do thou pray to our father, the lord Poseidon.’\n    “So they spoke and went their way; and my heart laughed within me that my name and cunning device had so beguiled.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>But the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, groaning and travailing in anguish, groped with his hands and took away the stone from the door, and himself sat in the doorway with arms outstretched in the hope of catching anyone who sought to go forth with the sheep—so witless, forsooth, he thought in his heart to find me.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>But I took counsel how all might be the very best, if I might haply find some way of escape from death for my comrades and for myself. And I wove all manner of wiles and counsel, as a man will in a matter of life and death; for great was the evil that was nigh us. And this seemed to my mind the best plan.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>Rams there were, well-fed and thick of fleece, fine beasts and large, with wool dark as the violet. These I silently bound together with twisted withes on which the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, that monster with his heart set on lawlessness, was wont to sleep. Three at a time I took. The one in the middle in each case bore a man,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>and the other two went, one on either side, saving my comrades. Thus every three sheep bore a man. But as for me—there was a ram, far the best of all the flock; him I grasped by the back, and curled beneath his shaggy belly, lay there face upwards<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>with steadfast heart, clinging fast with my hands to his wondrous fleece. So then, with wailing, we waited for the bright dawn.\n    “As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then the males of the flock hastened forth to pasture and the females bleated unmilked about the pens,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"440\" unit=\"line\"/>for their udders were bursting. And their master, distressed with grievous pains, felt along the backs of all the sheep as they stood up before him, but in his folly he marked not this, that my men were bound beneath the breasts of his fleecy sheep. Last of all the flock the ram went forth,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"445\" unit=\"line\"/>burdened with the weight of his fleece and my cunning self. And mighty Polyphemus, as he felt along his back, spoke to him, saying:\n    “‘Good ram, why pray is it that thou goest forth thus through the cave the last of the flock? Thou hast not heretofore been wont to lag behind the sheep, but wast ever far the first to feed on the tender bloom of the grass,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>moving with long strides, and ever the first didst reach the streams of the river, and the first didst long to return to the fold at evening. But now thou art last of all. Surely thou art sorrowing for the eye of thy master, which an evil man blinded along with his miserable fellows, when he had overpowered my wits with wine,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>even Noman, who, I tell thee, has not yet escaped destruction. If only thou couldst feel as I do, and couldst get thee power of speech to tell me where he skulks away from my wrath, then should his brains be dashed on the ground here and there throughout the cave, when I had smitten him, and my heart<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>should be lightened of the woes which good-for-naught Noman has brought me.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"461"},{"n":"461","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"461\">\n    <p>\n    “So saying, he sent the ram forth from him. And when we had gone a little way from the cave and the court, I first loosed myself from under the ram and set my comrades free. Speedily then we drove off those long-shanked sheep, rich with fat,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>turning full often to look about until we came to the ship. And welcome to our dear comrades was the sight of us who had escaped death, but for the others they wept and wailed; yet I would not suffer them to weep, but with a frown forbade each man. Rather I bade them<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>to fling on board with speed the many sheep of goodly fleece, and sail over the salt water. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars. But when I was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, then I spoke to the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> with mocking words:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>“‘<placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, that man, it seems, was no weakling, whose comrades thou wast minded to devour by brutal strength in thy hollow cave. Full surely were thy evil deeds to fall on thine own head, thou cruel wretch, who didst not shrink from eating thy guests in thine own house. Therefore has Zeus taken vengeance on thee, and the other gods.’\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>“So I spoke, and he waxed the more wroth at heart, and broke off the peak of a high mountain and hurled it at us, and cast it in front of the dark-prowed ship.<note anchored=\"true\" resp=\"Loeb\">1</note> And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>and the backward flow, like a flood from the deep, bore the ship swiftly landwards and drove it upon the shore. But I seized a long pole in my hands and shoved the ship off and along the shore,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>and with a nod of my head I roused my comrades, and bade them fall to their oars that we might escape out of our evil plight. And they bent to their oars and rowed. But when, as we fared over the sea, we were twice as far distant, then was I fain to call to the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, though round about me my comrades, one after another, sought to check me with gentle words:\n    “‘Reckless one, why wilt thou provoke to wrath a savage man,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>who but now hurled his missile into the deep and drove our ship back to the land, and verily we thought that we had perished there? And had he heard one of us uttering a sound or speaking, he would have hurled a jagged rock and crushed our heads and the timbers of our ship, so mightily does he throw.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"500"},{"n":"500","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"500\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>“So they spoke, but they could not persuade my great-hearted spirit; and I answered him again with angry heart:\n    “‘<placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye, say that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, blinded it,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"505\" unit=\"line\"/>even the son of Laertes, whose home is in <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>.’\n    “So I spoke, and he groaned and said in answer:‘Lo now, verily a prophecy uttered long ago is come upon me. There lived here a soothsayer, a good man and tall, Telemus, son of Eurymus, who excelled all men in soothsaying,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"510\" unit=\"line\"/>and grew old as a seer among the Cyclopes. He told me that all these things should be brought to pass in days to come, that by the hands of Odysseus I should lose my sight. But I ever looked for some tall and comely man to come hither, clothed in great might,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"515\" unit=\"line\"/>but now one that is puny, a man of naught and a weakling, has blinded me of my eye when he had overpowered me with wine. Yet come hither, Odysseus, that I may set before thee gifts of entertainment, and may speed thy sending hence, that the glorious Earth-shaker may grant it thee. For I am his son, and he declares himself my father;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/> and he himself will heal me, if it be his good pleasure, but none other either of the blessed gods or of mortal men.’\n    “So he spoke, and I answered him and said:‘Would that I were able to rob thee of soul and life, and to send thee to the house of Hades,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>as surely as not even the Earth-shaker shall heal thine eye.’\n    “So I spoke, and he then prayed to the lord Poseidon, stretching out both his hands to the starry heaven: ‘Hear me, Poseidon, earth-enfolder, thou dark-haired god, if indeed I am thy son and thou declarest thyself my father;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>grant that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, may never reach his home, even the son of Laertes, whose home is in <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>; but if it is his fate to see his friends and to reach his well-built house and his native land, late may he come and in evil case, after losing all his comrades,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"535\" unit=\"line\"/>in a ship that is another's; and may he find woes in his house.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"536"},{"n":"536","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"536\">\n    <p>\n    “So he spoke in prayer, and the dark-haired god heard him. But the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> lifted on high again a far greater stone, and swung and hurled it, putting into the throw measureless strength. He cast it<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>a little behind the dark-prowed ship, and barely missed the end of the steering-oar. And the sea surged beneath the stone as it fell, and the wave bore the ship onward and drove it to the shore.\n    “Now when we had come to the island, where our other well-benched ships lay all together, and round about them our comrades,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"545\" unit=\"line\"/>ever expecting us, sat weeping, then, on coming thither, we beached our ship on the sands, and ourselves went forth upon the shore of the sea. Then we took from out the hollow ship the flocks of the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, and divided them, that so far as in me lay no man might go defrauded of an equal share.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"550\" unit=\"line\"/>But the ram my well-greaved comrades gave to me alone, when the flocks were divided, as a gift apart; and on the shore I sacrificed him to Zeus, son of Cronos, god of the dark clouds, who is lord of all, and burned the thigh-pieces. Howbeit he heeded not my sacrifice, but was planning how all<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"555\" unit=\"line\"/>my well-benched ships might perish and my trusty comrades.\n    “So, then, all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine; but when the sun set and darkness came on, then we lay down to rest on the shore of the sea.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"560\" unit=\"line\"/>And as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, I roused my comrades, and bade them themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway and sat down upon the benches, and sitting well in order smote the grey sea with their oars.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"565\" unit=\"line\"/>“Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, glad to have escaped death, though we had lost our dear comrades.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
