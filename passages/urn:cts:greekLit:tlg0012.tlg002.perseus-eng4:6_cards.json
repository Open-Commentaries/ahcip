Now the Cyclopes were stronger in force [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>] than they and plundered them, so their king\n    Nausithoos moved them thence and settled them in <placeName key=\"tgn,7010886\">Scheria</placeName>, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with\n    a wall, built houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but\n    he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alkinoos, whose counsels\n    were inspired of heaven, was now reigning.

The girl, therefore, threw a ball at\n    one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water.

On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the\n    others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the\n    daughter of Alkinoos stood firm, for Athena put courage into her heart and took\n    away all fear from her.
