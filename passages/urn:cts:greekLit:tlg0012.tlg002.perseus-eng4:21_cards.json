She went upstairs\n    and got the store room key, which was made of bronze and had a handle of ivory;\n    she then went with her maidens into the store room at the end of the house,\n    where her husband's treasures of gold, bronze, and wrought iron were kept, and\n    where was also his bow, and the quiver full of deadly arrows that had been\n    given him by a friend whom he had met in <placeName key=\"tgn,7011065\">Lacedaemon</placeName> - Iphitos the son of Eurytos. The two fell in with\n    one another in <placeName key=\"perseus,Messene\">Messene</placeName> at the\n    house of Ortilokhos, where Odysseus was staying in order to recover a debt that\n    was owing from the whole <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>; for the Messenians\n    had carried off three hundred sheep from <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, and had sailed away with them and with their shepherds.\n    In quest of these Odysseus took a long journey while still quite young, for his\n    father and the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitos\n    had gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had lost,\n    and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were the death of\n    him in the end, for when he went to the house of Zeus’ son, mighty Herakles,\n    who performed such prodigies of valor, Herakles to his shame killed him, though\n    he was his guest, for he feared not heaven's vengeance, nor yet respected his\n    own table which he had set before Iphitos, but killed him in spite of\n    everything, and kept the mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitos\n    met Odysseus, and gave him the bow which mighty Eurytos had been used to carry,\n    and which on his death had been left by him to his son. Odysseus gave him in\n    return a sword and a spear, and this was the beginning of a fast friendship,\n    although they never visited at one another's houses, for Zeus’ son Herakles\n    killed Iphitos ere they could do so. This bow, then, given him by Iphitos, had\n    not been taken with him by Odysseus when he sailed for <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>; he had used it so long as he had been\n    at home, but had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued\n    friend.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"42\" unit=\"line\"/>Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of\n    the store room; the carpenter had planed this duly, and had drawn a line on it\n    so as to get it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung\n    the doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door, put in the key,\n    and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the doors; these\n    flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a meadow, and Penelope stepped\n    upon the raised platform, where the chests stood in which the fair linen and\n    clothes were laid by along with fragrant herbs: reaching thence, she took down\n    the bow with its bow case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it\n    on her knees, weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case, and when\n    her tears had relieved her, she went to the room where the suitors were,\n    carrying the bow and the quiver, with the many deadly arrows that were inside\n    it. Along with her came her maidens, bearing a chest that contained much iron\n    and bronze which her husband had won as prizes. When she reached the suitors,\n    she stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the room, holding\n    a veil before her face, and with a maid on either side of her.

Then he stamped the earth tight round them, and everyone was\n    surprised when they saw him set up so orderly, though he had never seen\n    anything of the kind before.

He was trying forcefully [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">biê</term>] for the fourth\n    time, and would have strung it had not Odysseus made a sign to check him in\n    spite of all his eagerness.

There was a ship's cable of papyrus\n    fiber lying in the gatehouse, so he made the gates fast with it and then came\n    in again, resuming the seat that he had left, and keeping an eye on Odysseus,\n    who had now got the bow in his hands, and was turning it every way about, and\n    proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into its two horns\n    during his absence. Then would one turn towards his neighbor saying, \"This is\n    some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has got one like it at home, or he wants\n    to make one, in such workmanlike style does the old vagabond handle it.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"401\" unit=\"line\"/>Another said, \"I hope he may be no more\n    successful in other things than he is likely to be in stringing this bow.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"404\" unit=\"line\"/>But Odysseus, when he had taken it up and\n    examined it all over, strung it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg\n    of his lyre and makes the twisted gut fast at both ends.

When he had\n    taken aim he let fly, and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of\n    the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them, and into\n    the outer courtyard.
