It is an island that\n    floats (as it were) upon the sea, iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,\n    Aeolus has six daughters and six sons in the bloom of youth, so he made the\n    sons marry the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,\n    feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the\n    atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savor of roasting meats till it\n    groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well-made\n    bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets.

I told him exactly how\n    everything had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked him to further me\n    on my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once.\n    Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds,\n    which he shut up in the hide as in a sack - for Zeus had made him captain over\n    the winds, and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own\n    pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly with a\n    silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow from any\n    quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let blow as it chose;\n    but it all came to nothing, for we were lost through our own folly.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"28\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Nine days and nine nights did we sail, and on\n    the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we\n    could see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then dead tired, fell into a\n    light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands, that we might\n    get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among themselves, and said\n    I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me.\n    ‘Bless my heart,’ would one turn to his neighbor, saying, ‘how this man gets\n    honored and makes friends in whatever city or country he may go. See what fine\n    prizes he is taking home from <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>,\n    while we, who have traveled just as far as he has, come back with hands as\n    empty as we set out with - and now Aeolus has given him ever so much more.\n    Quick - let us see what it all is, and how much gold and silver there is in the\n    sack he gave him.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"46\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus they talked and evil counsels prevailed.\n    They loosed the sack, whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm\n    that carried us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke,\n    and knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the\n    best of it; but I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while\n    the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the\n    Aeolian island.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"56"},{"n":"56","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"56\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"56\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When we reached it we went ashore to take in\n    water, and dined hard by the ships.

They were astounded when they saw us and said, ‘Odysseus, what\n    brings you here? What <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> has been ill-treating\n    you?

I kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the\n    very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoiter, but could see\n    no sign neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground.

She was going\n    to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water, and when my\n    men had come close up to her, they asked her who the king of that country might\n    be, and over what kind of people he ruled; so she directed them to her father's\n    house, but when they got there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as\n    a mountain, and they were horrified at the sight of her.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"114\" unit=\"line\"/>\"She at once called her husband Antiphates from\n    the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched\n    up one of them, and began to make his dinner of him then and there, whereon the\n    other two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates\n    raised a hue and cry after them, and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang\n    up from every quarter - ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the\n    cliffs as though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the\n    ships crunching up against one another, and the death cries of my men, as the\n    Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat them. While\n    they were thus killing my men within the harbor I drew my sword, cut the cable\n    of my own ship, and told my men to row with all their might if they too would\n    not fare like the rest; so they laid out for their lives, and we were thankful\n    enough when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us.\n    As for the others there was not one of them left.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"133\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have\n    escaped death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island,\n    where Circe lives, a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the\n    magician Aietes - for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is\n    daughter to Okeanos. We brought our ship into a safe harbor without a word, for\n    some god guided us there, and having landed we stayed there for two days and\n    two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day came I\n    took my spear and my sword, and went away from the ship to reconnoiter, and see\n    if I could discover signs of human handiwork, or hear the sound of voices.\n    Climbing to the top of a high look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house\n    rising upwards amid a dense forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted\n    whether, having seen the smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more,\n    but in the end I deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their\n    dinners, and send some of them instead of going myself.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"156"},{"n":"156","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"156\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"156\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When I had nearly got back to the ship some\n    god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine antlered stag right into the\n    middle of my path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the\n    river, for the heat of the sun drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the\n    middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and\n    he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot\n    upon him, drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough\n    grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of good stout rope, with\n    which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together; having so done I\n    hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear, for\n    the stag was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder,\n    steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship, I called\n    the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‘Look here my\n    friends,’ said I, ‘we are not going to die so much before our time after all,\n    and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have got something to eat and\n    drink on board.’ On this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and\n    admired the stag, for he was indeed a splendid man. Then, when they had feasted\n    their eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook him\n    for dinner.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"183\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus through the livelong day to the going\n    down of the sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun\n    went down and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of\n    morning, fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said, ‘My friends, we\n    are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no idea where\n    the sun either sets or rises, so that we do not even know East from West. I see\n    no way out of it; nevertheless, we must try and find one. We are certainly on\n    an island, for I went as high as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching\n    all round it to the horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke\n    rising from out of a thick forest of trees.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"198\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Their hearts sank as they heard me, for they\n    remembered how they had been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates, and by\n    the savage ogre Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay, but there was\n    nothing to be got by crying, so I divided them into two companies and set a\n    leader over each; I gave one company to Eurylokhos, while I took command of the\n    other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet, and the lot fell upon Eurylokhos;\n    so he set out with his twenty-two men, and they wept, as also did we who were\n    left behind.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"210\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When they reached Circe's house they found it\n    built of cut stones, on a site that could be seen from far, in the middle of\n    the forest. There were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it -\n    poor bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged\n    into subjection. They did not attack my men, but wagged their great tails,\n    fawned upon them, and rubbed their noses lovingly against them. As hounds crowd\n    round their master when they see him coming from dinner - for they know he will\n    bring them something - even so did these wolves and lions with their great\n    claws fawn upon my men, but the men were terribly frightened at seeing such\n    strange creatures. Presently they reached the gates of the goddess’ house, and\n    as they stood there they could hear Circe within, singing most beautifully as\n    she worked at her loom, making a web so fine, so soft, and of such dazzling\n    colors as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites, whom I valued and\n    trusted more than any other of my men, said, ‘There is some one inside working\n    at a loom and singing most beautifully; the whole place resounds with it, let\n    us call her and see whether she is woman or goddess.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"229"},{"n":"229","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"229\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"229\" unit=\"line\"/>\"They called her and she came down, unfastened\n    the door, and bade them enter. They, thinking no evil, followed her, all except\n    Eurylokhos, who suspected mischief and stayed outside. When she had got them\n    into her house, she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a drink with\n    cheese, honey, meal, and Pramnian wine but she drugged it with wicked poisons\n    to make them forget their homes, and when they had drunk she turned them into\n    pigs by a stroke of her wand, and shut them up in her pigsties. They were like\n    pigs- head, hair, and all, and they grunted just as pigs do; but their senses\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] were the same as before, and they\n    remembered everything.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"241\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus then were they shut up squealing, and\n    Circe threw them some acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat, but Eurylokhos\n    hurried back to tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome\n    with dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so; his\n    eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh, till at last we forced\n    his story out of him, and he told us what had happened to the others.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"251\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘We went,’ said he, ‘as you told us, through\n    the forest, and in the middle of it there was a fine house built with cut\n    stones in a place that could be seen from far.

Rush not on your ruin by going to the\n    house of Circe, who will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions, and we shall\n    have to keep guard over her house. Remember how the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> treated us when our comrades went\n    inside his cave, and Odysseus with them. It was all through his sheer folly\n    that those men lost their lives.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"438\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When I heard him I was in two minds whether or\n    no to draw the keen blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in\n    spite of his being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him\n    and said, ‘Sir, if it may so be, let this man stay here and mind the ship, but\n    take the rest of us with you to Circe's house.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"446"},{"n":"446","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"446\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>\"On this we all went inland, and Eurylokhos was\n    not left behind after all, but came on too, for he was frightened by the severe\n    reprimand that I had given him.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"449\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Meanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men\n    who had been left behind were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also\n    given them woolen cloaks and shirts, and when we came we found them all\n    comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other face to\n    face and knew one another, they wept for joy and cried aloud till the whole\n    palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said, ‘Odysseus, noble son\n    of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, tell your men to leave\n    off crying; I know how much you have all of you suffered at sea, and how ill\n    you have fared among cruel savages on the mainland, but that is over now, so\n    stay here, and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and hearty as you\n    were when you left <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>; for at\n    present you are weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking\n    of the hardships - you have suffered during your travels, so that you have no\n    more cheerfulness left in you.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"466\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus did she speak and we assented. We stayed\n    with Circe for a whole twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of\n    meat and wine. But when the year had passed, and the seasons [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">hôrai</term>] had turned round, and the waning of moons and\n    the long days had begun, my men called me apart and said, ‘Sir, it is time you\n    began to think about going home, if so be you are to be spared to see your\n    house and native country at all.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Thus did they speak and I assented. Thereon\n    through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on\n    meat and wine, but when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid\n    themselves down to sleep in the covered cloisters. I, however, after I had got\n    into bed with Circe, besought her by her knees, and the goddess listened to\n    what I had got to say. ‘Circe,’ said I, ‘please keep the promise you made me\n    about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so do my men,\n    they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon as ever your back is\n    turned.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"487"},{"n":"487","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"487\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"487\" unit=\"line\"/>\"And the goddess answered, ‘Odysseus, noble son\n    of <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName>, you shall none of you\n    stay here any longer if you do not want to, but there is another journey which\n    you have got to take before you can sail homewards. You must go to the house of\n    Hades and of dread Persephone to consult the ghost [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] of the blind Theban seer [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mantis</term>] Teiresias whose mind [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">phrenes</term>] is\n    still in place within him. To him alone has Persephone left his consciousness\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] even in death, but the other ghosts flit\n    about aimlessly.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"496\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in\n    bed and wept, and would gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the\n    sun, but presently when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about, I\n    said, ‘And who shall guide me upon this voyage - for the house of Hades is a\n    port that no ship can reach.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"504\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘You will want no guide,’ she answered; ‘raise\n    you mast, set your white sails, sit quite still, and the North Wind will blow\n    you there of itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Okeanos, you\n    will reach the fertile shore of Persephone's country with its groves of tall\n    poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your ship upon\n    the shore of Okeanos, and go straight on to the dark abode of Hades. You will\n    find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus (which is a\n    branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron, and you will see a rock near it,\n    just where the two roaring rivers run into one another.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"516\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘When you have reached this spot, as I now\n    tell you, dig a trench a cubit or so in length, breadth, and depth, and pour\n    into it as a drink-offering to all the dead, first, honey mixed with milk, then\n    wine, and in the third place water-sprinkling white barley meal over the whole.\n    Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble ghosts, and promise\n    them that when you get back to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>\n    you will sacrifice a barren heifer to them, the best you have, and will load\n    the pyre with good things.

On this, many dead men's ghosts [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhai</term>] will come to you, and you must tell your men to skin the\n    two sheep that you have just killed, and offer them as a burnt sacrifice with\n    prayers to Hades and to Persephone. Then draw your sword and sit there, so as\n    to prevent any other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before\n    Teiresias shall have answered your questions. The seer [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mantis</term>] will presently come to you, and will tell you about your\n    voyage - what stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea so as to\n    reach your home [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">nostos</term>].’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"541\" unit=\"line\"/>\"It was day-break by the time she had done\n    speaking, so she dressed me in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a\n    beautiful light gossamer fabric over her shoulders, fastening it with a golden\n    girdle round her waist, and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went\n    about among the men everywhere all over the house, and spoke kindly to each of\n    them man by man: ‘You must not lie sleeping here any longer,’ said I to them,\n    ‘we must be going, for Circe has told me all about it.’ And this they did as I\n    bade them.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"551\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Even so, however, I did not get them away\n    without misadventure. We had with us a certain youth named Elpenor, not very\n    remarkable for sense or courage, who had got drunk and was lying on the\n    house-top away from the rest of the men, to sleep off his liquor in the cool.\n    When he heard the noise of the men bustling about, he jumped up on a sudden and\n    forgot all about coming down by the main staircase, so he tumbled right off the\n    roof and broke his neck, and his soul [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] went\n    down to the house of Hades.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"561\" unit=\"line\"/>\"When I had got the men together I said to\n    them, ‘You think you are about to start home again, but Circe has explained to\n    me that instead of this, we have got to go to the house of Hades and Persephone\n    to consult the ghost of the Theban seer Teiresias.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"566"},{"n":"566","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"566\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"566\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The men were broken-hearted as they heard me,\n    and threw themselves on the ground groaning and tearing their hair, but they\n    did not mend matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore, weeping and\n    lamenting our fate, Circe brought the ram and the ewe, and we made them fast\n    hard by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,\n    for who can see the comings and goings of a god, if the god does not wish to be\n    seen? <milestone n=\"574\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
