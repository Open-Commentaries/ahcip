Athena endowed him with a presence of such\n    divine comeliness [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kharis</term>] that all marveled at him\n    as he went by, and when he took his place in his father's seat even the oldest\n    councilors made way for him.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>Aigyptios, a man bent double with age, and of\n    infinite experience, was the first to speak His son Antiphos had gone with\n    Odysseus to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, land of noble\n    steeds, but the savage <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> had\n    killed him when they were all shut up in the cave, and had cooked his last\n    dinner for him.

No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no\n    Odysseus to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against\n    them.

The suitors,\n    therefore, make you this answer, that both you and the Achaeans may understand\n    - ‘Send your mother away, and bid her marry the man of her own and of her\n    father's choice’; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us\n    much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments\n    Athena has taught her, and because she knows so many kinds of <term xml:lang=\"grc\">kerdos</term>.

Presently the crew came up, and the\n    goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"393\" unit=\"line\"/>Furthermore she went to the house of Odysseus,\n    and threw the suitors into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle\n    them, and made them drop their cups from their hands, so that instead of\n    sitting over their wine, they went back into the town to sleep, with their eyes\n    heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of Mentor, and\n    called Telemakhos to come outside.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"402\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Telemakhos,\" said she, \"the men are on board\n    and at their oars, waiting for you to give your orders, so make haste and let\n    us be off.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"405"},{"n":"405","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"405\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>On this she led the way, while Telemakhos\n    followed in her steps. When they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by\n    the water side, and Telemakhos said, \"Now my men, help me to get the stores on\n    board; they are all put together in the room, and my mother does not know\n    anything about it, nor any of the maid servants except one.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"413\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he led the way and the others\n    followed after. When they had brought the things as he told them, Telemakhos\n    went on board, Athena going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the\n    vessel, while Telemakhos sat beside her. Then the men loosed the hawsers and\n    took their places on the benches. Athena sent them a fair wind from the West,\n    that whistled over the seething deep waves whereon Telemakhos told them to\n    catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail, and they did as he told them. They set\n    the mast in its socket in the cross plank, raised it, and made it fast with the\n    forestays; then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox\n    hide. As the sail bellied out with the wind, the ship flew through the seething\n    deep water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then they\n    made all fast throughout the ship, filled the mixing-bowls to the brim, and\n    made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting, but more\n    particularly to the gray-eyed daughter of Zeus.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"434\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus, then, the ship sped on her way through\n    the watches of the night from dark till dawn.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
