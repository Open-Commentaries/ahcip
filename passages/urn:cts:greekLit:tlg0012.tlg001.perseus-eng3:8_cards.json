Forth from their chariots they stepped upon the ground, to hearken to the word that Hector dear to Zeus spake among them. In his hand he held a spear of eleven cubits, and before him blazed<milestone n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>the spear-point of bronze, around which ran a ring of gold.  Thereon he leaned, and spake his word among the Trojans:\n    <quote>Hearken to me, ye Trojans and Dardanians and allies: I deemed<milestone n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>but now to make havoc of the ships and all the Achaeans, and so return back again to windy Ilios; but darkness came on ere that might be, the which above all else hath now saved the Argives and their ships upon the beach of the sea.
