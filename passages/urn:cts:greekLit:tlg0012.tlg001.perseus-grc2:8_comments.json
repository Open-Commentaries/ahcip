[{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.010836","title":"Iliad 8.220-227","body":"<p>The ships of the Achaeans are beached along the shores of a large U-shaped bay that opens into the Hellespont. See <strong><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3276.7-conflicting-claims-on-homer\">Map 1</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3276.7-conflicting-claims-on-homer\">Map 2</a></strong> at HPC 157 and 158 respectively. Such a bay no longer exists, because of long-term silting from the river Scamander, which emptied into the bay. In the second millennium BCE and even later, however, the bay was very much of a reality, as the maps show, and the visualization in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> approximates such a topographical reality. This is not to say, however, that we should imagine the ships of the Achaeans as floating at anchor in the waters of such a bay: rather, the <em>Iliad</em> pictures the ships are beached along the shores of the bay, with their sterns facing inland and their prows facing out toward the waters. On this positioning, see also the comment on I.14.027–036. Exploring further the Iliadic visualization, we can see that the beached ship of Odysseus is located at the bottom of the U-shaped bay, at the south in the middle of the bayline, while the beached ships of Achilles and Ajax are located respectively at the upper left and the upper right tips of the U, at the northwest and northeast. To be highlighted here is a detail about the ship of Odysseus: the king Agamemnon is shown standing on the deck of this beached ship, which is said to be located <em>en messatōi</em> ‘in the middlemost space’, I.08.223, and from here this over-king projects his voice of royal authority, shouting mightily to all the Achaeans stationed at their own ships, I.08.227. Correspondingly, all the Achaeans stationed at all the beached ships can hear the king’s voice—from the ship of Achilles at one extreme of the U-shaped bay all the way to the ship of Ajax at the other extreme, I.08.224–226 (HPC 160–161). Agamemnon’s own beached ship, together with the ships of Diomedes and Nestor, is located near the ship of Odysseus, and it is in this ‘middlemost space’ of the U-shaped bayline that the central station of the Achaeans is visualized by the narrative, I.08.223. In the later comments at I.11.005–016, I.11.806–808, and I.14.027–036, there will be more to say about the locations of all these beached ships. To be highlighted already now, however, is the general reference to the <em>klisiai</em> or ‘shelters’ here at I.08.220, which are the abodes of the heroes. Then at I.08.224 the same word <em>klisiai</em> refers specifically to the abodes of Achilles and Ajax, mentioned at I.08.224–225. The description here shows that the <em>klisiai</em> ‘shelters’ of these two heroes are pointedly aligned with their beached ships. As for the ships beached at the middle of the bayline in the south, they mark a political and sacral centerpoint for the Achaeans. The evidence for the preceding formulation will be presented in the comment on I.11.806–808. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.220-8.227","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"post-heroic age"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sterns of the Achaean ships"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Scamander"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"klisiā ‘shelter’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hellespont"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eris  'strife'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"bay of the Hellespont"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"naustathmon ‘ship-station’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"headquarters of the Achaeans"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073105","title":"Iliad 8","body":"<p>In my comments here on Rhapsody 8, I sense I am not far from reaching a critical mass of details that shed light on the unity and integrity of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>.

Both epithets fit Zeus in his role as a thunder-god. The second part of both compounds <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> and <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly derived from <em>keraunós</em> ‘thunder’, and the first part of <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly related to <em>arg</em>‑<em>ós</em> (earlier *<em>argr</em>‑<em>ós</em>) ‘shining, speeding’, but the first part of <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> seems at first unclear. Related forms in other Indo-European languages, however, help elucidate the meaning of <em>terpi</em>‑ as combined with <em>keraunós</em>. In the case of <em>keraunós</em>, we find in the Baltic and Slavic branches of Indo-European the parallel forms <em>perkūnas</em> and <em>perunŭ</em> respectively, both of which are nouns meaning ‘thunder’ and/or ‘god of thunder’. Although the Greek and the Baltic/Slavic roots here, *<em>kerh₂(u̯)</em>‑ and *<em>per(kʷ)</em>‑ respectively, are different in form, they are parallel in meaning, ‘strike’, and the morphology of their suffixation is also parallel. (<em>GMP</em> 194–195). As for the <em>terpi</em>‑ of <em>terpi</em>‑<em>kéraunos</em>, we find a comparable form in the Italic branch of Indo-European: it is the Latin noun <em>quercus</em>, meaning ‘oak tree’. This form, it can be argued, refers to the defining sacred moment when a thunderbolt strikes an oak tree: here the root of the <em>u</em>-stem noun <em>quercus</em>, from *<em>perkʷu‑</em>, is *<em>perkʷ‑</em>, meaning ‘strike’ (<em>GMP</em> 186). So, <em>terpi‑kéraunos</em> can be derived from *<em>kʷerpi-kéraunos</em> via metathesis from *<em>perkʷi-kéraunos</em>.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.2","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073210","title":"Iliad 8.10-8.18","body":"<p>analysis of the third person references to oneself by a speaker in Iliad</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.10-8.18","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073256","title":"Iliad 8.17-8.27","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of diakridon in Hera’s speech in I.15, and comparison with another expression of the same idea in this passage</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.17-8.27","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073319","title":"Iliad 8.22","body":"<p>analysis of the third person references to oneself by a speaker in Iliad</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.22","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073367","title":"Iliad 8.27","body":"<p>analysis of the third person references to oneself by a speaker in Iliad</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.27","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073416","title":"Iliad 8.66-8.77","body":"<p>analysis of the coextensiveness of Zeus’ Will and Achilles’ prayer in his mēnis and their marking by the selas of Zeus/of Hektor at the ships</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.66-8.77","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"selas ‘flash of light’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Will of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"talanta ‘scales’ of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"kḗr ‘cut; slice; portion; fated death’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073485","title":"Iliad 8.78–8.117","body":"<p>(What follows is a general commentary on these verses; what follows after that is an anchor comment on Nestor’s entanglement and the poetics of evocation) </p><p>Seeing the lightning sent by Zeus, I.08.076, the Achaean chieftains are now thunderstruck with fear, I.08.076–077. Mentioned by name at I.08.078–079 as those chieftains who now retreat in terror are Idomeneus, Agamemnon, and the two Ajaxes. Only Nestor, it is said, does not retreat, though not because he does not want to: he simply cannot retreat because his chariot has been immobilized, I.08.080-086. The trace horse of Nestor’s chariot team of three horses has been shot dead by Paris and has fallen down violently to the ground, I.08.080-086. The old hero, drawing his sword, is now struggling to cut himself loose from the <em>parēoriai</em> ‘traces’ that were connected to the fallen horse and that have now entangled the chariot team, I.08.087–088. This trace horse, not named, is analogous to the trace horse of Achilles, named Pedasos, who is killed at a much later point in the <em>Iliad</em>, in a scene of chariot fighting that takes place at I.16.466–476. In that scene, a spear throw by Sarpedon in the course of his chariot fight with Patroklos hits Pedasos instead of Patroklos, I.16.466–468. At I.16.471 and at I.16.474, the narrative there refers to Pedasos explicitly as the <em>parēoros</em> ‘trace horse’ of a three-horse chariot team. As a trace horse, Pedasos is not attached to the yoke that attaches the other two horses to the chariot. This distinction is made clear at a slightly earlier moment, I.16.145–154, leading up to the chariot fight. At this moment, the premier chariot driver of Achilles, Automedon, is harnessing for Patroklos the war chariot of Achilles. On this chariot, Automedon and Patroklos will be riding off together as chariot rider and chariot fighter respectively. At this slightly earlier moment, we see that there are two immortal horses of Achilles, Xanthos and Balios, who are attached to the yoke of the chariot, I.16.148–149, while the mortal trace horse Pedasos is simply connected to the <em>parēoriai</em> ‘traces’, I.16.152. (At this same moment, I.16.153, a significant detail is added about Pedasos: this horse had been captured once upon a time by Achilles when that hero killed the horse’s former owner, who was Eëtion the father of Andromache.) Then, at I.16.466–469, when Pedasos is killed by the spear-throw of Sarpedon and falls violently to the ground, the traces of this trace horse get entangled in the reins connected to the other two horses, I.16.470–471, and Automedon the chariot driver must free himself from the entanglement by drawing his sword and cutting the traces, thus severing the ties to the dead trace horse, Ι.16.472–475. Having noted what will happen in this future action, we now return to the present, I.08.087–088: so, what happens to Nestor as he struggles to cut himself loose from his entanglement? Well, meanwhile, the old hero’s predicament has been spotted by Hector, who is now driving his own chariot at high speed toward Nestor, I.08.088–090, intending to attack him before Nestor can disentangle himself from his disabled chariot. As Hector charges ahead, he is holding on to the reins of his own chariot horses, since he is described at I.08.090 as the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ for the moment, or, to translate the word more literally, as ‘the one who holds on to the reins’. For the moment, then, it is the chariot fighter Hector and not his chariot driver who is here taking the initiative of attempting a high-speed attack on Nestor. Hector is thus taking over here from his own chariot driver, who as we will see later is a hero named Eniopeus and who at this precise moment must be standing next to Hector on the platform of the speeding chariot—but not driving the vehicle himself. This detail about Hector as the momentary chariot driver helps explain what happens later on. Eventually, Hector’s driver Eniopeus will be killed while apparently still standing on the chariot platform: it will happen at I.08.119–124, where Diomedes throws his spear at Hector but hits Eniopeus instead, who dies instantly and falls out of the chariot. In that context, we will see that Eniopeus is now and only now described explicitly as the <em>hēni-okho</em>s ‘chariot driver’, I.08.119. There is an irony here. If Eniopeus and not Hector had been driving the chariot when Diomedes threw his spear, it could have been Hector who got hit and killed. Having noted once again what will happen in the future action, we now return to the present. The Master Narrator goes on to say at I.08.090 that the entanglement of the old hero Nestor would surely have resulted in his death at the hands of Hector—had it not been for the intervention of the young hero Diomedes, I.08.091. Urging Nestor to leave behind his disabled chariot, Diomedes offers him an invitation: let the two heroes ride together on the new chariot of Diomedes and let them now counterattack Hector, I.08.092–112. And let the two <em>theraponte</em> ‘attendants’ meanwhile take away the horses and the chariot of Nestor, taking them back to a zone of safety, I.08.109. The old hero agrees to the invitation, I.08.112. So, the two ‘attendants’ now proceed to take away the chariot team of Nestor, I.08.113, and these two figures are identified here as Sthenelos, chariot driver of Diomedes, and Eurymedon, chariot driver of Nestor, I.08.114. Meanwhile the old hero Nestor joins Diomedes, mounting the platform of the young hero’s chariot. And then he even takes the reins of the chariot of Diomedes in hand and drives the chariot himself, I.08.116–117. So, for the moment, Nestor takes over from Sthenelos as the designated charioteer of Diomedes. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.78-8.117","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"parēoros ‘trace horse’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hēni-okhos ‘chariot driver’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Nestor’s entanglement"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"evocation"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic Cycle"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073542","title":"Iliad 8.078–117/ anchor comment on: Nestor's entanglement and the poetics of evocation","body":"<p>This whole epic narrative about Nestor’s entanglement and his rescue by Diomedes is evocative of another epic narrative where the old hero gets entangled—and gets rescued this time by another young hero, his own son Antilokhos, from the onslaught of another enemy, the chariot fighter Memnon. In this other narrative, however, the son will die in the act of rescuing the father. He will be killed by Memnon. There is a reference to this other epic narrative in a song of Pindar, <em>Pythian</em> 6.28–42. The death of Antilokhos was also narrated in a part of the epic Cycle, the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, as we read in the plot-summary of Proclus p. 106 lines 4-6 (ed. Allen 1912). On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas. And there is a passing reference to the death of Antilokhos in O.04.186–188. That said, it is important to add a clarification: to say that the Iliadic narrative about an entanglement experienced by Nestor is <em>evocative</em> of another epic narrative as found in the epic Cycle is not to say that the <em>Iliad</em> is referring to a pre-existing text. In poetic traditions that stem from an evolving process of recomposition-in-performance, as in the case of Homeric poetry, any act of referencing needs to be viewed in terms of the historical context for any given performance. What can work as a reference in one context may not work so well—or work at all— in some other context. A performance that follows one epic version can refer—however indirectly—to another epic version, but only if those who hear the performance are expected to know both versions. Referencing can be direct, as when Sthenelos the chariot driver of Diomedes refers at I.02.119–130 to the role of these two heroes in the epic traditions of the Epigonoi, that is, The Sons-of-the-Seven-against Thebes. Or referencing can be indirect, as is the case here. The narrative about the entanglement of Nestor and his rescue by Diomedes is sure to have a special effect on those who already know of another narrative about a later entanglement of Nestor that leads to tragic consequences. So, the term <em>evocation</em> suits such indirect referencing. Viewed in this light, <em>evocation</em> in Homeric poetry can be defined simply as <em>a reference made not directly but only indirectly from one traditional context to another</em>. For another evocation of the epic moment when Nestor’s chariot gets entangled and his son Antilokhos gets killed in an effort to save the old hero, see the comment on I.09.057–058.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.78-8.117","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Nestor’s entanglement"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"evocation"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic Cycle"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073609","title":"Iliad 8.079","body":"<p>In contexts where the plural <em>therapontes</em> in combination with <em>Arēos</em> ‘of Ares’ is applied to the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives (here, to the ‘two Ajaxes’) as a grouping of warriors, the deeper meaning is more evident than in other contexts.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.79","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"'the two Ajaxes'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"therapōn 'attendant, ritual substitute'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"therapontes of Ares"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073655","title":"Iliad 8.80-8.91","body":"<p>analysis of the relationship of Nestor and Diomedes (here, Diomedes’ rescuing Nestor)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.80-8.91","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073702","title":"Iliad 8.90-8.98","body":"<p>analysis of the relationship of Nestor and Diomedes, and of Odysseus</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.90-8.98","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073749","title":"Iliad 8.91","body":"<p>contrast between Antilochus and Diomedes in their relationship to/saving of Nestor (noēse) in this passage and Pindar Pythian 6</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.91","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073794","title":"Iliad 8.97","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of esakouein (in this line) as “heed”</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.97","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073841","title":"Iliad 8.99-8.104","body":"<p>analysis of the relationship of Nestor and Diomedes, and comparison of this passage with I.09 where Nestor reminds Diomedes that he is young and so his words have not reached their “goal,” unlike when Nestor then speaks</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.99-8.104","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.073892","title":"Iliad 8.104","body":"<p>Diomedes is speaking to Nestor, saying that the old hero’s chariot driver, unnamed here, has lost his energy and usefulness.

His insulting words recall a scene that took place in their collective epic past, on the island of Lemnos, where the Achaeans were competitively boasting about the exploits they will perform in the future when they fight in the Trojan War. The idea of ‘boasting’ is conveyed by the noun <em>eukhōlē</em>, which is derived from <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’. As we already saw at I.01.091, what is at stake when an Achaean hero boasts in the <em>Iliad</em> centers on the all-important question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The noun <em>eukhōlai</em> ‘boastings’ in the plural here at I.08.229 indicates a distributive action: the Achaeans were boasting not as a group but individually and competitively. The object of such competition and dispute would have been: to show who is the <em>aristos</em> ‘best’ of them all. When Agamemnon says at I.08.229 ‘we were saying that we were best [<em>aristoi</em>]’, the plural construction here is distributive in meaning: ‘each one of us was saying that he was the best [<em>aristos</em>]’. We see in this scene of a past event at Lemnos an epic precedent for what is ongoing in the present time of the Trojan War as narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>. Just as there was a dispute at Lemnos, there is a dispute ongoing in the <em>Iliad</em> about that all-important question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? A most relevant detail in the story about the dispute at Lemnos is the fact that the context for the quarreling that took place at that time over the same question, who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’, was a feast where meat was being distributed, I.08.231. So the setting for the quarrel was an event that is elsewhere called a <em>dais</em>, to be defined as ‘feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’ in Homeric diction. As we saw in the comment for I.01.423–425, a <em>dais</em> is a feast where meat is distributed, and this meat comes from the sacrifice of a sacrificial animal. Thus the act of sacrifice converts the feast of humans into a notional feast of the gods. This notion, ‘feast of the gods’, is made explicit in the “micro-Iliad” of O.8.072–083, which is the First Song of Demodokos. At O.08.076, the setting is described this way: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a sumptuous feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. So, what is happening at this feast? There is a dispute going on (δηρίσαντο at Ο.08.076), and the dispute is called a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075. The disputants are Odysseus and Achilles, who are described at O.08.078 as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. In terms of such a dispute in the context of a feast, each one of the two heroes would be claiming to be the ‘best of the Achaeans’. Similarly in the context of the feast at Lemnos as narrated by Agamemnon, each one of the heroes attending would be making such a claim.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.228-8.235","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"goading by blaming"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"distributive action in the plural"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"micro-Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"First Song of Demodokos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eukhesthai 'declare'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"'best of the Achaeans'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dais 'feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.075832","title":"Iliad 8.229","body":"<p>in a list of instances where phanai substitutes for eukhesthai where it is combined with comparative/superlative</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.229","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.075878","title":"Iliad 8.235","body":"<p>analysis of kēla theoio (as at I.01.053), here, through comparison with puri kēleōi</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.235","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.075924","title":"Iliad 8.237","body":"<p>in a list of passages exemplifying the complementary metrical distribution of eukhos and kudos</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.237","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.075984","title":"Iliad 8.245","body":"<p>in a list of examples of directly quoted prayers not concluded by formula (A)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.245","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.076033","title":"Iliad 8.254","body":"<p>one of Corlu’s examples of eukhesthai referring to past actions</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.254","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.076080","title":"Iliad 8.281","body":"<p>analysis of kephalē as synonym for the whole person (this line as example)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.281","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.076130","title":"Iliad 08.315","body":"<p>At the moment of his death here, the hero’s <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ is released from his body, and, in the present context, the noun <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ is used as a synonym of <em>menos</em>.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:8.315","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"release of consciousness from the body"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"luein ‘release’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"psūkhē 'spirit'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"menos ‘mental power’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.076178","title":"Iliad 8.339","body":"<p>The verb <em>haptesthai</em> ‘grab a hold of’ here at I.08.339 has as its subject a hunting dog that bites and as its object the animal that is bitten by the dog, as we see at I.08.338.
