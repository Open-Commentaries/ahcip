I add a further note here: I translated the plural of <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ here as ‘deeds-of-recklessness’ in order to convey the fact that a singular noun expressing an abstraction can refer to concrete examples of the abstraction when it is used in the plural. So for example <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ is an abstraction, but here at O.01.007 the plural <em>atasthaliai</em> refers to concrete examples of recklessness—in this case, the recklessness is exemplified by the killing and eating of the Cattle of the Sun. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.7","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"atasthaliā ‘recklessness’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Will of Zeus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188856","title":"Odyssey 1","body":"<p>The comments I offer on <em>Odyssey</em> Rhapsody 1 through Rhapsody 24, starting here with Rhapsody 1, were based mostly on details that derive from seven books that I indicate in the Bibliography by way of these abbreviations: BA, GMP, H24H, HC, HPC, HQ, HR, MoM, PasP, PH.

My colleague Anita Nikkanen, an Associate Editor for this online project, tracked the sequences of Homeric verses as listed in the indices for six of these books and then summarized my comments on those verses. Following up on her meticulous work, I am in the process of converting her summaries into a form of commentary. My comments on the <em>Odyssey</em> as I presented them in <em>Classical Inquiries</em> are merely samplings of the content that I hope to contribute to the overall commentary, to which a number of other colleagues are also contributing their own comments.

The main theme of the <em>Odyssey</em> is signaled right away. The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the epic. This word is the noun <em>andra</em> ‘man’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>anēr</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ here marks this noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’, O.01.001. The Master Narrator is addressing a goddess who is the Muse of the <em>Odyssey</em>, asking the goddess to narrate for him the story of a man who is not yet named as Odysseus. The ‘man’ is the subject of the story. In other words, he is the subject of the narration, or the <em>narrative subject</em>. And this <em>narrative subject</em> is the<em> grammatical object</em> of the verb <em>ennepein</em>, meaning ‘narrate, tell’. Similarly at the beginning of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, as analyzed at I.01.001–012, the narrative subject is the first word in the very first verse. That word is the noun <em>mēnin</em> ‘anger’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>mēnis</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>mēnis</em> there marks that noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’, I.01.110. There the Master Narrator is addressing a <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’ who is the Muse of the <em>Iliad</em>, asking that goddess to sing for him that anger, I.01.001. The song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. That song is The Song of the Anger, in the sense that the anger <em>is</em> the song. The anger is the narrative subject. Similarly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the Master Narrator calls on the Muse of the Odyssey to ‘narrate the man’, that is, to ‘tell the song of the man’. Here too the song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. This song is The Song of the Man, in that the man <em>is</em> the song. The man is the narrative subject. And the song captures the total reality of the man. </p><p>Point 2.</p><p>But this reality is not so easy to capture, since the man who is Odysseus is many-sided, as we will now see. Odysseus at O.01.001 is <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’. This translation makes explicit what is only implied in an alternative way of rendering this elusive word, ‘versatile in many ways’ (H24H 0§21, also 9§4, also 10§2), where the Latin root <em>vert</em>- ‘turn’ of the Latinate word <em>versatile</em> can mean not only ‘turn around’ but also ‘turn into a different self’, as we see most clearly in the Latin word for ‘werewolf’, <em>versi</em>-<em>pellis</em>, which literally means ‘he whose skin has turned’ (Pliny <em>Natural History</em> 8.34; Petronius 62; details in GMP 264–265). Similarly, <em>polutropos</em> applies to <em>a figure who is different at every turn</em>, and who becomes different many times and in many ways. That is why the ultimate shape-shifter, the god Hermes, is <em>polutropos</em> in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> (verses 13, 439). And that is why, in the only other context where Odysseus is described as <em>polutropos</em>, O.10.330, he is associated in that context with his polytropic model, Hermes himself, O.10.331–332. (Further commentary in GMP 34.) Since Odysseus can turn into something different at every turn, the multiplicity of angles to be seen at every turn helps explain why this hero will not yet be named at the beginning of the Odyssey. </p><p>Point 3.</p><p>There is still more to be said about this adjective <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ describing Odysseus at O.01.001: it is used here as an <em>epithet for the narrative subject</em>, which in this case is <em>anēr</em> ‘man’. Another such epithet is the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ describing the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles at I.01.002. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.1-1.10","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"andra [grammatical object of anēr] ‘man’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Muse"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Master Narrator"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"narrative subject as grammatical object"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ennepein 'narrate, tell'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"polutropos 'turning-into-many-different-selves'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"epithet for narrative subject"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"singing as narrating"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Theme"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.188977","title":"Odyssey 1.1-1.4","body":"<p>The multiplicity to be seen in the shape-shifting figure of Odysseus is poeticized by way of repeating the element <em>pol(l)-</em> ‘many’ of <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’, spilling over from O.01.001 into O.01.003–004: <strong>πολύ</strong>τροπον πολλὰ |…|<strong>πολλ</strong>ῶν… |<strong>πολλ</strong>ά.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.1-1.4","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"poetics of multiplicity"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.189034","title":"Odyssey 1.1-2","body":"<p>We have seen that the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> as designated by the driving word <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the accusative, <em>andra</em> at O.01.001, used here as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’.

On the meaning ‘song of homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.326–327. On <em>kleos</em> in the sense of an overall reference to the ‘glory’ of poetry, see the comment on I.02.325. Here at O.01.088–095, we can see that <em>nostos</em> as a ‘song of homecoming’ is a prerequisite for the quest of Odysseus to achieve the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry. Odysseus will receive the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of his own <em>Odyssey</em> only if he achieves a successful <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, and it is the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry that turns his <em>homecoming</em> into a <em>song of homecoming</em>. What the goddess says at O.01.094 is not that Telemachus will learn <em>about</em> the <em>nostos</em> of Odysseus if he is fortunate enough to hear <em>about</em> it. In the original Greek text, the noun <em>nostos</em> is the direct object of both the verb <em>punthanesthai</em>, ‘learn’ and the verb <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’ at O.01.094 here, and that is why I chose to translate the verse this way: ‘and thus he will learn [<em>punthanesthai</em>] the return [<em>nostos</em>] of his dear [<em>philos</em>] father, if by chance he [= Telemachus] hears [<em>akouein</em>] it’. Elsewhere too in the <em>Odyssey</em>, we see nostos as the direct object of <em>punthanesthai</em> ‘learn’: O.02.215, O.02.264, O.02.360, O.04.714—as also of <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’: O.01.287, O.02.218, O.02.360. It is not a question of learning <em>about</em> a homecoming, of hearing <em>about</em> a homecoming. Rather, Telemachus will learn the actual song of the homecoming, the song of <em>nostos</em>, by hearing it. He will actually hear the song from the hero Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and from the hero Menelaos along with his divine consort Helen in <em>Odyssey</em> 4.

At a council of the gods, the goddess Athena declares her intention to go to Ithaca to become a mentor to the young hero Telemachus, O.01.088–089. Descending from Olympus and landing in Ithaca, the goddess assumes the human form of a fatherly hero named <em>Méntēs</em>, O.01.105, who proceeds to give wise advice to the young hero. In a subsequent intervention, O.02.268, the goddess will assume the human form of another fatherly hero, named <em>Méntōr</em>, and, as in the present intervention, this other father-substitute will likewise proceed to give wise advice to the young hero. These two names <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em> are both related to the noun <em>menos</em>, which I translate as ‘mental power’. This word, as we can see here at O.01.089, refers to the heroic ‘power’ that the goddess Athena says she will put into Telemachus. The noun <em>menos</em>, usually translated as ‘power’ or ‘strength’, is derived from the verb-root <em>mnē-</em>, meaning ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113). Likewise derived from this verb-root are the agent nouns <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em>, which both mean ‘he who connects mentally’. When a divinity connects a hero to his heroic mentality, the hero will have <em>menos</em>, that is, ‘power’ or ‘strength’. To have heroic power or strength, you have to have a heroic mentality.

Such a singer is not exactly the equivalent of a “court poet,” since Phemios is singing for the suitors against his will, that is, he is singing <em>anankēi</em> ‘by way of constraint’, O.01.154. And what kind of a singer is this Phemios? He sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055. In Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, Phemios is described as a <em>rhapsōidos</em> ‘rhapsode’. The description is accurate in the sense that rhapsodes were professional performers of Homeric poetry in the classical period, as we see clearly in the overall context of Plato’s <em>Ion</em>. But this same description is inaccurate in the sense that rhapsodes in the classical period performed Homeric poetry without accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’: as we see overall in Plato’s <em>Ion</em> and elsewhere, the rhapsodic form of ‘singing’ Homeric poetry was basically <em>recitative</em>, with reduced melody. By contrast, as we read in Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, performers in the classical period who sang with full-blown melody while accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’ were called <em>kitharōidoi</em> ‘citharodes’, that is, <em>‘kitharā-singers’</em>. In other words, these ‘lyre-singers’ were performers of what we call <em>lyric</em>. At the festival of the Panathenaia in Athens during the classical period, these lyre-singers or citharodes competed with each other in singing <em>lyric</em>, while rhapsodes competed with each other in singing <em>epic</em>. As we can learn from Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, the prototypical citharode was considered to be Orpheus, while the prototypical rhapsode was Phemios. But Phemios, even though he sings epic and not lyric, is not exactly a rhapsode in the classical sense of the term: as I have already pointed out, Phemios sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055.

Πηνελόπεια is a <em>nom parlant</em> and signals Penelope's belonging to a thematically related group of women in myth. The name was perceived as significant in antiquity and a linguistically unobjectionable derivation from the name of a bird, πηνέλοψ, was known to Didymus (as attested by Eustathius' <em>Commentarii ad Homeri Odysseam</em> 1.65.36). The etymology of the word πηνέλοψ itself is obscure beyond the second part of the compound, derived from the *h<sub>3</sub>ek<sup>ṷ</sup> root and meaning \"looking (like)\" (Chantraine 2009, s.v. ὄπωπα, πηνέλοψ). Nevertheless, the relevance of the <em>penelops</em> to Penelope can be ascertained. The <em>penelops</em> appears to be a bird similar to a halcyon. According to Aristotle <em>Historia Animalium (</em>593b23) the <em>penelops</em> is a small waterbird and lives at sea. <em>Penelopes</em> are mentioned together with halcyons in Aristophanes <em>Birds</em> 298 and Ibycus fr. 317a PMG. In the latter fragment, <em>penelopes</em> are described as ποικίλαι (2), αἰολόδειροι (2), and possibly also ἁλιπορφυρίδες (3), if Schneidewin's reconstruction is correct (Schneidewin 1833.128-131). <em>Penelopes</em> are said to be ποικιλόδειροι and τανυσίπτεροι in Alcaeus 345 L-P.2. Of these epithets the <em>penelops</em> shares with the halcyon ποικίλος ‘of varied color’ and τανυσίπτερος ‘long-winged’. If ἁλιπορφυρίδες is correctly restored, then this too allies the <em>penelops</em> to the halcyon, which is described by the rare epithet ἁλιπόρφυρος in Alcman 26 PMG.4. The <em>penelops</em> in Alcaeus 345 L-P. and the halcyon in Alcman 26 PMG are represented as (respectively) flying over the waves and coming from Okeanos. In poetry and myth, the (female) halcyon characteristically faithful to her mate, laments when the mate is lost, and is tied to the solar symbolism of death and rebirth (e.g. Alcman 26 PMG, Simonides 508 PMG, Aristotle, <em>Historia Animalium</em> 8.542b4, Dionysius, <em>De Avibus</em> 2.7, Plutarch <em>On the Intelligence of Animals </em> 983a). These features are shared by a mythological character whose name derives from the name of the bird, Alkyone, the wife of Keyx (Hesiod, fr. 10a.94-96 M, fr. 10d MW, Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em> 11.410-748, Ps.-Apollodorus 1.7.4). Alkyone is a woman dominated by faithfulness to her husband, for whom she laments and finally dies when he departs on a long sea voyage and does not return. Just as Penelope's story is morphologically similar to that of Alkyone, so are the two birds that give them their names. Being similar to the halcyon, the <em>penelops</em> is a fitting match for Penelope, among whose dominant features are faithfulness to her husband and lament for him while he is absent. An argument has also been made that Penelope takes part in the operation of the overarching solar metaphor in the <em>Odyssey</em> (Levaniouk 2011:298-312). The similarities between the two myths parallel those between the two bird-named women and also those between the two birds. The connections appear to be systemic rather than accidental. Penelope and Alkyone have further points of contact with yet another woman with a bird's name, Aedon the nightingale, to whom Penelope compares herself in <em>Odyssey</em> 19.518. Penelope and Alkyone are closer to each other than to Aedon, though all three share key features, the most important being their laments. In the same way, <em>penelops</em> and halcyon are more similar to each other than to the nightingale, but both have associations with the latter. Both ποικιλόδειρος and αἰολόδειρος (the epithets of the <em>penelops</em> in Alcaeus and Ibycus respectively) are epithets of the nightingale (Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 203; Nonnus <em>Dionysiaca</em> 26.211). In Ibycus’ fragment <em>penelopes</em> and halcyons are represented as sitting πετάλοισιν ἐπ' ἀκροτάτοις ‘on the topmost leaves’, literally ‘petals’, a <em>topos</em> about the nightingale (<em>Odyssey</em> xix 520, <em>Homeric Hymn to Pan</em> 17-18, <em>Anthologia Palatina</em> 12.2.3, 12.136.3). Since the halcyon's voice is described in the same terms as that of the nightingale and since, like the nightingale, the halcyon is imagined as a woman transformed into a bird and forever lamenting, it is likely that the <em>penelops</em> too is a bird of lament similar to the nightingale and the halcyon and that, as with the nightingale (Nagy 196:59n.1), the compounds with -δειρος applied to it (ποικιλόδειρος and αἰολόδειρος) signify the quality of its voice rather than the color of its neck.

As I argue in Nagy 2015.09.24§§36–37, what we see in these variant verses is a trace of a Cretan Odyssey as primarily represented in our <em>Odyssey</em> by the “Cretan lies,” which are micro-narratives embedded in the epic macro-narrative of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>. In comments forthcoming, there will be more to say about these “Cretan lies.” Here I confine my comments to points that are relevant to what we read at O.01.093 and O.01.284–286. In “our” <em>Odyssey</em>, as Nestor reports at O.03.191–192, Idomeneus after the Trojan War returns to Crete with all his men safe and sound. In the Cretan Odyssey, by contrast, Idomeneus seems to have traveled with Odysseus after the conquest of Troy by the Achaeans, and this king of the Cretans even experienced, together with Odysseus, the horrors of the Cave of the Cyclops: such a story about joint adventures experienced by Idomeneus and Odysseus is attested in a painting on a red-figure stamnos, 480 BCE, featuring the name-tags ΙΔΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ ‘Ida-meneus’ [sic] and ΟΔΥΣΥΣ ‘Odusus’ [sic] appended to images of these two heroes, showing each one of the two clinging to a ram’s underbelly (Levaniouk 2011:105). </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.284-1.286","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Zenodotus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Cretan Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"Cretan lies\""},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Aristarchus"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.192217","title":"Odyssey 1.299","body":"<p>This expression <em>ep’ anthrōpous </em>‘throughout humankind’ is conventionally associated with words referring to remembrance by way of song.

The idea of <em>menos</em> as ‘mental power’ is elegantly recapitulated here at O.01.320–321. The goddess Athena has just finished the first phase of her role as mentor to Telemachus. She had initiated this phase at O.01.088–089 after having assumed, as we saw at O.01.105, the human shape of the fatherly <em>Méntēs</em>. This name <em>Méntēs</em>, as I indicated in the comment on O.01.088–089, means ‘he who connects mentally’. Having finished with the role of <em>Méntēs</em>, the goddess now transforms herself into a bird and flies out of the palace through a lightwell on the roof, and what we see here at O.01.320–321 is the wording that describes what Athena had accomplished so far in connecting the mind of Telemachus with the mind of his father. In her role as <em>Méntēs</em>, ‘he who connects mentally’, the goddess has given to the hero Telemachus the <em>menos</em> or ‘mental power’ of connecting with the heroic identity of his father. That act of doing this is expressed here at O.01.321 by the verb<em> hupo-mnē-</em>, which means literally ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113).

The epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 for the narrative subject <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative here: Athena caused misfortune for some of the Achaeans. Similarly, the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> at I.01.002 for the narrative subject <em>mēnis</em> at I.01.001 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable misfortune. See the comment on I.01.002. Also, the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 for the preceding narrative subject <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the same verse is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: the hero Odysseus suffered many misfortunes by veering many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.326-1.327","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"epithet for narrative subject"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"nostos 'homecoming, song of homecoming'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"relative clause as introductory outline of the overall narrative"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"lugros 'disastrous'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.192633","title":"Odyssey 1.338","body":"<p>To sing the kind of song that the singer Phemios sings—the song is called <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song about of homecoming’ at O.01.326—is described here at O.01.338 as an act of transforming the <em>erga</em> ‘deeds’ of men and gods into the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry.

There is a pleasure in the hearing of such a song, Telemachus says at O.01.346–347. Evidently, he does not yet understand the personal involvement of Penelope in the story of such homecoming—or of course his own involvement—because he does not yet understand that the ultimate character in the ultimate story of homecoming will be Odysseus himself. Telemachus speaks positively about the reception of the song of homecoming as sung by the singer Phemios. He says that the audience gives glory to the song, and the verb that is used in his wording is <em>epi-kleiein</em> at O.01.351, which I translate as ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’. I render the <em>epi</em>- of <em>epi-kleiein</em> here as ‘and pass it on’, in the sense that <em>epi</em>- conveys the idea of ‘in addition to, on top of’, supplementing -<em>kleiein</em> in the sense of ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>]’. The wording of Telemachus is justifiable to the extent that the glory of heroes and gods as produced by the singer produces also glory for the song itself as received by the audience. That is to say, this verb <em>epi-kleiein</em> ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’ is reciprocal: there is not only the giving of glory by the audience to the song sung by the singer but there is also the giving of glory by the singer to the song that he sings. Thus it is justifiable for Telemachus to say that the greatest glory goes to the <em>aoidē</em> ‘song‘, O.01.351, that is <em>neōtatē</em> ‘newest’, O.01.352, since the glory to be transmitted must be the latest glory to be received. The reception by the most recent audience must be decisively successful. What Telemachus does not yet understand, however, is that the most recent audience for an ongoing song of homecoming will be not the suitors but the ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>. The audience of the <em>Odyssey</em> will be the definitive audience for the reception of this ongoing song of homecoming. And, for that ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the ultimate hero of the song of homecoming will be Odysseus himself.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.346-1.352","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"epi-kleiein 'turn [deeds] into glory [kleos] and pass it on'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.192852","title":"Odyssey 1.378-1.379","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of epidōsometh’ in I.10.463 and its variant reading epibōsometh’</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:1.378-1.379","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.192899","title":"Odyssey 1.383","body":"<p>Here we see for the first time the leader of the suitors.
