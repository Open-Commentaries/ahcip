About his shoulder he slung his sharp sword, and beneath his shining feet bound his fair sandals,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"5\" unit=\"line\"/>and went forth from his chamber like a god to look upon. Straightway he bade the clear-voiced heralds to summon to the assembly the long-haired Achaeans. And the heralds made the summons, and the Achaeans assembled full quickly. Now when they were assembled and met together,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>Telemachus went his way to the place of assembly, holding in his hand a spear of bronze—not alone, for along with him two swift hounds followed; and wondrous was the grace that Athena shed upon him, and all the people marvelled at him as he came. But he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave place.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"15\" unit=\"line\"/>Then among them the lord Aegyptius was the first to speak, a man bowed with age and wise with wisdom untold. Now he spoke, because his dear son had gone in the hollow ships to Ilius, famed for its horses, in the company of godlike Odysseus, even the warrior Antiphus. But him the savage <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName> had slain<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"20\" unit=\"line\"/>in his hollow cave, and made of him his latest meal. Three others there were; one, Eurynomus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept their father's farm. Yet, even so, he could not forget that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"25\" unit=\"line\"/>“Hearken now to me, men of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, to the word that I shall say. Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. And now who has called us together?

Nay verily, even if I try I shall be found a weakling and one knowing naught of valor.

Thus for three years she by her craft kept the Achaeans from knowing, and beguiled them; but when the fourth year came as the seasons rolled on, even then one of her women who knew all told us, and we caught her unravelling the splendid web.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"110\" unit=\"line\"/>So she finished it against her will, perforce.
