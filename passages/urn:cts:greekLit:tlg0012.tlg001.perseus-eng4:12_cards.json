They had built it to protect their ships, and had dug\n    the trench all round it that it might safeguard both the ships and the rich\n    spoils which they had taken, but they had not offered hecatombs to the gods. It\n    had been built without the consent of the immortals, and therefore it did not\n    last. So long as Hektor lived and Achilles continued his anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>], and so long as the city of Priam remained\n    untaken, the great wall of the Achaeans stood firm; but when the bravest of the\n    Trojans were no more, and many also of the Argives, though some were yet left\n    alive when, moreover, the city was sacked in the tenth year, and the Argives\n    had gone back with their ships to their own country - then Poseidon and Apollo\n    took counsel to destroy the wall, and they turned on to it the streams of all\n    the rivers from <placeName key=\"tgn,1105013\">Mount Ida</placeName> into the\n    sea, Rhesus, Heptaporos, Caresus, Rhodios, Grenicus, Aesopos, and goodly\n    Skamandros, with Simoeis, where many a shield and helm had fallen, and many a\n    hero of the race of demigods had bitten the dust. Phoebus Apollo turned the\n    mouths of all these rivers together and made them flow for nine days against\n    the wall, while Zeus rained the whole time that he might wash it sooner into\n    the sea. Poseidon himself, trident in hand, surveyed the work and threw into\n    the sea all the foundations of beams and stones which the Achaeans had laid\n    with so much toil;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"29\" unit=\"line\"/>he made all level by the mighty stream of the\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7002638\">Hellespont</placeName>, and then when he had\n    swept the wall away he spread a great beach of sand over the place where it had\n    been. This done he turned the rivers back into their old courses. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"34\" unit=\"line\"/>This was what Poseidon and Apollo were to do in\n    after time; but as yet battle and turmoil were still raging round the wall till\n    its timbers rang under the blows that rained upon them. The Argives, cowed by\n    the scourge of Zeus, were hemmed in at their ships in fear of Hektor the mighty\n    minister of Rout, who as heretofore fought with the force and fury of a\n    whirlwind. As a lion or wild boar turns fiercely on the dogs and men that\n    attack him, while these form solid wall and shower their javelins as they face\n    him - his courage is all undaunted, but his high spirit will be the death of\n    him; many a time does he charge at his pursuers to scatter them, and they fall\n    back as often as he does so - even so did Hektor go about among the host\n    exhorting his men, and cheering them on to cross the trench. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"50\" unit=\"line\"/>But the horses dared not do so, and stood\n    neighing upon its brink, for the width frightened them. They could neither jump\n    it nor cross it, for it had overhanging banks all round upon either side, above\n    which there were the sharp stakes that the sons of the Achaeans had planted so\n    close and strong as a defense against all who would assail it; a horse,\n    therefore, could not get into it and draw his chariot after him, but those who\n    were on foot kept trying their very utmost. Then Polydamas went up to Hektor\n    and said, \"Hektor, and you other leaders of the Trojans and allies, it is\n    madness for us to try and drive our horses across the trench; it will be very\n    hard to cross, for it is full of sharp stakes, and beyond these there is the\n    wall. Our horses therefore cannot get down into it, and would be of no use if\n    they did; moreover it is a narrow place and we should come to harm. If, indeed,\n    great Zeus is minded to help the Trojans, and in his anger will utterly destroy\n    the Achaeans,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"69\" unit=\"line\"/>I would myself gladly see them perish now and\n    here far from <placeName key=\"perseus,Argos\">Argos</placeName>; but if they\n    should rally and we are driven back from the ships pell-mell into the trench\n    there will be not so much as a man get back to the city to tell the tale. Now,\n    therefore, let us all do as I say; let our squires [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapontes</term>] hold our horses by the trench, but let us follow Hektor\n    in a body on foot, clad in full armor, and if the day of their doom is at hand\n    the Achaeans will not be able to withstand us.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"80\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus spoke Polydamas and his saying pleased\n    Hektor, who sprang in full armor to the ground, and all the other Trojans, when\n    they saw him do so, also left their chariots. Each man then gave his horses\n    over to his charioteer in charge to hold them ready, in proper order [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>], for him at the trench. Then they formed\n    themselves into companies, made themselves ready, and in five bodies followed\n    their leaders. Those that went with Hektor and Polydamas were the bravest and\n    most in number, and the most determined to break through the wall and fight at\n    the ships. Kebriones was also joined with them as third in command, for Hektor\n    had left his chariot in charge of a less valiant warrior. The next company was\n    led by <placeName key=\"tgn,7008038\">Paris</placeName>, Alkathoos, and Agenor;\n    the third by Helenos and Deiphobos, two sons of Priam, and with them was the\n    hero Asios - Asios the son of Hyrtakos, whose great black horses of the breed\n    that comes from the river Selleis had brought him from Arisbe. Aeneas the\n    valiant son of Anchises led the fourth; he and the two sons of Antenor,\n    Arkhelokhos and Akamas, men well versed in all the arts of war. Sarpedon was\n    leader over the allies, and took with him Glaukos and Asteropaios whom he\n    deemed most valiant after himself - for he was far the best man of them all.\n    These helped to array one another in their ox-hide shields, and then charged\n    straight at the Danaans, for they felt sure that they would not hold out longer\n    and that they should themselves now fall upon the ships. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"108\" unit=\"line\"/>The rest of the Trojans and their allies now\n    followed the counsel of Polydamas but Asios son of Hyrtakos would not leave his\n    horses and his esquire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] behind him; in\n    his foolhardiness he took them on with him towards the ships, nor did he fail\n    to come by his end in consequence. Nevermore was he to return to wind-beaten\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, exulting in his chariot and\n    his horses; ere he could do so, death of ill-omened name had overshadowed him\n    and he had fallen by the spear of Idomeneus the noble son of Deukalion. He had\n    driven towards the left wing of the ships, by which way the Achaeans used to\n    return with their chariots and horses from the plain. Hither he drove and found\n    the gates with their doors opened wide, and the great bar down - for the\n    gatemen kept them open so as to let those of their comrades enter who might be\n    fleeing towards the ships. Hither of set purpose did he direct his horses, and\n    his men followed him with a loud cry, for they felt sure that the Achaeans\n    would not hold out longer, and that they should now fall upon the ships. Little\n    did they know that at the gates they should find two of the bravest chieftains,\n    proud sons of the fighting Lapiths - the one, Polypoites, mighty son of\n    Peirithoos, and the other Leonteus, peer of murderous Ares. These stood before\n    the gates like two high oak trees upon the mountains, that tower from their\n    wide-spreading roots, and year after year battle with wind and rain - even so\n    did these two men await the onset of great Asios confidently and without\n    flinching. The Trojans led by him and by Iamenos, Orestes, Adamas the son of\n    Asios, Thoon and Oinomaos, raised a loud cry of battle and made straight for\n    the wall, holding their shields of dry ox-hide above their heads; for a while\n    the two defenders remained inside and cheered the Achaeans on to stand firm in\n    the defense of their ships; when, however, they saw that the Trojans were\n    attacking the wall, while the Danaans were crying out for help and being\n    routed, they rushed outside and fought in front of the gates like two wild\n    boars upon the mountains that abide the attack of men and dogs, and charging on\n    either side break down the wood all round them tearing it up by the roots,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"149\" unit=\"line\"/>and one can hear the clattering of their tusks,\n    till some one hits them and makes an end of them - even so did the gleaming\n    bronze rattle about their breasts, as the weapons fell upon them; for they\n    fought with great fury, trusting to their own prowess and to those who were on\n    the wall above them. These threw great stones at their assailants in defense of\n    themselves their tents and their ships. The stones fell thick as the flakes of\n    snow which some fierce blast drives from the dark clouds and showers down in\n    sheets upon the earth - even so fell the weapons from the hands alike of\n    Trojans and Achaeans. Helmet and shield rang out as the great stones rained\n    upon them, and Asios the son of Hyrtakos in his dismay cried aloud and smote\n    his two thighs. \"Father Zeus,\" he cried, \"of a truth you too are altogether\n    given to lying. I made sure the <placeName key=\"tgn,5001993\">Argive</placeName>\n    heroes could not withstand us, whereas like slim-waisted wasps, or bees that\n    have their nests in the rocks by the wayside - they leave not the holes wherein\n    they have built undefended, but fight for their little ones against all who\n    would take them - even so these men, though they be but two, will not be driven\n    from the gates, but stand firm either to slay or be slain.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"172"},{"n":"172","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"172\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"172\" unit=\"line\"/>He spoke, but moved not the mind of Zeus, whose\n    counsel it then was to give glory to Hektor. Meanwhile the rest of the Trojans\n    were fighting about the other gates; I, however, am no god to be able to tell\n    about all these things, for the battle raged everywhere about the stone wall as\n    it were a fiery furnace. The Argives, discomfited though they were, were forced\n    to defend their ships, and all the gods who were defending the Achaeans were\n    vexed in spirit; but the Lapiths kept on fighting with might and main. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"182\" unit=\"line\"/>Thereon Polypoites, mighty son of Peirithoos,\n    hit Damasos with a spear upon his cheek-pierced helmet. The helmet did not\n    protect him, for the point of the spear went through it, and broke the bone, so\n    that the brain inside was scattered about, and he died fighting. He then slew\n    Pylon and Ormenus. Leonteus, of the race of Ares, killed Hippomakhos the son of\n    Antimakhos by striking him with his spear upon the belt. He then drew his sword\n    and sprang first upon Antiphates whom he killed in combat, and who fell face\n    upwards on the earth. After him he killed Menon, Iamenos, and Orestes, and laid\n    them low one after the other. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"195\" unit=\"line\"/>While they were busy stripping the armor from\n    these heroes, the youths who were led on by Polydamas and Hektor (and these\n    were the greater part and the most valiant of those that were trying to break\n    through the wall and fire the ships) were still standing by the trench,\n    uncertain what they should do; for they had seen a sign from heaven when they\n    had essayed to cross it - a soaring eagle that flew skirting the left wing of\n    their host, with a monstrous blood-red snake in its talons still alive and\n    struggling to escape. The snake was still bent on revenge, wriggling and\n    twisting itself backwards till it struck the bird that held it, on the neck and\n    breast; whereon the bird being in pain, let it fall, dropping it into the\n    middle of the host, and then flew down the wind with a sharp cry. The Trojans\n    were struck with terror when they saw the snake, portent of aegis-bearing Zeus,\n    writhing in the midst of them, and Polydamas went up to Hektor and said,\n    \"Hektor, at our councils of war you are ever given to rebuke me, even when I\n    speak wisely, as though it were not well, indeed, that one of the people of the\n    local district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] should cross your will\n    either in the field or at the council board; you would have them support you\n    always: nevertheless I will say what I think will be best; let us not now go on\n    to fight the Danaans at their ships, for I know what will happen if this\n    soaring eagle which skirted the left wing of our with a monstrous blood-red\n    snake in its talons (the snake being still alive) was really sent as an omen to\n    the Trojans on their essaying to cross the trench.

Thus would any seer who was expert in these matters,\n    and was trusted by the people, read the portent.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"230\" unit=\"line\"/>Hektor looked fiercely at him and said,\n    \"Polydamas, I like not of your reading. You can find a better saying than this\n    if you will. If, however, you have spoken in good earnest, then indeed has\n    heaven robbed you of your reason. You would have me pay no heed to the counsels\n    of Zeus, nor to the promises he made me - and he bowed his head in\n    confirmation; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild-fowl. What care\n    I whether they flee towards dawn or dark, and whether they be on my right hand\n    or on my left? Let us put our trust rather in the counsel of great Zeus, king\n    of mortals and immortals. There is one omen, and one only - that a man should\n    fight for his country. Why are you so fearful? Though we be all of us slain at\n    the ships of the Argives you are not likely to be killed yourself, for you are\n    not steadfast nor courageous.

Then Zeus the lord of thunder sent\n    the blast of a mighty wind from the mountains of Ida, that bore the dust down\n    towards the ships; he thus lulled the thinking [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] of the Achaeans into security, and gave victory to Hektor and\n    to the Trojans, who, trusting to their own might and to the signs he had shown\n    them, essayed to break through the great wall of the Achaeans. They tore down\n    the breastworks from the walls, and overthrew the battlements; they upheaved\n    the buttresses, which the Achaeans had set in front of the wall in order to\n    support it; when they had pulled these down they made sure of breaking through\n    the wall, but the Danaans still showed no sign of giving ground; they still\n    fenced the battlements with their shields of ox-hide, and hurled their missiles\n    down upon the foe as soon as any came below the wall. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"265\" unit=\"line\"/>The two Ajaxes went about everywhere on the\n    walls cheering on the Achaeans, giving fair words to some while they spoke\n    sharply to any one whom they saw to be remiss. \"My friends,\" they cried,\n    \"Argives one and all - good bad and indifferent, for there was never fight yet,\n    in which all were of equal prowess - there is now work enough, as you very well\n    know, for all of you.

Menestheus son of Peteos was dismayed\n    when he saw them, for it was against his part of the wall that they came -\n    bringing destruction with them; he looked along the wall for some chieftain to\n    support his comrades and saw the two Ajaxes, men ever eager for the fray, and\n    Teucer, who had just come from his tent, standing near them; but he could not\n    make his voice heard by shouting to them, so great an uproar was there from\n    crashing shields and helmets and the battering of gates with a din which\n    reached the skies. For all the gates had been closed, and the Trojans were\n    hammering at them to try and break their way through them. Menestheus,\n    therefore, sent Thoötes with a message to Ajax. \"Run, good Thoötes,\" said and\n    call Ajax, or better still bid both come, for it will be all over with us here\n    directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon us, men who have ever fought\n    desperately heretofore. But if the have too much trouble [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] on their hands to let them come, at any rate let Ajax son of\n    Telamon do so, and let Teucer the famous bowman come with him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"351\" unit=\"line\"/>The messenger did as he was told, and set off\n    running along the wall of the Achaeans. When he reached the Ajaxes he said to\n    them, \"Sirs, princes of the Argives, the son of noble Peteos bids you come to\n    him for a while and help him. You had better both come if you can, or it will\n    be all over with him directly; the leaders of the Lycians are upon him, men who\n    have ever fought desperately heretofore; if you have too much on your hands to\n    let both come, at any rate let Ajax son of Telamon do so, and let Teucer the\n    famous bowman come with him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"364\" unit=\"line\"/>Great Ajax, son of Telamon, heeded the message,\n    and at once spoke to the son of Oileus. \"Ajax,\" said he, \"do you two, yourself\n    and brave Lykomedes, stay here and keep the Danaans in heart to fight their\n    hardest.

They went along inside the wall, and when they came to the tower where\n    Menestheus was (and hard pressed indeed did they find him) the brave leaders\n    and leaders of the Lycians were storming the battlements as it were a thick\n    dark cloud, fighting in close quarters, and raising the battle-cry aloud. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"378\" unit=\"line\"/>First, Ajax son of Telamon killed brave\n    Epikles, a comrade of Sarpedon, hitting him with a jagged stone that lay by the\n    battlements at the very top of the wall. As men now are, even one who is in the\n    bloom of youth could hardly lift it with his two hands, but Ajax raised it high\n    aloft and flung it down, smashing Epikles' four-crested helmet so that the\n    bones of his head were crushed to pieces, and he fell from the high wall as\n    though he were diving, with no more life left in him. Then Teucer wounded\n    Glaukos the brave son of Hippolokhos as he was coming on to attack the wall. He\n    saw his shoulder bare and aimed an arrow at it, which made Glaukos leave off\n    fighting. Thereon he sprang covertly down for fear some of the Achaeans might\n    see that he was wounded and taunt him. Sarpedon was stung with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] when he saw Glaukos leave him, still he did not\n    leave off fighting, but aimed his spear at Alkmaon the son of Thestor and hit\n    him. He drew his spear back again Alkmaon came down headlong after it with his\n    bronzed armor rattling round him. Then Sarpedon seized the battlement in his\n    strong hands, and tugged at it till it an gave way together, and a breach was\n    made through which many might pass. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"400\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax and Teucer then both of them attacked him.\n    Teucer hit him with an arrow on the band that bore the shield which covered his\n    body, but Zeus saved his son from destruction that he might not fall by the\n    ships' sterns. Meanwhile Ajax sprang on him and pierced his shield, but the\n    spear did not go clean through, though it hustled him back that he could come\n    on no further. He therefore retired a little space from the battlement, yet\n    without losing all his ground, for he still thought to cover himself with\n    glory. Then he turned round and shouted to the brave Lycians saying, \"Lycians,\n    why do you thus fail me? For all my prowess I cannot break through the wall and\n    open a way to the ships single-handed.

The Argives on their part\n    got their men in fighting order within the wall, and there was a deadly\n    struggle between them. The Lycians could not break through the wall and force\n    their way to the ships, nor could the Danaans drive the Lycians from the wall\n    now that they had once reached it. As two men, measuring-rods in hand, quarrel\n    about their boundaries in a field that they own in common, and stickle for\n    their rights though they be but in a mere strip, even so did the battlements\n    now serve as a bone of contention, and they beat one another's round shields\n    for their possession. Many a man's body was wounded with the pitiless bronze,\n    as he turned round and bared his back to the foe, and many were struck clean\n    through their shields; the wall and battlements were everywhere deluged with\n    the blood alike of Trojans and of Achaeans. But even so the Trojans could not\n    rout the Achaeans, who still held on; and as some honest hard-working woman\n    weighs wool in her balance and sees that the scales be true [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">alêthês</term>], for she would gain some pitiful earnings for\n    her little ones, even so was the fight balanced evenly between them till the\n    time came when Zeus gave the greater glory to Hektor son of Priam, who was\n    first to spring towards the wall of the Achaeans. As he did so, he cried aloud\n    to the Trojans, \"Up, Trojans, break the wall of the Argives, and fling fire\n    upon their ships.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"442\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he hound them on, and in one body they\n    rushed straight at the wall as he had bidden them, and scaled the battlements\n    with sharp spears in their hands. Hektor laid hold of a stone that lay just\n    outside the gates and was thick at one end but pointed at the other; two of the\n    best men in a district [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>], as men now are,\n    could hardly raise it from the ground and put it on to a wagon, but Hektor\n    lifted it quite easily by himself, for the son of scheming Kronos made it light\n    for him. As a shepherd picks up a ram's fleece with one hand and finds it no\n    burden, so easily did Hektor lift the great stone and drive it right at the\n    doors that closed the gates so strong and so firmly set.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>These doors were double and high, and were kept\n    closed by two cross-bars to which there was but one key. When he had got close\n    up to them, Hektor strode towards them that his blow might gain in force and\n    struck them in the middle, leaning his whole weight against them. He broke both\n    hinges, and the stone fell inside by reason of its great weight. The portals\n    re-echoed with the sound, the bars held no longer, and the doors flew open, one\n    one way, and the other the other, through the force of the blow. Then brave\n    Hektor leaped inside with a face as dark as that of fleeing night. The gleaming\n    bronze flashed fiercely about his body and he had tow spears in his hand. None\n    but a god could have withstood him as he flung himself into the gateway, and\n    his eyes glared like fire. Then he turned round towards the Trojans and called\n    on them to scale the wall, and they did as he bade them - some of them at once\n    climbing over the wall, while others passed through the gates. The Danaans then\n    fled panic-stricken towards their ships, and all was uproar and confusion.\n    <milestone n=\"471\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
