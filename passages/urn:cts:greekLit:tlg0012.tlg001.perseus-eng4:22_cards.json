But stern fate bade Hektor stay where he\n    was before <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> and the Scaean gates.\n    Then Phoebus Apollo spoke to the son of Peleus saying, \"Why, son of Peleus, do\n    you, who are but man, give chase to me who am immortal?

King Priam was first to note him as he scoured the plain, all\n    radiant as the star which men call Orion's Hound, and whose</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"30\" unit=\"line\"/>beams blaze forth in time of harvest more\n    brilliantly than those of any other that shines by night; brightest of them all\n    though he be, he yet sends an ill sign [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] for\n    mortals, for he brings fire and fever in his train - even so did Achilles'\n    armor gleam on his breast as he sped onwards. Priam raised a cry and beat his\n    head with his hands as he lifted them up and shouted out to his dear son,\n    imploring him to return; but Hektor still stayed before the gates, for his\n    heart was set upon doing battle with Achilles. The old man reached out his arms\n    towards him and bade him for pity's sake come within the walls. \"Hektor,\" he\n    cried, \"my son, stay not to face this man alone and unsupported, or you will\n    meet death at the hands of the son of Peleus, for he is mightier than you.\n    Monster that he is; would indeed that the gods loved him no better than I do,\n    for so, dogs and vultures would soon devour him as he lay stretched on earth,\n    and a load of grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] would be lifted from my\n    heart, for many a brave son has he reft from me, either by killing them or\n    selling them away in the islands that are beyond the sea: even now I miss two\n    sons from among the Trojans who have thronged within the city, Lykaon and\n    Polydoros, whom Laothoe peeress among women bore me. Should they be still alive\n    and in the hands of the Achaeans, we will ransom them with gold and bronze, of\n    which we have store, for the old man Altes endowed his daughter richly; but if\n    they are already dead and in the house of Hades, sorrow will it be to us two\n    who were their parents; albeit the grief of others will be more short-lived\n    unless you too perish at the hands of Achilles. Come, then, my son, within the\n    city, to be the guardian of Trojan men and Trojan women, or you will both lose\n    your own life and afford a mighty triumph to the son of Peleus. Have pity also\n    on your unhappy father while life yet remains to him - on me, whom the son of\n    Kronos will destroy by a terrible doom on the threshold of old age, after I\n    have seen my sons slain and my daughters haled away as captives, my bridal\n    chambers pillaged,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"64\" unit=\"line\"/>little children dashed to earth amid the rage of\n    battle, and my sons' wives dragged away by the cruel hands of the Achaeans; in\n    the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has\n    beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear-hounds that I myself reared\n    and fed at my own table to guard my gates, but who will yet lap my blood and\n    then lie all distraught at my doors. When a young man falls by the sword in\n    battle, he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly; let what will be\n    seen, all is honorable in death, but when an old man is slain there is nothing\n    in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his gray hair and\n    beard and all that men hide for shame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>].\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"77\" unit=\"line\"/>The old man tore his gray hair as he spoke, but\n    he moved not the heart of Hektor.

Should the wretch kill you, neither I nor\n    your richly dowered wife shall ever weep, dear offshoot of myself, over the bed\n    on which you lie, for dogs will devour you at the ships of the Achaeans.\" Thus\n    did the two with many tears implore their son, but they moved not the heart of\n    Hektor, and he stood his ground awaiting huge Achilles as he drew nearer\n    towards him. As serpent in its den upon the mountains, full fed with deadly\n    poisons, waits for the approach of man - he is filled with fury and his eyes\n    glare terribly as he goes writhing round his den - even so Hektor leaned his\n    shield against a tower that jutted out from the wall and stood where he was,\n    undaunted. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"99\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Alas,\" said he to himself in the heaviness of\n    his heart, \"if I go within the gates, Polydamas will be the first to heap\n    reproach upon me, for it was he that urged me to lead the Trojans back to the\n    city on that awful night when Achilles again came forth against us. I would not\n    listen, but it would have been indeed better if I had done so. Now that my\n    folly has destroyed the host, I dare not look Trojan men and Trojan women in\n    the face, lest a worse man should say, ‘Hektor has ruined us by his\n    self-confidence.’ Surely it would be better for me to return after having\n    fought Achilles and slain him, or to die gloriously here before the city. What,\n    again, if were to lay down my shield and helmet, lean my spear against the wall\n    and go straight up to noble Achilles? What if I were to promise to give up\n    Helen, who was the fountainhead of all this war, and all the treasure that\n    Alexander brought with him in his ships to <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, aye, and to let the Achaeans divide the half of\n    everything that the city contains among themselves? I might make the Trojans,\n    by the mouths of their princes, take a solemn oath that they would hide\n    nothing, but would divide into two shares all that is within the city - but why\n    argue with myself in this way? Were I to go up to him he would show me no kind\n    of mercy; he would kill me then and there as easily as though I were a woman,\n    when I had off my armor.

Here, hard by the springs, are the goodly\n    washing-troughs of stone, where in the time of peace before the coming of the\n    Achaeans the wives and fair daughters of the Trojans used to wash their\n    clothes.

As horses in a chariot\n    race speed round the turning-posts when they are running for some great prize\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">athlon</term>] - a tripod or woman - at the games in\n    honor of some dead hero, so did these two run full speed three times round the\n    city of Priam. All the gods watched them, and the sire of gods and men was the\n    first to speak. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"168\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Alas,\" said he, \"my eyes behold a man who is\n    dear to me being pursued round the walls of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>; my heart is full of pity for Hektor, who has burned the\n    thigh-bones of many a heifer in my honor, at one while on the of many-valleyed\n    Ida, and again on the citadel of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>; and now I see noble Achilles in full pursuit of him round\n    the city of Priam.

Do as you will, but\n    we others shall not be of a mind with you.\" And Zeus answered, \"My child,\n    Trito-born, take heart.

The fawn may try to elude him\n    by crouching under cover of a bush, but he will scent her out and follow her up\n    until he gets her - even so there was no escape for Hektor from the fleet son\n    of Peleus. Whenever he made a set to get near the Dardanian gates and under the\n    walls, that his people might help him by showering down weapons from above,\n    Achilles would gain on him and head him back towards the plain, keeping himself\n    always on the city side. As a man in a dream who fails to lay hands upon\n    another whom he is pursuing - the one cannot escape nor the other overtake -\n    even so neither could Achilles come up with Hektor, nor Hektor break away from\n    Achilles; nevertheless he might even yet have escaped death had not the time\n    come when Apollo, who thus far had sustained his strength and nerved his\n    running, was now no longer to stay by him. Achilles made signs to the Achaean\n    host, and shook his head to show that no man was to aim a dart at Hektor, lest\n    another might win the glory of having hit him and he might himself come in\n    second. Then, at last, as they were nearing the fountains for the fourth time,\n    the father of all balanced his golden scales and placed a doom in each of them,\n    one for Achilles and the other for Hektor. As he held the scales by the middle,\n    the doom of Hektor fell down deep into the house of Hades - and then Phoebus\n    Apollo left him. Thereon Athena went close up to the son of Peleus and said,\n    \"Noble Achilles, favored of heaven, I think in my mind [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>] we two shall surely take back to the ships a triumph for the\n    Achaeans by slaying Hektor, for all his lust of battle.

You shall not drive spear into the\n    back of a runaway - drive it, should heaven so grant you power, drive it into\n    me as I make straight towards you; and now for your own part avoid my spear if\n    you can - would that you might receive the whole of it into your body; if you\n    were once dead the Trojans would find the war an easier matter, for it is you\n    who have harmed them most.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"289\" unit=\"line\"/>He poised his spear as he spoke and hurled it.\n    His aim was true for he hit the middle of Achilles' shield, but the spear\n    rebounded from it, and did not pierce it. Hektor was angry when he saw that the\n    weapon had sped from his hand in vain, and stood there in dismay for he had no\n    second spear. With a loud cry he called Deiphobos and asked him for one, but\n    there was no man; then he saw the truth and said to himself, \"Alas! the gods\n    have lured me on to my destruction. I deemed that the hero Deiphobos was by my\n    side, but he is within the wall, and Athena has inveigled me; death is now\n    indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it - for so Zeus and\n    his son Apollo the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been\n    ever ready to protect me.

The thick tresses of gold with which Hephaistos had crested\n    the helmet floated round it, and as the evening star that shines brighter than\n    all others through the stillness of night, even such was the gleam of the spear\n    which Achilles poised in his right hand, fraught with the death of noble\n    Hektor. He eyed his fair flesh over and over to see where he could best wound\n    it, but all was protected by the goodly armor of which Hektor had spoiled\n    Patroklos after he had slain him, save only the throat where the collar-bones\n    divide the neck from the shoulders, and this is the quickest place for the\n    life-breath [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>] to escape: here then did\n    Achilles strike him as he was coming on towards him, and the point of his spear\n    went right through the fleshy part of the neck, but it did not sever his\n    windpipe so that he could still speak. Hektor fell headlong, and Achilles\n    vaunted over him saying, \"Hektor, you deemed that you should come off\n    scatheless when you were spoiling Patroklos, and recked not of myself who was\n    not with him.

Then when\n    he had put the goodly armor on the chariot and had himself mounted, he lashed\n    his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath. The dust rose from Hektor as\n    he was being dragged along, his dark hair flew all abroad, and his head once so\n    comely was laid low on earth, for Zeus had now delivered him into the hands of\n    his foes to do him outrage in his own land. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"405\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus was the head of Hektor being dishonored in\n    the dust.

Let me\n    beseech this cruel and terrible man, if maybe he will respect the feeling of\n    his fellow-men, and have compassion on my old age. His own father is even such\n    another as myself - Peleus, who bred him and reared him to - be the bane of us\n    Trojans, and of myself more than of all others. Many a son of mine has he slain\n    in the flower of his youth, and yet, grieve for these as I may, I do so for one\n    - Hektor - more than for them all, and the bitterness of my sorrow [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] will bring me down to the house of Hades. Would\n    that he had died in my arms, for so both his ill-starred mother who bore him,\n    and myself, should have had the comfort of weeping and mourning over him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"429\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak with many tears, and all the\n    people of the city joined in his lament. Hecuba then raised the cry of wailing\n    among the Trojans. \"Alas, my son,\" she cried, \"what have I left to live for now\n    that you are no more? Night and day did I glory in. you throughout the city,\n    for you were a tower of strength to all in <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, and both men and women alike hailed you as a god. So long\n    as you lived you were their pride, but now death and destruction have fallen\n    upon you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"437\" unit=\"line\"/>Hektor's wife had as yet heard nothing, for no\n    one had come to tell her that her husband had remained without the gates. She\n    was at her loom in an inner part of the house, weaving a double purple web, and\n    embroidering it with many flowers. She told her maids to set a large tripod on\n    the fire, so as to have a warm bath ready for Hektor when he came out of\n    battle; poor woman, she knew not that he was now beyond the reach of baths, and\n    that Athena had laid him low by the hands of Achilles. She heard the cry coming\n    as from the wall, and trembled in every limb; the shuttle fell from her hands,\n    and again she spoke to her waiting-women. \"Two of you,\" she said, \"come with me\n    that I may learn what it is that has befallen; I heard the voice of my\n    husband's honored mother;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"451\" unit=\"line\"/>my own heart beats as though it would come into\n    my mouth and my limbs refuse to carry me; some great misfortune for Priam's\n    children must be at hand. May I never live to hear it, but I greatly fear that\n    Achilles has cut off the retreat of brave Hektor and has chased him on to the\n    plain where he was singlehanded; I fear he may have put an end to the reckless\n    daring which possessed my husband, who would never remain with the body of his\n    men, but would dash on far in front, foremost of them all in valor.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>Her heart beat fast, and as she spoke she flew\n    from the house like a maniac, with her waiting-women following after. When she\n    reached the battlements and the crowd of people, she stood looking out upon the\n    wall, and saw Hektor being borne away in front of the city - the horses\n    dragging him without heed or care over the ground towards the ships of the\n    Achaeans. Her eyes were then shrouded as with the darkness of night and she\n    fell fainting backwards, losing her life-breath [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhê</term>]. She tore the tiring from her head and flung it from her,\n    the frontlet and net with its plaited band, and the veil which golden Aphrodite\n    had given her on the day when Hektor took her with him from the house of\n    Eetion, after having given countless gifts of wooing for her sake. Her\n    husband's sisters and the wives of his brothers crowded round her and supported\n    her, for she was fain to die in her distraction; when she again presently\n    breathed and came to herself, she sobbed and made lament among the Trojans\n    saying, ‘Woe is me, O Hektor; woe, indeed, that to share a common lot we were\n    born, you at <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> in the house of\n    Priam, and I at <placeName key=\"perseus,Thebes\">Thebes</placeName> under the\n    wooded mountain of Plakos in the house of Eetion who brought me up when I was a\n    child - ill-starred sire of an ill-starred daughter - would that he had never\n    begotten me. You are now going into the house of Hades under the secret places\n    of the earth, and you leave me a sorrowing widow in your house. The child, of\n    whom you and I are the unhappy parents, is as yet a mere infant. Now that you\n    are gone, O Hektor, you can do nothing for him nor he for you.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"486\" unit=\"line\"/>Even though he escape the horrors of this\n    woeful war with the Achaeans, yet shall his life henceforth be one of labor\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">ponos</term>] and sorrow, for others will seize his\n    lands. The day that robs a child of his parents severs him from his own kind;\n    his head is bowed, his cheeks are wet with tears, and he will go about\n    destitute among the friends of his father, plucking one by the cloak and\n    another by the shirt. Some one or other of these may so far pity him as to hold\n    the cup for a moment towards him and let him moisten his lips, but he must not\n    drink enough to wet the roof of his mouth; then one whose parents are alive\n    will drive him from the table with blows and angry words. ‘Out with you,’ he\n    will say, ‘you have no father here,’ and the child will go crying back to his\n    widowed mother - he, Astyanax, who erewhile would sit upon his father's knees,\n    and have none but the daintiest and choicest morsels set before him. When he\n    had played till he was tired and went to sleep, he would lie in a bed, in the\n    arms of his nurse, on a soft couch, knowing neither want nor care, whereas now\n    that he has lost his father his lot will be full of hardship - he, whom the\n    Trojans name Astyanax, because you, O Hektor, were the only defense of their\n    gates and battlements. The wriggling writhing worms will now eat you at the\n    ships, far from your parents, when the dogs have glutted themselves upon you.\n    You will lie naked, although in your house you have fine and goodly raiment\n    made by hands of women. This will I now burn; it is of no use to you, for you\n    can never again wear it, and thus you will have glory [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] among the Trojans both men and women.\" In such wise did she\n    cry aloud amid her tears, and the women joined in her lament. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
