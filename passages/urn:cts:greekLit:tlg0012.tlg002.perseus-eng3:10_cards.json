However, I endured and abode, and covering my head lay down in the ship. But the ships were borne by an evil blast of wind<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"55\" unit=\"line\"/>back to the Aeolian isle; and my comrades groaned.\n    “There we went ashore and drew water, and straightway my comrades took their meal by the swift ships. But when we had tasted of food and drink, I took with me a herald and one companion<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"60\" unit=\"line\"/>and went to the glorious palace of Aeolus, and I found him feasting beside his wife and his children.

So I climbed to a rugged height, a place of outlook, and there took my stand, and I saw smoke rising from the broad-wayed earth<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>in the halls of Circe, through the thick brush and the wood. And I debated in mind and heart, whether I should go and make search, when I had seen the flaming smoke. And as I pondered, this seemed to me to be the better way, to go first to the swift ship and the shore of the sea,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>and give my comrades their meal, and send them forth to make search. But when, as I went, I was near to the curved ship, then some god took pity on me in my loneliness, and sent a great, high-horned stag into my very path. He was coming down to the river from his pasture in the wood<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>to drink, for the might of the sun oppressed him; and as he came out I struck him on the spine in the middle of the back, and the bronze spear passed right through him, and down he fell in the dust with a moan, and his spirit flew from him. Then I planted my foot upon him,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"165\" unit=\"line\"/>and drew the bronze spear forth from the wound, and left it there to lie on the ground.

Down I flung him before the ship, and heartened my comrades with gentle words, coming up to each man in turn:\n    “‘Friends, not yet shall we go down<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>to the house of Hades, despite our sorrows, before the day of fate comes upon us.

I went my way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea, and there I found my trusty comrades by the swift ship, wailing piteously, shedding big tears.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"410\" unit=\"line\"/>And as when calves in a farmstead sport about the droves of cows returning to the yard, when they have had their fill of grazing—all together they frisk before them, and the pens no longer hold them, but with constant lowing they run about their mothers—so those men, when their eyes beheld me,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>thronged about me weeping, and it seemed to their hearts as though they had got to their native land, and the very city of rugged <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, where they were bred and born. And with wailing they spoke to me winged words:\n    “‘At thy return, O thou fostered of Zeus, we are as glad<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>as though we had returned to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>, our native land. But come, tell the fate of the others, our comrades.’\n    “So they spoke, and I answered them with gentle words: ‘First of all let us draw the ship up on the land, and store our goods and all the tackling in caves.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>Then haste you, one and all, to go with me that you may see your comrades in the sacred halls of Circe, drinking and eating, for they have unfailing store.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"428"},{"n":"428","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"428\">\n    <p>\n    “So I spoke, and they quickly hearkened to my words. Eurylochus alone sought to hold back all my comrades,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/> and he spoke, and addressed them with winged words:\n    “‘Ah, wretched men, whither are we going? Why are you so enamoured of these woes, as to go down to the house of Circe, who will change us all to swine, or wolves, or lions, that so we may guard her great house perforce?<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"435\" unit=\"line\"/>Even so did the <placeName key=\"tgn,2236678\">Cyclops</placeName>, when our comrades went to his fold, and with them went this reckless Odysseus.

Nor was Eurylochus left beside the hollow ship, but he went with us, for he feared my dread reproof.\n    “Meanwhile in her halls Circe<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"450\" unit=\"line\"/>bathed the rest of my comrades with kindly care, and anointed them richly with oil, and cast about them fleecy cloaks and tunics; and we found them all feasting bountifully in the halls. But when they saw and recognized one another, face to face, they wept and wailed, and the house rang around.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the beautiful goddess drew near me, and said:\n    “‘No longer now do ye rouse this plenteous lamenting. Of myself I know both all the woes you have suffered on the teeming deep, and all the wrong that cruel men have done you on the land.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"460\" unit=\"line\"/>Nay, come, eat food and drink wine, until you once more get spirit in your breasts such as when at the first you left your native land of rugged <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>; but now ye are withered and spiritless, ever thinking of your weary wanderings, nor are your<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>hearts ever joyful, for verily ye have suffered much.’\n    “So she spoke, and our proud hearts consented. So there day after day for a full year we abode, feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when a year was gone and the seasons turned,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"470\" unit=\"line\"/>as the months waned and the long days were brought in their course, then my trusty comrades called me forth, and said:\n    “‘Strange man, bethink thee now at last of thy native land, if it is fated for thee to be saved, and to reach thy high-roofed house and thy native land.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"475"},{"n":"475","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"475\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"475\" unit=\"line\"/>“So they spoke, and my proud heart consented. So then all day long till set of sun we sat feasting on abundant flesh and sweet wine. But when the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down to sleep throughout the shadowy halls,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"480\" unit=\"line\"/>but I went up to the beautiful bed of Circe, and besought her by her knees; and the goddess heard my voice, and I spoke, and addressed her with winged words:\n    “‘Circe, fulfil for me the promise which thou gavest to send me home; for my spirit is now eager to be gone,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>and the spirit of my comrades, who make my heart to pine, as they sit about me mourning, whensoever thou haply art not at hand.’\n    “So I spoke, and the beautiful goddess straightway made answer: ‘Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, abide ye now no longer in my house against your will;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"490\" unit=\"line\"/>but you must first complete another journey, and come to the house of Hades and dread Persephone, to seek soothsaying of the spirit of Theban Teiresias, the blind seer, whose mind abides steadfast. To him even in death Persephone has granted reason,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"495\" unit=\"line\"/>that he alone should have understanding; but the others flit about as shadows.’\n    “So she spoke, and my spirit was broken within me, and I wept as I sat on the bed, nor had my heart any longer desire to live and behold the light of the sun. But when I had my fill of weeping and writhing,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"500\" unit=\"line\"/>then I made answer, and addressed her, saying:\n    “‘O Circe, who will guide us on this journey?

Thither, prince, do thou draw nigh, as I bid thee, and dig a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and around it pour a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey, thereafter with sweet wine,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"520\" unit=\"line\"/>and in the third place with water, and sprinkle thereon white barley meal.

But when with prayers thou hast made supplication to the glorious tribes of the dead, then sacrifice a ram and a black ewe, turning their heads toward Erebus but thyself turning backward, and setting thy face towards the streams of the river. Then many<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"530\" unit=\"line\"/>ghosts of men that are dead will come forth.
