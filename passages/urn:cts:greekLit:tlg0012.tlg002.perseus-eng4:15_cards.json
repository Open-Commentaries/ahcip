Ask Menelaos to send you home at once if you wish to\n    find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father and\n    brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymakhos, who has given her more\n    than any of the others, and has been greatly increasing his wedding presents. I\n    hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the house in spite of you, but\n    you know what women are - they always want to do the best they can for the man\n    who marries them, and never give another thought to the children of their first\n    husband, nor to their father either when he is dead and done with. Go home,\n    therefore, and put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant\n    that you have, until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let\n    me tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to.

I do not like to see a host either too\n    fond of his guest or too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things, and not\n    letting a man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he\n    would like to stay.

The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred and\n    has its nest, and in like manner Odysseus, after having traveled far and\n    suffered much, will return to take his revenge - if indeed he is not back\n    already and hatching mischief for the suitors.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"179\" unit=\"line\"/>\"May Zeus so grant it,\" replied Telemakhos; \"if\n    it should prove to be so, I will make vows to you as though you were a god,\n    even when I am at home.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"182\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he lashed his horses and they\n    started off at full speed through the town towards the open country.

It is not\n    very thickly peopled, but the soil is good, with much pasture fit for cattle\n    and sheep, and it abounds with wine and wheat. Dearth never comes there, nor\n    are the people [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] plagued by any sickness, but\n    when they grow old Apollo comes with Artemis and kills them with his painless\n    shafts. It contains two communities, and the whole country is divided between\n    these two. My father Ktesios son of Ormenus, a man comparable to the gods,\n    reigned over both.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Now to this place there came some cunning\n    traders from <placeName key=\"tgn,6004687\">Phoenicia</placeName> (for the\n    Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted with\n    trinkets of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in my father's\n    house, very tall and comely, and an excellent servant; these scoundrels got\n    hold of her one day when she was washing near their ship, seduced her, and\n    cajoled her in ways that no woman can resist, no matter how good she may be by\n    nature. The man who had seduced her asked her who she was and where she came\n    from, and on this she told him her father's name. ‘I come from <placeName key=\"tgn,7002861\">Sidon</placeName>,’ said she, ‘and am daughter to Arybas,\n    a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming into the town from the country\n    some Taphian pirates seized me and took me here over the sea, where they sold\n    me to the man who owns this house, and he gave them their price for me.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>\"The man who had seduced her then said, ‘Would\n    you like to come along with us to see the house of your parents and your\n    parents themselves? They are both alive and are said to be well off.’</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"434"},{"n":"434","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"434\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"434\" unit=\"line\"/>\"‘I will do so gladly,’ answered she, ‘if you\n    men will first swear me a solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the\n    way.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"437\" unit=\"line\"/>\"They all swore as she told them, and when they\n    had completed their oath the woman said, ‘Hush; and if any of your men meets me\n    in the street or at the well, do not let him speak to me, for fear some one\n    should go and tell my master, in which case he would suspect something. He\n    would put me in prison, and would have all of you murdered; keep your own\n    counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can, and send me word\n    when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold as I can lay my hands on,\n    and there is something else also that I can do towards paying my fare. I am\n    nurse to the son of the good man of the house, a funny little fellow just able\n    to run about. I will carry him off in your ship, and you will get a great deal\n    of wealth for him if you take him and sell him in foreign parts.’</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"454\" unit=\"line\"/>\"On this she went back to the house. The\n    Phoenicians stayed a whole year till they had loaded their ship with much\n    precious merchandise, and then, when they had got freight enough, they sent to\n    tell the woman. Their messenger, a very cunning fellow, came to my father's\n    house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and while\n    my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and bargaining\n    about it, he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went back to the ship,\n    whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the house. In the fore part\n    of the house she saw the tables set with the cups of guests who had been\n    feasting with my father, as being in attendance on him; these were now all gone\n    to a meeting of the population [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] assembly, so\n    she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the bosom of her dress,\n    while I followed her, for I knew no better. The sun was now set, and darkness\n    was over all the land, so we hurried on as fast as we could till we reached the\n    harbor, where the Phoenician ship was lying. When they had got on board they\n    sailed their ways over the sea, taking us with them, and Zeus sent then a fair\n    wind; six days did we sail both night and day, but on the seventh day Artemis\n    struck the woman and she fell heavily down into the ship's hold as though she\n    were a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the\n    seals and fishes, and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the winds\n    and waves took the ship to <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>,\n    where <placeName key=\"perseus,Laertes\">Laertes</placeName> gave sundry of his\n    chattels for me, and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon this\n    country.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>Odysseus answered, \"Eumaios, I have heard the\n    story of your misfortunes with the most lively interest and pity, but Zeus has\n    given you good as well as evil, for in spite of everything you have a good\n    master, who sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a\n    good life, whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to\n    city.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"493"},{"n":"493","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"493\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"493\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did they converse, and they had only a\n    very little time left for sleep, for it was soon daybreak. In the meantime\n    Telemakhos and his crew were nearing land, so they loosed the sails, took down\n    the mast, and rowed the ship into the harbor. They cast out their mooring\n    stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore, mixed\n    their wine, and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough to eat and\n    drink Telemakhos said, \"Take the ship on to the town, but leave me here, for I\n    want to look after the herdsmen on one of my farms. In the evening, when I have\n    seen all I want, I will come down to the city, and tomorrow morning in return\n    for your trouble I will give you all a good dinner with meat and wine.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"508\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Theoklymenos said, ‘And what, my dear\n    young friend, is to become of me? To whose house, among all your chief men, am\n    I to repair? Or shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"512\" unit=\"line\"/>\"At any other time,\" replied Telemakhos, \"I\n    should have bidden you go to my own house, for you would find no want of\n    hospitality; at the present moment, however, you would not be comfortable\n    there, for I shall be away, and my mother will not see you; she does not often\n    show herself even to the suitors, but sits at her loom weaving in an upper\n    chamber, out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can go to -\n    I mean Eurymakhos the son of Polybos, who is held in the highest estimation by\n    every one in <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName>. He is much the\n    best man and the most persistent wooer, of all those who are paying court to my\n    mother and trying to take Odysseus’ place. Zeus, however, in heaven alone knows\n    whether or not they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes\n    place.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"525\" unit=\"line\"/>As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his\n    right hand - a hawk, Apollo's messenger. It held a dove in its talons, and the\n    feathers, as it tore them off, fell to the ground midway between Telemakhos and\n    the ship. On this Theoklymenos called him apart and caught him by the hand.\n    \"Telemakhos,\" said he, \"that bird did not fly on your right hand without having\n    been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew it was an omen; it\n    means that you will remain powerful and that there will be no house in the\n    <term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term> of <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName> more royal than your own.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"535"},{"n":"535","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"535\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"535\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I wish it may prove so,\" answered Telemakhos.\n    \"If it does, I will show you so much good will and give you so many presents\n    that all who meet you will congratulate you.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"539\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he said to his friend Peiraios, \"Peiraios,\n    son of Klytios, you have throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me\n    of all those who have accompanied me to <placeName key=\"perseus,Pylos\">Pylos</placeName>; I wish you would take this stranger to your own house\n    and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"544\" unit=\"line\"/>And Peiraios answered, \"Telemakhos, you may\n    stay away as long as you please, but I will look after him for you, and he\n    shall find no lack of hospitality.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"547\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke he went on board, and bade the\n    others do so also and loose the hawsers, so they took their places in the ship.\n    But Telemakhos bound on his sandals, and took a long and doughty spear with a\n    head of sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the\n    hawsers, thrust the ship off from land, and made on towards the city as they\n    had been told to do, while Telemakhos strode on as fast as he could, till he\n    reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine were feeding, and\n    where dwelt the excellent swineherd, who was so devoted a servant to his\n    master. <milestone n=\"557\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
