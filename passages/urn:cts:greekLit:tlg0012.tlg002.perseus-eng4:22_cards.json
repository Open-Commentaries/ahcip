He had no thought of death - who amongst all the revelers\n    would think that one man, however brave, would stand alone among so many and\n    kill him? The arrow struck Antinoos in the throat, and the point went clean\n    through his neck, so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his hand, while\n    a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils.

Still, Amphimedon just took a piece of the\n    top skin from off Telemakhos’ wrist, and Ktesippos managed to graze Eumaios’\n    shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to the ground. Then\n    Odysseus and his men let drive into the crowd of suitors. Odysseus hit\n    Eurydamas, Telemakhos Amphimedon, and Eumaios Polybos.

Then Athena from her\n    seat on the rafter held up her deadly aegis, and the hearts of the suitors\n    quailed.

Now, however, tell me which of the women in the\n    house have misconducted themselves, and who are innocent.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"419\" unit=\"line\"/>\"I will tell you the truth [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">alêtheia</term>], my son,\" answered Eurykleia. \"There are\n    fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things, such as carding wool, and\n    all kinds of household work. Of these, twelve in all have misbehaved, and have\n    been wanting in respect to me, and also to Penelope. They showed no disrespect\n    to Telemakhos, for he has only lately grown and his mother never permitted him\n    to give orders to the female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your\n    wife all that has happened, for some god has been sending her to sleep.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Do not wake her yet,\" answered Odysseus, \"but\n    tell the women who have misconducted themselves to come to me.\"</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"431"},{"n":"431","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"431\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"431\" unit=\"line\"/>Eurykleia left the room to tell the women, and\n    make them come to Odysseus; in the meantime he called Telemakhos, the stockman,\n    and the swineherd. \"Begin,\" said he, \"to remove the dead, and make the women\n    help you. Then, get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables and seats.\n    When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters, take the women into the\n    space between the domed room and the wall of the outer court, and run them\n    through with your swords till they are quite dead, and have forgotten all about\n    love and the way in which they used to lie in secret with the suitors.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"446\" unit=\"line\"/>On this the women came down in a body, weeping\n    and wailing bitterly. First they carried the dead bodies out, and propped them\n    up against one another in the gatehouse. Odysseus ordered them about and made\n    them do their work quickly, so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had\n    done this, they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and water, while\n    Telemakhos and the two others shoveled up the blood and dirt from the ground,\n    and the women carried it all away and put it out of doors. Then when they had\n    made the whole place quite clean and orderly, they took the women out and\n    hemmed them in the narrow space between the wall of the domed room and that of\n    the yard, so that they could not get away: and Telemakhos said to the other\n    two, \"I shall not let these women die a clean death, for they were insolent to\n    me and my mother, and used to sleep with the suitors.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"465\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying he made a ship's cable fast to one of\n    the bearing-posts that supported the roof of the domed room, and secured it all\n    around the building, at a good height, lest any of the women's feet should\n    touch the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been set\n    for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest, and a terrible\n    fate awaits them, even so did the women have to put their heads in nooses one\n    after the other and die most miserably. Their feet moved convulsively for a\n    while, but not for very long.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"474\" unit=\"line\"/>As for Melanthios, they took him through the\n    room into the inner court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew\n    out his vitals and gave them to the dogs raw, and then in their fury they cut\n    off his hands and his feet.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"478"},{"n":"478","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"478\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"478\" unit=\"line\"/>When they had done this they washed their hands\n    and feet and went back into the house, for all was now over; and Odysseus said\n    to the dear old nurse Eurykleia, \"Bring me sulfur, which cleanses all\n    pollution, and fetch fire also that I may burn it, and purify the cloisters.\n    Go, moreover, and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants, and also all\n    the maid servants that are in the house.\"</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"485\" unit=\"line\"/>\"All that you have said is true,\" answered\n    Eurykleia, \"but let me bring you some clean clothes - a shirt and cloak.
