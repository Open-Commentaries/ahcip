The wording here at O.19.107–114 shows the only place in the <em>Odyssey</em> where Penelope is said to have <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ herself, O.19.108, but even here the glory emanates more broadly from the poetic tradition that features primarily Odysseus and only secondarily those who are close to him, especially Penelope. This passage here will be relevant to the context of the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ attributed to Odysseus at O.24.196, to be analyzed in the comment on that line (further analysis in H24H 9§§22–23; also BA 38). Here at O.19.107–114, the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of Penelope depends on the validity of comparing this glory with the corresponding glory of the unnamed king whose ‘good acts of <em>dikē</em>’ energize the fertility and prosperity of the land he rules. Since the words about this just king are spoken by the disguised Odysseus, it is evident that he himself will take the role of that just king when the time comes. But when exactly will that time come? Will it be after he kills the suitors? Or will it be after he dies? I ask the second question because the wording that refers to the inhabitants of the fertile and prosperous land of the just king is remarkably parallel to the wording that referred to the inhabitants of the kingdom of Odysseus after he is dead: they are said to be <em>olbioi</em> ‘blessed’, O.11.137. See the comment at O.11.136–137. This wording comes from the prophecy of Teiresias to Odysseus at O.11.090-137, which I quoted in my comments on Rhapsody 11. As also in those comments, I draw attention once again to the word <em>olbioi</em> here, which I continue to translate here as ‘blessed’, and which describes the inhabitants of the kingdom of Odysseus. As I argued in the comment at O.11.136–137, this word <em>olbioi</em>, ‘blessed’, refers to the blessings of fertility and prosperity that the inhabitants of Ithaca receive as a result of the hero’s death (the prophecy of his death at O.11.136–137 will be retold at O.23.283–284). This death will lead to the transformation of Odysseus into a cult hero (further analysis in H24H 11§59). In the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>, verse 172, this same word <em>olbioi</em>, ‘blessed’, is used to describe cult heroes who are immortalized after death and who enjoy a state of bliss in the Islands of the Blessed, which is a paradisiacal setting that transcends the temporal and the spatial constraints associated with sites where the bodies of cult heroes are believed to be buried (further analysis in H24H 11§15). My argument, then, is that the picture of a just king who rules over a fertile and prosperous land here at O.19.107–114 refers to the future status of Odysseus as a cult hero. But I still need to confront a possible objection: why would a cult hero be described as a <em>basileus</em>, ‘king’, at O.19.109? And besides, would not the title of ‘king’ fit Odysseus when he is alive, right after he kills the suitors and recovers his kingdom—and before he is dead? True, the title would fit then as well, but I maintain that the context of the words spoken by the disguised Odysseus to Penelope is more transcendent. The fact is, the title of ‘king’ fits the cult hero as well. There is evidence to show that the generic cult hero is conventionally described as a <em>basileus</em>, ‘king’ (further analysis in BA 170–172). In a stylized <em>thrēnos</em> or ‘lament’ composed by Pindar (F 133, quoted by Plato <em>Meno</em> 81b), for example, <em>hēroes hagnoi</em>, ‘holy heroes’, are equated with <em>basilēes</em>, ‘kings’ (βασιλῆες ἀγαυοὶ … ἥροες ἁγνοί. Also, in an inscription grounded in rituals honoring the dead, in a context of promising a blissful life after death, the dead person is told: καὶ τότ’ ἔπειτ’ ἄ[λλοισι μεθ’] ἡρώεσσιν ἀνάξει[ς] ‘and then you will be king [<em>anassein</em>] among the other heroes [<em>hērōes</em>]’ (<em>IG</em> XIV 638 = SEG 40:824[2]; further analysis in BA 171, where the citation needs to be corrected).  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:19.107-19.114","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"olbios 'blessed'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"kleos 'glory'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"basileus 'king'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eudikiai ‘good acts of justice [dikē]’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.239504","title":"Odyssey 19.135","body":"<p>In the comment at O.17.381–394, I noted the listing there of four kinds of craftsment who belong to the category of <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>) ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’, where <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ is to be understood as a legally-sanctioned zone of activity within which craftsmen are authorized to be practicing their crafts.

In the anthropogonic myths that have survived in the Greek language—as also in other Indo-European languages—two most common alternative versions claim that the First Human originated from a tree or from a rock.

And even deceptive things that look like real things can still be equal to real things, the same as real things. As I indicated in my comments at O.16.172–212, for example, Odysseus is really ‘equal to the immortals’ when he looks like an immortal in ritual contexts. As I also indicated in those comments, the contexts of <em>eïskein</em> ‘make likenesses, liken’ at O.16.187 and O.16.200 show that Telemachus was justified in saying that Odysseus looks the same as a god after being touched by the wand of Athena. If Telemachus was at first deceived by the looks of Odysseus in such contexts, then the deception was happening from the viewpoint of an uninitiated beholder who could not yet distinguish between what is deceptive and what is real. Similarly in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em>, the figure of Hesiod has been such an uninitiated beholder before his poetic initiation into the art of the Muses. After his initiation, however, he can now envision what is real even when he beholds things that can be deceptive. The same principle holds whenever Odysseus utters words to be envisioned only by those who have already been initiated into the art of the Muses of poetry. That is what happens here at O.19.203. What is deceptive about the deceptive things that Odysseus is saying in his Third Cretan Tale is not the fact that some things ‘look like’ other things. Rather, what is deceptive is that <em>pseudea</em> ‘deceptive things’ look like <em>etuma</em> ‘real things’. And, once again, even these deceptive things that look like real things can still be equal to real things—the same as the real things that are seen by those who are initiated into the art of the Muses. This art is the art of poetic imagination, which can make even deceptive things look like real things, be equal to real things, be the same as real things. Such is the art that is borrowed by the alluring figure of Helen when she makes her voice identical to the voice of any wife of any Homeric hero: see the comment on <em>eïksein</em> ‘liken’ at O.04.279. Helen’s voice, borrowed from the poetry of the Muses, has the power of conjuring the voices of the wives themselves. And, by extension, her poetic voice has the power of conjuring the very images of the wives. True, Helen means to deceive, but her deceptive words in this narrative frame are the same as the real words of Homeric poetry in the overall narrative frame of that poetry—real words that activate visions of the real things of Homeric poetry. These real things are whatever is real for this poetry, which is figured as true overall, even if it contains things that seem at first to be deceptive. For Homeric poetry, whatever is divinely true can contain deceptions and still be true.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:19.203","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"eïskein ‘make likenesses, liken’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"pseude- 'deceptive'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"homoio- 'same as, looking like'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.240241","title":"Odyssey 19.204-19.212","body":"<p>The emotional response of Penelope to the Third Cretan Tale as told by the disguised Odysseus is to break down in tears.

The verb <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> is used at O.19.535 in the imperative, and the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>, is in the accusative; likewise at O.19.555, <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> takes the accusative of the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>. This verb is derived from <em>krinein</em>/<em>krinesthai</em>, the basic meaning of which is ‘separate, distinguish, judge’. The verb <em>krinein</em>, in the active voice, can be translated as ‘interpret’ when combined with the noun <em>opsis</em>, ‘vision’, as its object (Herodotus 7.19.1-2) or with <em>enupnion</em>, ‘dream’, as its object (Herodotus 1.120.1). It is a question of interpreting-in-performance. In the middle voice, <em>hupo-krinestha</em>i suggests that the performer is interpreting for himself as well as for others. The basic idea of <em>hupo-krinesthai</em>, then, is to see the real meaning of what others see and to quote back, as it were, what this vision is really telling them. Such a vision distinguishes what is real from what is unreal.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:19.535","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hupokrinesthai 'respond to (a sign), interpret'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.242280","title":"Odyssey 19.547","body":"<p>In Penelope’s dream as she reports it here at O.19.547, the talking eagle that dream-interprets itself to be really Odysseus says that this dream is not just any <em>onar</em> or ‘dream’ but rather, more than that, it is a <em>hupar esthlon </em>or ‘waking reality’ (οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλ&#x27; ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν). The reality that is being foretold in the dream here at O.19.547 is signaled by the word <em>hupar</em>, which refers to a dream that is seen when one is asleep but will also be seen after one is awake, as opposed to the word <em>onar</em> (also <em>oneiros</em>), which refers to a dream seen only in sleep. (The word <em>hupar</em> is cognate with the element <em>suppar</em>- of the Hittite verb <em>suppariya</em>- ‘sleep’: see DELG under ὕπαρ.) The reality foretold by a dream that is <em>hupar</em> is reinforced here at O.19.547 by the epithet <em>esthlon</em> ‘real, genuine, good’, which is derived from the root <em>es</em>- ‘to be’ as in <em>esti</em> ‘is’. The vision signaled by the <em>hupar esthlon</em> or ‘waking reality’, as I have translated it, will come to fulfillment, that is, <em>it will reach its real outcome</em>, as expressed by the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’. Imperfective uses of this verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ refer to realities that are still in the making, that have not yet come to fulfillment: see for example the comment at I.02.330. Perfective uses of this same word, on the other hand, refer to a reality that has come to fulfillment. Here at O.19.547, we see a future perfect use: the talking eagle of the dream is foretelling a reality that will have already happened when the right moment in the narrative finally arrives. This verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’, as used here at O.19.547, focuses on a central idea in contexts of composition-in-performance. The idea is this: whatever is being said in the performance will come to fulfillment in the composition when all is said and done.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:19.547","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"esthlo- 'real, genuine, good'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"onar 'dream'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hupar esthlon 'wakeful reality'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hupar 'dream that turns into reality'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"teleîn ‘reach an outcome; bring to fulfillment’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.242351","title":"Odyssey 19.562-569","body":"<p>In the response of Penelope, O.19.562–569, to the response of Odysseus in interpreting her dream, she says that there are two kinds of dreams, passing through two kinds of <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’, O.19.562: the first kind passes through a gate of <em>keras</em> ‘horn’, and the second kind, through a gate of <em>elephas</em> ‘ivory’, O.19.563. The first kind signals what is real, while the second, what is deceptive. That is why the mental power of distinguishing what is real from what is unreal becomes so seriously important. But there is also a playful side to these images of horn and ivory, as reflected in the word play that links (1) the noun <em>keras</em> ‘horn’ with the verb <em>krainein</em> in the sense of ‘authorize as real’, O.19.567, and (2) the noun <em>elephas</em> ‘ivory’ with the verb <em>elephairesthai</em> in the sense of ‘deceive’, O.19.565. The object of the verb <em>krainein</em> ‘authorize as real’ here is <em>etuma</em> ‘real things’ (ἔτυμα), O.19.567: that is what dreams from a Gate of Horn will bring. Correspondingly, the object of what is brought by dreams from a Gate of ivory is <em>a-kráan-ta</em> ‘unauthorized’ (ἀκράαντα), O.19.565. The playfulness extends further: I suspect that the symbolism of <em>keras</em> ‘horn’ here involves not only the elevated sense of ‘authorization’ but also the earthy sense of sexual desire. I suspect that the Aphrodisiac properties linked with horn as a substance are in play here. Perhaps relevant is all the folkore surrounding the earthy English adjective ‘horny’. When I speak of ‘horn’ here, I have in mind primarily the <em>kerata</em> ‘antlers’ of deer, the aphrodisiac properties of which are highlighted for example by the physician Galen (vol. 14 p. 240 ed. C. G. Kühn 1827). I ask myself: why does Penelope cry and cry in her dream about losing her geese? Perhaps her familiarity with the geese can be linked with her familiarity—however unwelcome—with the suitors. The geese have been around for twenty years, and where was the eagle during all this time? Perhaps that is why it is safe for Penelope to offer a recusal at O.19.568–569: surely my dream came from a Gate of Ivory, not from a Gate of Horn. For more on Penelope’s dream, I strongly recommend the analysis of Levaniouk 2011:229–246, with a critical survey of the multifarious interpretations that have been offered over the years by experts and nonexperts alike.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002:19.562-19.569","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Gates of Horn and Ivory"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.242399","title":"Odyssey 19.562","body":"<p>The adjective <em>amenēna</em> ‘having no mental power [<em>menos</em>] inside’ applies elsewhere exclusively to the dead.
