He no longer turned so much as\n    a glance towards <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>, for he did not\n    think that any of the immortals would go and help either Trojans or Danaans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"10\" unit=\"line\"/>But King Poseidon had kept no blind look-out; he\n    had been looking admiringly on the battle from his seat on the topmost crests\n    of wooded <placeName key=\"tgn,1008943\">Samothrace</placeName>, whence he could\n    see all Ida, with the city of Priam and the ships of the Achaeans.

Three strides he took, and with\n    the fourth he reached his goal - <placeName key=\"tgn,5004273\">Aigai</placeName>, where is his glittering golden palace, imperishable, in the\n    depths of the sea.

As he went his way over the\n    waves the sea-monsters left their lairs, for they knew their lord, and came\n    gamboling round him from every quarter of the deep, while the sea in her\n    gladness opened a path before his chariot. So lightly did the horses fly that\n    the bronze axle of the car was not even wet beneath it; and thus his bounding\n    steeds took him to the ships of the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"32\" unit=\"line\"/>Now there is a certain huge cavern in the depths\n    of the sea midway between <placeName key=\"perseus,Tenedos\">Tenedos</placeName>\n    and rocky Imbros; here Poseidon lord of the earthquake stayed his horses,\n    unyoked them, and set before them their ambrosial forage. He hobbled their feet\n    with hobbles of gold which none could either unloose or break, so that they\n    might stay there in that place until their lord should return. This done he\n    went his way to the host of the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"39\" unit=\"line\"/>Now the Trojans followed Hektor son of Priam in\n    close array like a storm-cloud or flame of fire, fighting with might and main\n    and raising the cry battle; for they deemed that they should take the ships of\n    the Achaeans and kill all their chiefest heroes then and there. Meanwhile\n    earth-encircling Poseidon lord of the earthquake cheered on the Argives, for he\n    had come up out of the sea and had assumed the form and voice of Kalkhas. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"46\" unit=\"line\"/>First he spoke to the two Ajaxes, who were doing\n    their best already, and said, \"Ajaxes, you two can be the saving of the\n    Achaeans if you will put out all your strength and not let yourselves be\n    daunted. I am not afraid that the Trojans, who have got over the wall in force,\n    will be victorious in any other part, for the Achaeans can hold all of them in\n    check, but I much fear that some evil will befall us here where furious Hektor,\n    who boasts himself the son of great Zeus himself, is leading them on like a\n    pillar of flame. May some god, then, put it into your hearts to make a firm\n    stand here, and to incite others to do the like. In this case you will drive\n    him from the ships even though he be inspired by Zeus himself.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"59\" unit=\"line\"/>As he spoke the earth-encircling lord of the\n    earthquake struck both of them with his scepter and filled their hearts with\n    daring. He made their legs light and active, as also their hands and their\n    feet. Then, as the soaring falcon poises on the wing high above some sheer\n    rock, and presently swoops down to chase some bird over the plain, even so did\n    Poseidon lord of the earthquake wing his flight into the air and leave them. Of\n    the two, swift Ajax son of Oileus was the first to know who it was that had\n    been speaking with them, and said to Ajax son of Telamon, \"Ajax, this is one of\n    the gods that dwell on Olympus, who in the likeness of the seer is bidding us\n    fight hard by our ships. It was not Kalkhas the seer and diviner of omens; I\n    knew him at once by his feet and knees as he turned away, for the gods are soon\n    recognized.

Meanwhile the earth-encircler\n    roused the Achaeans, who were resting in the rear by the ships overcome at once\n    by hard fighting and by grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] at seeing\n    that the Trojans had got over the wall in force. Tears began falling from their\n    eyes as they beheld them, for they made sure that they should not escape\n    destruction; but the lord of the earthquake passed lightly about among them and\n    urged their battalions to the front. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"91\" unit=\"line\"/>First he went up to Teucer and Leitos, the hero\n    Peneleos, and Thoas and Deipyros; Meriones also and Antilokhos, valiant\n    warriors; all did he exhort. \"Shame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>] on you\n    young Argives,\" he cried, \"it was on your prowess I relied for the saving of\n    our ships;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"97\" unit=\"line\"/>if you fight not with might and main, this very\n    day will see us overcome by the Trojans. Of a truth my eyes behold a great and\n    terrible portent which I had never thought to see - the Trojans at our ships -\n    they, who were heretofore like panic-stricken hinds, the prey of jackals and\n    wolves in a forest, with no strength but in flight for they cannot defend\n    themselves. Hitherto the Trojans dared not for one moment face the attack of\n    the Achaeans, but now they have sallied far from their city and are fighting at\n    our very ships through the cowardice of our leader and the disaffection of the\n    people themselves, who in their discontent care not to fight in defense of the\n    ships but are being slaughtered near them. True, King Agamemnon son of Atreus\n    is responsible [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aitios</term>] for our disaster by having\n    insulted the son of Peleus, still this is no reason why we should leave off\n    fighting. Let us be quick to heal, for the hearts of the brave heal quickly.\n    You do ill to be thus remiss, you, who are the finest warriors in our whole\n    army. I blame no man for keeping out of battle if he is a weakling, but I am\n    indignant with such men as you are. My good friends, matters will soon become\n    even worse through this slackness; think, each one of you, of his own respect\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">aidôs</term>] and sense of <term xml:lang=\"grc\">nemesis</term>, for the hazard of the fight is extreme. Great Hektor is now\n    fighting at our ships; he has broken through the gates and the strong bolt that\n    held them.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did the earth-encircler address the\n    Achaeans and urge them on. Thereon round the two Ajaxes there gathered strong\n    bands of men, of whom not even Ares nor Athena, marshaler of hosts could make\n    light if they went among them, for they were the picked [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">krinô</term>] men of all those who were now awaiting the onset of Hektor\n    and the Trojans. They made a living fence, spear to spear, shield to shield,\n    buckler to buckler, helmet to helmet, and man to man. The horse-hair crests on\n    their gleaming helmets touched one another as they nodded forward, so closely\n    locked in battle were they; the spears they brandished in their strong hands\n    were interlaced, and their hearts were set on battle. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"136\" unit=\"line\"/>The Trojans advanced in a dense body, with\n    Hektor at their head pressing right on as a rock that comes thundering down the\n    side of some mountain from whose brow the winter torrents have torn it; the\n    foundations of the dull thing have been loosened by floods of rain, and as it\n    bounds headlong on its way it sets the whole forest in an uproar; it swerves\n    neither to right nor left till it reaches level ground, but then for all its\n    fury it can go no further - even so easily did Hektor for a while seem as\n    though he would career through the tents and ships of the Achaeans till he had\n    reached the sea in his murderous course; but the closely serried battalions\n    stayed him when he reached them, for the sons of the Achaeans thrust at him\n    with swords and spears pointed at both ends, and drove him from them so that he\n    staggered and gave ground; thereon he shouted to the Trojans, \"Trojans,\n    Lycians, and Dardanians, fighters in close combat, stand firm: the Achaeans\n    have set themselves as a wall against me, but they will not check me for long;\n    they will give ground before me if the mightiest of the gods, the thundering\n    spouse of Hera, has indeed inspired my onset.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he put heart and soul into\n    them all. Deiphobos son of Priam went about among them intent on deeds of\n    daring with his round shield before him, under cover of which he strode quickly\n    forward. Meriones took aim at him with a spear, nor did he fail to hit the\n    broad orb of ox-hide; but he was far from piercing it for the spear broke in\n    two pieces long ere he could do so; moreover Deiphobos had seen it coming and\n    had held his shield well away from him. Meriones drew back under cover of his\n    comrades, angry alike at having failed to vanquish Deiphobos, and having broken\n    his spear. He turned therefore towards the ships and tents to fetch a spear\n    which he had left behind in his tent. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"169\" unit=\"line\"/>The others continued fighting, and the cry of\n    battle rose up into the heavens. Teucer son of Telamon was the first to kill\n    his man, to wit, the warrior Imbrios son of Mentor rich in horses. Until the\n    Achaeans came he had lived in Pedaeum, and had married Medesikaste a bastard\n    daughter of Priam; but on the arrival of the Danaan fleet he had gone back to\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName>, and was a great man among\n    the Trojans, dwelling near Priam himself, who gave him like honor with his own\n    sons. The son of Telamon now struck him under the ear with a spear which he\n    then drew back again, and Imbrios fell headlong as an ash-tree when it is\n    felled on the crest of some high mountain beacon, and its delicate green\n    foliage comes toppling down to the ground. Thus did he fall with his\n    bronze-equipped armor ringing harshly round him, and Teucer sprang forward with\n    intent to strip him of his armor; but as he was doing so, Hektor took aim at\n    him with a spear. Teucer saw the spear coming and swerved aside, whereon it hit\n    Amphimakhos, son of Kteatos son of Aktor, in the chest as he was coming into\n    battle, and his armor rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.\n    Hektor sprang forward to take Amphimakhos' helmet from off his temples, and in\n    a moment Ajax threw a spear at him, but did not wound him, for he was encased\n    all over in his terrible armor; nevertheless the spear struck the boss of his\n    shield with such force as to drive him back from the two corpses, which the\n    Achaeans then drew off. Stichios and Menestheus, leaders of the Athenians, bore\n    away Amphimakhos to the host of the Achaeans, while the two brave and impetuous\n    Ajaxes did the like by Imbrios. As two lions snatch a goat from the hounds that\n    have it in their fangs, and bear it through thick brushwood high above the\n    ground in their jaws, thus did the Ajaxes bear aloft the body of Imbrios, and\n    strip it of its armor. Then the son of Oileus severed the head from the neck in\n    revenge for the death of Amphimakhos, and sent it whirling over the crowd as\n    though it had been a ball, till fell in the dust at Hektor's feet. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"206"},{"n":"206","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"206\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"206\" unit=\"line\"/>Poseidon was exceedingly angry that his\n    grandson Amphimakhos should have fallen; he therefore went to the tents and\n    ships of the Achaeans to urge the Danaans still further, and to devise evil for\n    the Trojans. Idomeneus met him, as he was taking leave of a comrade, who had\n    just come to him from the fight, wounded in the knee. His fellow-warriors bore\n    him off the field, and Idomeneus having given orders to the physicians went on\n    to his tent, for he was still thirsting for battle.

He fell gasping\n    from his chariot and Antilokhos great Nestor's son, drove his horses from the\n    Trojans to the Achaeans. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"402\" unit=\"line\"/>Deiphobos then came close up to Idomeneus to\n    avenge Asios, and took aim at him with a spear, but Idomeneus was on the\n    look-out and avoided it, for he was covered by the round shield he always bore\n    - a shield of oxhide and bronze with two arm-rods on the inside. He crouched\n    under cover of this, and the spear flew over him, but the shield rang out as\n    the spear grazed it, and the weapon sped not in vain from the strong hand of\n    Deiphobos, for it struck Hypsenor son of Hippasus, shepherd of his people, in\n    the liver under the midriff, and his limbs failed beneath him. Deiphobos\n    vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Of a truth Asios has not\n    fallen unavenged; he will be glad even while passing into the house of Hades,\n    strong warden of the gate, that I have sent some one to escort him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"417\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he vaunt, and the Argives were stung\n    with grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>] over what he said. Noble\n    Antilokhos was more angry than any one, but grief did not make him forget his\n    friend and comrade. He ran up to him, bestrode him, and covered him with his\n    shield; then two of his staunch comrades, Mekisteus son of Echios, and Alastor\n    stooped down, and bore him away groaning heavily to the ships. But Idomeneus\n    ceased not his fury. He kept on striving continually either to enshroud some\n    Trojan in the darkness of death, or himself to fall while warding off the evil\n    day from the Achaeans. Then fell Alkathoos son of noble Aisyetes: he was\n    son-in-law to Anchises, having married his eldest daughter Hippodameia who was\n    the darling of her father and mother, and excelled all her generation in\n    beauty, accomplishments, and understanding, wherefore the bravest man in all\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> had taken her to wife - him\n    did Poseidon lay low by the hand of Idomeneus, blinding his bright eyes and\n    binding his strong limbs in fetters so that he could neither go back nor to one\n    side, but stood stock still like pillar or lofty tree when Idomeneus struck him\n    with a spear in the middle of his chest.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"439\" unit=\"line\"/>The coat of mail that had hitherto protected\n    his body was now broken, and rang harshly as the spear tore through it. He fell\n    heavily to the ground, and the spear stuck in his heart, which still beat, and\n    made the butt-end of the spear quiver till dread Ares put an end to his life.\n    Idomeneus vaunted over him and cried with a loud voice saying, \"Deiphobos,\n    since you are in a mood to vaunt, shall we cry quits now that we have killed\n    three men to your one? Nay, sir, stand in fight with me yourself, that you may\n    learn what manner of Zeus-begotten man am I that have come hither. Zeus first\n    begot Minos chief ruler in <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName>, and\n    Minos in his turn begot a son, noble Deukalion; Deukalion begot me to be a\n    ruler over many men in <placeName key=\"tgn,7012056\">Crete</placeName>, and my\n    ships have now brought me hither, to be the bane of yourself, your father, and\n    the Trojans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did he speak, and Deiphobos was in two\n    minds, whether to go back and fetch some other Trojan to help him, or to take\n    up the challenge single-handed. In the end, he deemed it best to go and fetch\n    Aeneas, whom he found standing in the rear, for he had long been aggrieved with\n    Priam because in spite his brave deeds he did not give him his due share of\n    honor. Deiphobos went up to him and said, \"Aeneas, prince among the Trojans, if\n    you know any ties of kinship, help me now to defend the body of your sister's\n    husband; come with me to the rescue of Alkathoos, who being husband to your\n    sister brought you up when you were a child in his house, and now Idomeneus has\n    slain him.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"468\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he moved the heart of Aeneas,\n    and he went in pursuit of Idomeneus, big with great deeds of valor; but\n    Idomeneus was not to be thus daunted as though he were a mere child; he held\n    his ground as a wild boar at bay upon the mountains, who abides the coming of a\n    great crowd of men in some lonely place - the bristles stand upright on his\n    back, his eyes flash fire, and he whets his tusks in his eagerness to defend\n    himself against hounds and men -</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"476\" unit=\"line\"/>even so did famed Idomeneus hold his ground and\n    budge not at the coming of Aeneas. He cried aloud to his comrades looking\n    towards Askalaphos, Aphareus, Deipyros, Meriones, and Antilokhos, all of them\n    brave warriors- \"Hither my friends,\" he cried, \"and leave me not single-handed\n    - I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a\n    redoubtable dispenser of death battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth\n    when a man's strength is greatest; if I was of the same age as he is and in my\n    present mind, either he or I should soon bear away the prize of victory </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"487"},{"n":"487","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"487\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"487\" unit=\"line\"/>On this, all of them as one man stood near him,\n    shield on shoulder. Aeneas on the other side called to his comrades, looking\n    towards Deiphobos, <placeName key=\"tgn,7008038\">Paris</placeName>, and Agenor,\n    who were leaders of the Trojans along with himself, and the people followed\n    them as sheep follow the ram when they go down to drink after they have been\n    feeding, and the heart of the shepherd is glad - even so was the heart of\n    Aeneas gladdened when he saw his people follow him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"496\" unit=\"line\"/>Then they fought furiously in close combat\n    about the body of Alkathoos, wielding their long spears; and the bronze armor\n    about their bodies rang fearfully as they took aim at one another in the press\n    of the fight, while the two heroes Aeneas and Idomeneus, peers of Ares, outdid\n    every one in their desire to hack at each other with sword and spear. Aeneas\n    took aim first, but Idomeneus was on the lookout and avoided the spear, so that\n    it sped from Aeneas' strong hand in vain, and fell quivering in the ground.\n    Idomeneus meanwhile smote Oinomaos in the middle of his belly, and broke the\n    plate of his corselet, whereon his bowels came gushing out and he clutched the\n    earth in the palms of his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. Idomeneus\n    drew his spear out of the body, but could not strip him of the rest of his\n    armor for the rain of darts that were showered upon him: moreover his strength\n    was now beginning to fail him so that he could no longer charge,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"513\" unit=\"line\"/>and could neither spring forward to recover his\n    own weapon nor swerve aside to avoid one that was aimed at him; therefore,\n    though he still defended himself in hand-to-hand fight, his heavy feet could\n    not bear him swiftly out of the battle. Deiphobos aimed a spear at him as he\n    was retreating slowly from the field, for his bitterness against him was as\n    fierce as ever, but again he missed him, and hit Askalaphos, the son of Ares;\n    the spear went through his shoulder, and he clutched the earth in the palms of\n    his hands as he fell sprawling in the dust. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"521\" unit=\"line\"/>Grim Ares of awful voice did not yet know that\n    his son had fallen, for he was sitting on the summits of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName> under the golden clouds, by command of\n    Zeus, where the other gods were also sitting, forbidden to take part in the\n    battle. Meanwhile men fought furiously about the body. Deiphobos tore the\n    helmet from off his head, but Meriones sprang upon him, and struck him on the\n    arm with a spear so that the visored helmet fell from his hand and came ringing\n    down upon the ground. Thereon Meriones sprang upon him like a vulture, drew the\n    spear from his shoulder, and fell back under cover of his men. Then Polites,\n    brother of Deiphobos, passed his arms around his waist, and bore him away from\n    the battle till he got to his horses that were standing in the rear of the\n    fight with the chariot and their driver. These took him towards the city\n    groaning and in great pain, with the blood flowing from his arm. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"540\" unit=\"line\"/>The others still fought on, and the battle-cry\n    rose to heaven without ceasing. Aeneas sprang on Aphareus son of Kaletor, and\n    struck him with a spear in his throat which was turned towards him; his head\n    fell on one side, his helmet and shield came down along with him, and death,\n    life's foe, was shed around him. Antilokhos spied his chance, flew forward\n    towards Thoon, and wounded him as he was turning round. He laid open the vein\n    that runs all the way up the back to the neck; he cut this vein clean away\n    throughout its whole course, and Thoon fell in the dust face upwards,\n    stretching out his hands imploringly towards his comrades.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"550\" unit=\"line\"/>Antilokhos sprang upon him and stripped the\n    armor from his shoulders, glaring round him fearfully as he did so. The Trojans\n    came about him on every side and struck his broad and gleaming shield, but\n    could not wound his body, for Poseidon stood guard over the son of Nestor,\n    though the darts fell thickly round him. He was never clear of the foe, but was\n    always in the thick of the fight; his spear was never idle; he poised and aimed\n    it in every direction, so eager was he to hit some one from a distance or to\n    fight him hand to hand. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"560\" unit=\"line\"/>As he was thus aiming among the crowd, he was\n    seen by Adamas son of Asios, who rushed towards him and struck him with a spear\n    in the middle of his shield, but Poseidon made its point without effect, for he\n    grudged him the life of Antilokhos. One half, therefore, of the spear stuck\n    fast like a charred stake in Antilokhos' shield, while the other lay on the\n    ground. Adamas then sought shelter under cover of his men, but Meriones\n    followed after and hit him with a spear midway between the private parts and\n    the navel, where a wound is particularly painful to wretched mortals. There did\n    Meriones transfix him, and he writhed convulsively about the spear as some bull\n    whom mountain herdsmen have bound with ropes of withies and are taking away\n    perforce. Even so did he move convulsively for a while, but not for very long,\n    till Meriones came up and drew the spear out of his body, and his eyes were\n    veiled in darkness. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"576\" unit=\"line\"/>Helenos then struck Deipyros with a great\n    Thracian sword, hitting him on the temple in close combat and tearing the\n    helmet from his head; the helmet fell to the ground, and one of those who were\n    fighting on the Achaean side took charge of it as it rolled at his feet, but\n    the eyes of Deipyros were closed in the darkness of death. </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"581"},{"n":"581","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"581\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"581\" unit=\"line\"/>On this Menelaos was stung by grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">akhos</term>], and made menacingly towards Helenos,\n    brandishing his spear; but Helenos drew his bow, and the two attacked one\n    another at one and the same moment, the one with his spear, and the other with\n    his bow and arrow.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"586\" unit=\"line\"/>The son of Priam hit the breastplate of\n    Menelaos' corselet, but the arrow glanced from off it.

When the two were hard by one\n    another the spear of the son of Atreus turned aside and he missed his aim;\n    Peisandros then struck the shield of brave Menelaos but could not pierce it,\n    for the shield stayed the spear and broke the shaft; nevertheless he was glad\n    and made sure of victory; forthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword\n    and sprang upon him. Peisandros then seized the bronze battle-axe, with its\n    long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield,\n    and the two made at one another. Peisandros struck the peak of Menelaos'\n    crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaos hit Peisandros as he\n    was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his nose; the\n    bones cracked and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust. He\n    fell backwards to the ground, and Menelaos set his heel upon him, stripped him\n    of his armor, and vaunted over him saying, \"Even thus shall you Trojans leave\n    the ships of the Achaeans, proud and insatiate of battle though you be: nor\n    shall you lack any of the disgrace and shame which you have heaped upon myself.\n    Cowardly she-wolves that you are, you feared not the anger [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">mênis</term>] of dread Zeus, avenger of violated\n    hospitality,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"625\" unit=\"line\"/>who will one day destroy your city; you stole\n    my wedded wife and wickedly carried off much treasure when you were her guest,\n    and now you would fling fire upon our ships, and kill our heroes.

All things pall after a\n    while - sleep, love, sweet song, and stately dance - still these are things of\n    which a man would surely have his fill rather than of battle, whereas it is of\n    battle that the Trojans are insatiate.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"640\" unit=\"line\"/>So saying Menelaos stripped the blood-stained\n    armor from the body of Peisandros, and handed it over to his men; then he again\n    ranged himself among those who were in the front of the fight. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"643\" unit=\"line\"/>Harpalion son of King Pylaimenes then sprang\n    upon him; he had come to fight at <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> along with his father, but he did not go home again. He\n    struck the middle of Menelaos' shield with his spear but could not pierce it,\n    and to save his life drew back under cover of his men, looking round him on\n    every side lest he should be wounded. But Meriones aimed a bronze-tipped arrow\n    at him as he was leaving the field, and hit him on the right buttock; the arrow\n    pierced the bone through and through, and penetrated the bladder, so he sat\n    down where he was and breathed his last in the arms of his comrades, stretched\n    like a worm upon the ground and watering the earth with the blood that flowed\n    from his wound. The brave Paphlagonians tended him with all due care; they\n    raised him into his chariot, and bore him sadly off to the city of <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName>; his father went also with him weeping\n    bitterly, but there was no ransom that could bring his dead son to life again. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"660\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7008038\">Paris</placeName> was deeply grieved by the death\n    of Harpalion, who was his host when he went among the Paphlagonians; he aimed\n    an arrow, therefore, in order to avenge him.

But Hektor had not yet heard, and did not know that the Argives were\n    making havoc of his men on the left wing of the battle, where the Achaeans ere\n    long would have triumphed over them, so vigorously did Poseidon cheer them on\n    and help them. He therefore held on at the point where he had first forced his\n    way through the gates and the wall, after breaking through the serried ranks of\n    Danaan warriors. It was here that the ships of Ajax and Protesilaos were drawn\n    up by the sea-shore; here the wall was at its lowest, and the fight both of man\n    and horse raged most fiercely. The Boeotians and the Ionians with their long\n    tunics, the Locrians, the men of Phthia, and the famous force of the Epeans\n    could hardly stay Hektor as he rushed on towards the ships, nor could they\n    drive him from them, for he was as a wall of fire. The chosen men of the\n    Athenians were in the van, led by Menestheus son of Peteos, with whom were also\n    Pheidas, Stichios, and stalwart Bias: Meges son of Phyleus, Amphion, and\n    Drakios commanded the Epeans, while Medon and staunch Podarkes led the men of\n    Phthia. Of these, Medon was bastard son to Oileus and brother of Ajax, but he\n    lived in Phylake away from his own country, for he had killed the brother of\n    his stepmother Eriopis, the wife of Oileus; the other, Podarkes, was the son of\n    Iphiklos son of Phylakos.

We Achaeans are excellent warriors, but the\n    scourge of Zeus has fallen heavily upon us. Your heart, indeed, is set on\n    destroying our ships,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"813\" unit=\"line\"/>but we too have bands that can keep you at bay,\n    and your own fair town shall be sooner taken and sacked by ourselves. The time\n    is near when you shall pray Zeus and all the gods in your flight, that your\n    steeds may be swifter than hawks as they raise the dust on the plain and bear\n    you back to your city.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"821"},{"n":"821","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"821\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"821\" unit=\"line\"/>As he was thus speaking a bird flew by upon his\n    right hand, and the host of the Achaeans shouted, for they took heart at the\n    omen. But Hektor answered, \"Ajax, braggart and false of tongue, would that I\n    were as sure of being son for evermore to aegis-bearing Zeus, with Queen Hera\n    for my mother, and of being held in like honor with Athena and Apollo, as I am\n    that this day is big with the destruction of the Achaeans; and you shall fall\n    among them if you dare abide my spear; it shall rend your fair body and bid you\n    glut our hounds and birds of prey with your fat and your flesh, as you fall by\n    the ships of the Achaeans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"833\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words he led the way and the others\n    followed after with a cry that rent the air, while the host shouted behind\n    them. The Argives on their part raised a shout likewise, nor did they forget\n    their prowess, but stood firm against the onslaught of the Trojan chieftains,\n    and the cry from both the hosts rose up to heaven and to the brightness of\n    Zeus' presence. <milestone n=\"837\" unit=\"line\"/>\n    </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
