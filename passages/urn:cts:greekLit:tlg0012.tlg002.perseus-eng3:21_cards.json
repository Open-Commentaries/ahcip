My dear mother, for all that she is wise, declares that she will follow another lord, forsaking this house;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"105\" unit=\"line\"/>yet I laugh, and am glad with a witless mind.

And amazement seized all who saw him, that he set them out so orderly, though before he had never seen them. Then he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"125\" unit=\"line\"/>Thrice he made it quiver in his eagerness to draw it, and thrice he relaxed his effort, though in his heart he hoped to string the bow and shoot an arrow through the iron. And now at the last he would haply have strung it in his might, as for the fourth time he sought to draw up the string, but Odysseus nodded in dissent, and checked him in his eagerness.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"130\" unit=\"line\"/>Then the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them again:\n    “Out on it, even in days to come shall I be a coward and a weakling, or else I am too young, and have not yet trust in my might to defend me against a man, when one waxes wroth without a cause. But, come now, you that are mightier than I,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"135\" unit=\"line\"/>make trial of the bow, and let us end the contest.”\n    So saying, he set the bow from him on the ground, leaning it against the jointed, polished door, and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down again on the seat from which he had risen.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"140\" unit=\"line\"/>Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke among them: “Rise up in order, all you of our company, from left to right, beginning from the place where the cupbearer pours the wine.”\n    So spoke Antinous, and his word was pleasing to them. Then first arose Leiodes, son of Oenops,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"145\" unit=\"line\"/>who was their soothsayer, and ever sat by the fair mixing-bowl in the innermost part of the hall; deeds of wanton folly were hateful to him alone, and he was full of indignation at all the wooers. He it was who now first took the bow and swift arrow, and he went and stood upon the threshold, and began to try the bow;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"150\" unit=\"line\"/>but he could not string it. Ere that might be his hands grew weary, as he sought to draw up the string, his unworn delicate hands; and he spoke among the wooers:\n    “Friends, it is not I that shall string it; let another take it. For many princes shall this bow rob of spirit and of life, since verily it is better far<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"155\" unit=\"line\"/>to die than to live on and fail of that for the sake of which we ever gather here, waiting expectantly day after day. Now many a man even hopes in his heart and desires to wed Penelope, the wife of Odysseus; but when he shall have made trial of the bow, and seen the outcome, thereafter let him woo<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"160\" unit=\"line\"/>some other of the fair-robed Achaean women with his gifts, and seek to win her; then should Penelope wed him who offers most, and who comes as her fated lord.”</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"163"},{"n":"163","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"163\">\n    <p>\n    So he spoke, and set the bow from him, leaning it against the jointed, polished door,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"165\" unit=\"line\"/>and hard by he leaned the swift arrow against the fair bow-tip, and then sat down on the seat from which he had risen. But Antinous rebuked him, and spoke, and addressed him: “Leiodes, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, a dread word and grievous! I am angered to hear it,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"170\" unit=\"line\"/>if forsooth this bow is to rob princes of spirit and of life, because thou art not able to string it. For, I tell thee, thy honored mother did not bear thee of such strength as to draw a bow and shoot arrows; but others of the lordly wooers will soon string it.”\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>So he spoke, and called to Melanthius, the goatherd: “Come now, light a fire in the hall, Melanthius; and set by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and bring forth a great cake of the fat that is within, that we youths may warm the bow, and anoint it with fat,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"180\" unit=\"line\"/>and so make trial of it, and end the contest.”\n    So he spoke, and Melanthius straightway rekindled the unwearied fire, and brought and placed by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and he brought forth a great cake of the fat that was within. Therewith the youths warmed the bow, and made trial of it, but they could not<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"185\" unit=\"line\"/>string it, for they were far lacking in strength.\n    Now Antinous was still persisting and godlike Eurymachus, leaders of the wooers, who were far the best in valiance; but those other two had gone forth both together from the hall, the neatherd and the swineherd of divine Odysseus;<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"190\" unit=\"line\"/>and after them Odysseus himself went forth from the house. But when they were now outside the gates and the court, he spoke and addressed them with gentle words: \n    “Neatherd, and thou too swineherd, shall I tell you something or keep it to myself? Nay, my spirit bids me tell it.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"195\" unit=\"line\"/>What manner of men would you be to defend Odysseus, if he should come from somewhere thus suddenly, and some god should bring him? Would you bear aid to the wooers or to Odysseus? Speak out as your heart and spirit bid you.”\n    Then the herdsmen of the cattle answered him:<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>“Father Zeus, oh that thou wouldest fulfil this wish! Grant that that man may come back, and that some god may guide him. Then shouldest thou know what manner of might is mine, and how my hands obey.”\n    And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus; might come back to his own home.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"205"},{"n":"205","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" subtype=\"card\" n=\"205\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"205\" unit=\"line\"/>But when he knew with certainty the mind of these, he made answer, and spoke to them again, saying:\n    “At home now in truth am I here before you, my very self. After many grievous toils I am come in the twentieth year to my native land. And I know that by you two<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"210\" unit=\"line\"/>alone of all my thralls is my coming desired, but of the rest have I heard not one praying that I might come back again to my home. But to you two will I tell the truth, even as it shall be. If a god shall subdue the lordly wooers unto me, I will bring you each a wife, and will give you possessions<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"215\" unit=\"line\"/>and a house built near my own, and thereafter you two shall be in my eyes friends and brothers of Telemachus. Nay, come, more than this, I will shew you also a manifest sign, that you may know me well and be assured in heart, even the scar of the wound which long ago a boar dealt me with his white tusk,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"220\" unit=\"line\"/>when I went to <placeName key=\"tgn,7011022\">Parnassus</placeName> with the sons of Autolycus.” \n    So saying, he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And when the two had seen it, and had marked each thing well, they flung their arms about wise Odysseus, and wept; and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"225\" unit=\"line\"/>And even in like manner Odysseus kissed their heads and hands. And now the light of the sun would have gone down upon their weeping, had not Odysseus himself checked them, and said:\n    “Cease now from weeping and wailing, lest some one come forth from the hall and see us, and make it known within as well.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"230\" unit=\"line\"/>But go within one after another, not all together, I first and you thereafter, and let this be made a sign. All the rest, as many as are lordly wooers, will not suffer the bow and the quiver to be given to me; but do thou, goodly Eumaeus, as thou bearest the bow through the halls,<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"235\" unit=\"line\"/>place it in my hands, and bid the women bar the close-fitting doors of their hall.

And the two slaves of divine Odysseus went in as well.\n    <milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"245\" unit=\"line\"/>Eurymachus was now handling the bow, warming it on this side and on that in the light of the fire; but not even so was he able to string it; and in his noble heart he groaned, and with a burst of anger he spoke and addressed them: \n    “Out on it! Verily I am grieved for myself and for you all.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"250\" unit=\"line\"/>It is in no wise for the marriage that I mourn so greatly, grieved though I am; for there are many other Achaean women, some in sea-girt <placeName key=\"tgn,1007519\">Ithaca</placeName> itself, and some in other cities; but I mourn if in truth we fall so far short of godlike Odysseus in might, seeing that we cannot string<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"255\" unit=\"line\"/>his bow.

Soon by thy swine, alone and apart from men, shall the swift hounds devour thee—hounds thyself didst rear—if but Apollo<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"365\" unit=\"line\"/>be gracious to us, and the other immortal gods.”\n    So they spoke, and he set down the bow, as he bore it, in that very place, seized with fear because many men were crying out aloud in the halls. But Telemachus on the other side called out threateningly:\n    “Father, bear the bow onward—soon shalt thou rue giving heed to all—<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"370\" unit=\"line\"/>lest, younger though I am, I drive thee to the field, and pelt thee with stones; for in strength I am the better. I would that I were even so much better in strength and might than all the wooers that are in the house; then would I soon send many a one<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"375\" unit=\"line\"/>forth from our house to go his way in evil case; for they devise wickedness.”\n    So he spoke, but all the wooers laughed merrily at him, and relaxed the bitterness of their anger against Telemachus. Howbeit the swineherd bore the bow through the hall, and came up to wise Odysseus, and put it in his hands.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"380\" unit=\"line\"/>Then he called forth the nurse Eurycleia, and said to her:\n    “Telemachus bids thee, wise Eurycleia, to bar the close-fitting doors of the hall, and if any of the women hear within groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"385\" unit=\"line\"/>rush out, but remain where they are in silence at their work.”\n    So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; and she barred the doors of the stately halls. \n    But in silence Philoetius hastened forth from the house, and barred the gates of the well-fenced court.<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"390\" unit=\"line\"/>Now there lay beneath the portico the cable of a curved ship, made of byblus plant, wherewith he made fast the gates, and then himself went within.

Then glad at heart was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"415\" unit=\"line\"/>that the son of crooked-counselling Cronos sent him an omen, and he took up a swift arrow, which lay by him on the table, bare, but the others were stored within the hollow quiver, even those of which the Achaeans were soon to taste. This he took, and laid upon the bridge of the bow, and drew the bow-string and the notched arrow<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"420\" unit=\"line\"/>even from the chair where he sat, and let fly the shaft with sure aim, and did not miss the end of the handle of one of the axes, but clean through and out at the end passed the arrow weighted with bronze. But he spoke to Telemachus, saying:\n    “Telemachus, the stranger<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"425\" unit=\"line\"/>that sits in thy halls brings no shame upon thee, nor in any wise did I miss the mark, or labour long in stringing the bow; still is my strength unbroken—not as the wooers scornfully taunt me. But now it is time that supper too be made ready for the Achaeans, while yet there is light, and thereafter must yet other sport be made<milestone ed=\"p\" n=\"430\" unit=\"line\"/>with song and with the lyre; for these things are the accompaniments of a feast.”\n    He spoke, and made a sign with his brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, girt about him his sharp sword, and took his spear in his grasp, and stood by the chair at his father's side, armed with gleaming bronze.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
