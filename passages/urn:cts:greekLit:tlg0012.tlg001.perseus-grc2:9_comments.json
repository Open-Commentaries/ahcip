By implication, this island became Aeolian precisely because it was captured by the principal hero of the Aeolians. The vastness of this story is even broader in scope, since we can see in the <em>Iliad</em> occasional references to other such conquests accomplished by Achilles. Most prominent are the Iliadic references to his capturing of two cities located on the Aeolian mainland of Asia Minor: they are Lyrnessos and Thēbē. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and his capturing of Briseis are mentioned for the first time at I.02.690–691. What then follows at I.02.691 is a mention of his conquering the walled city of Thēbē as well. Thēbē is mentioned already at I.01.366: it was there that Achilles captured another woman, Chryseis, when he conquered that city, I.01.366–369. For background on Briseis and on Chryseis, I again strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography. Another native of Thēbē was Andromache, who had been married off to Hector at Troy before the beginning of the Trojan War: she was taken captive only later, after Troy was captured, and she was then allotted as a war-prize to the son of Achilles, Neoptolemos: the story was told in an epic that was part of the epic Cycle and was known as the <em>Iliou Persis</em> ‘Destruction of Ilion’, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, plot summary by Proclus p. 108 line 9 (ed. Allen 1912). That said, I now elaborate further on the argument initiated in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694: the conquests of these territories by Achilles, especially his capture of Lesbos, can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologizes a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” of east Aeolis, as it were, by west Aeolian migrants from Thessaly, situated in the European mainland, which was the reputed birthplace of Achilles. See Nagy 2011b:171–173. In using the term “east Aeolis” here, I am referring to the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos, together with the facing mainland of northern Asia Minor. The “colonization” of this area has conventionally been described as the “Aeolian Migration,” and the term ‘migration’ here matches neatly the appropriate Greek word, <em>apoikiā</em> as used in Strabo 9.2.3 C401 and elsewhere (see Nagy 2011b:161). The reference at I.09.129 to the captive women from Lesbos can be correlated with the poetic traditions of Lesbos as later attested in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus, both dated around 600 BCE. These poetic traditions, which are decidedly Aeolian, derive not only from the island of Lesbos but also from the island of Tenedos and from the mainland of northern Asia Minor facing these two islands. See HPC 184–185. Traces of these Aeolian poetic traditions can be seen in the Iliadic references to such figures as Briseis, Chryseis, Andromache, and the seven unnamed captive women from Lesbos. All these figures derive from Aeolian poetic traditions, and the same can be said about the figure of Achilles himself: in terms of his poetic heritage, he is Achilles the Aeolian. See Nagy 2011b:171–172. But there is an important difference to be highlighted here: Achilles is an Aeolian from European Thessaly, while the captive women are Aeolians from Asia Minor and from the offshore islands of Lesbos and Tenedos (on the captive woman Hekamede from Tenedos, see the anchor comment at I.11.624–627). In the Ionian poetic traditions of epic as exemplified by Homeric poetry, we can track the early influence of corresponding Aeolian poetic traditions as exemplified at a later period, around 600 BCE, by the songmaking of Sappho and Alcaeus.

Then, in the rest of the verse at I.09.001 and continuing into I.09.002–003 there is a transition into the narrative as it now resumes. A fitting term for this sort of transition is <em>rhapsodic sequencing</em>. Here as elsewhere, the transition of the narrative from one rhapsody to the next shows that each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Iliad</em>—and each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Odyssey</em>—is a distinct unit of performance. In the classical period of Athens, as we see in Plato’s <em>Ion</em>, professional performers of Homeric rhapsodies were known as <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’. The term <em>rhapsōidiā</em>, translated in this comment as ‘rhapsody’, originates from the traditions of <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’ who performed poetry in competitive relay with other rhapsodes. Accordingly, the <em>rhapsōidiai</em> ‘rhapsodies’ of Homeric poetry can be seen as units of relay performance. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.1-9.3","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"rhapsodic sequencing"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.077615","title":"Iliad 9.002","body":"<p>The name <em>Phúza</em>, which is a personification of <em>phúza</em> ‘running away out of fear’ is described here at I.09.02 as the <em>hetaírē</em> ‘companion’ of <em>Phóbos</em>, which is a personification of <em>phóbos</em> ‘turning and running out of fear’.

The verse-final feminine form <em>hetaírē</em>, a morphologically leveled replacement of the older feminine form <em>hétairă</em>, likewise meaning ‘companion’, occurs only here in the <em>Iliad</em>.

In all three of these other occurrences as well, <em>hetaírē</em> is verse-final. The application of <em>hetaírē</em> to <em>Phúza</em> here at I.09.02 is comparable to the application of the vocalically rhyming form <em>krataiḗ</em> to <em>Moîra</em>, personification of <em>moîra</em> in the sense of ‘fate, destiny’.

You could be, Nestor tells Diomedes, the youngest of my sons. Elsewhere, at O.03.412–415, six of Nestor’s sons are mentioned, including Peisistratos, who figures prominently in the <em>Odyssey</em>, and Thrasymedes, who has a major role in the fighting at Troy in the <em>Iliad</em>. Missing from this list in the <em>Odyssey</em>, because he had been killed in action at Troy, is Antilokhos. There is a passing reference to the death of Antilokhos at O.04.186–188. When Nestor makes his remark at I.09.057–058 about the youngest of his sons, the referent here must be Antilokhos, since that hero’s relatively young age is noted elsewhere as well in the <em>Iliad</em>. For example, in a battle scene where the Achaeans are urging each other to fight hard, Menelaos singles out Antilokhos as he urges him on, telling him there is no Achaean there who is younger. And the relatively young age of Diomedes is likewise noted in the <em>Iliad</em>. In another battle scene, at I.14.109–114, while addressing his fellow warriors, Diomedes boasts that ‘I am the youngest among you’ (νεώτατός εἰμι μεθ’ ὑμῖν), I.14.112. So, it may be that Diomedes is even younger than Antilokhos, but that is not the point. Rather, the point is that Antilokhos and Diomedes are comparably young. Nestor himself highlights the youth of Antilokhos when he addresses him on a later occasion, I.23.306. In view of all these other Homeric references, Nestor’s remark at I.09.057–058 about Diomedes as comparable in age to Antilokhos can be seen as an evocation of an epic moment that is awaiting Nestor in the future. At that future moment, Antilokhos, his own young son, will try to save the old hero when Nestor gets entangled in his chariot and is about to be attacked and killed by the chariot fighter Memnon. Antilokhos will succeed in saving Nestor, but it is the young son and not the old father who will now get killed by Memnon. This epic moment, which is in the future for the <em>Iliad</em>, is evidently narrated in a part of the epic Cycle, the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, as we read in the plot-summary of Proclus p. 106 lines 4–6 (ed. Allen 1912). On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas. There is also a reference to this same epic moment in a song of Pindar, <em>Pythian</em> 6.28–42. These non–Iliadic passages have already been cited in the anchor comment on the relevant Iliadic passage, Ι.08.076–117. In that passage, which is already in the epic past from the standpoint of the current Iliadic passage taken from I.09.057–058, Diomedes was acting as a stand-in for Antilokhos, performing in the epic past a task that mirrors the task that will be undertaken by Antilokhos in the epic future. That task was to save Nestor from his entanglement in his chariot. Diomedes saved the life of Nestor, and Nestor knows it when he now compares young Diomedes to his own young son, I.09.057–058. As for Antilokhos, he too will save the life of Nestor, but, unlike Diomedes, he will lose his own life in performing this same task in the future, which is, to save Nestor from another entanglement. And of course Nestor does not yet know it. So, there is an irony in the remark made by the old hero here in comparing young Diomedes to young Antilokhos, though of course the character of Nestor did not intend such an irony.

The story about these women as it is told here is then retold at I.09.270–272. The significance of the Aeolian identification of these women will be analyzed in the anchor comment that follows. The focus in the present comment, by contrast, is on the moral problems that are raised in the story about the actual capture of these women—and of other women in the Iliad who suffer the same fate of captivity. Two prominent examples are Briseis and Chryseis, captured by Achilles when he conquered the cities of Lyrnessos and Thēbē respectively, as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694. All these women—the seven unnamed ones and the two named ones—evidently became the common property of the Achaeans after being captured by Achilles, and it appears that Agamemnon as the Achaean over-king originally had a say, ostensibly by way of public deliberation with the rest of the Achaeans, in deciding which woman was allotted as a war-prize to which Achaean man. Even though all these women were captured by Achilles alone, they were thereafter to be distributed as war-prizes among the Achaean men as a group. In terms of this reconstruction of the story as outlined here, the role of Agamemnon in having a say about the awarding of these captive women as war-prizes is morally problematic. Likewise problematic is this over-king’s role in the original awarding of the captive woman Briseis, with the approval of the Achaeans, as a war-prize to Achilles—and in the parallel awarding of the captive woman Chryseis to himself. Moreover, the seizing of Briseis by Agamemnon after his loss of Chryseis is even more problematic. Here, then, is the overriding question to be asked about the treatment of all these women as war-prizes: is Agamemnon entitled to have a say in deciding which Achaean man will have sex with which woman? And the question can be broadened: are the Achaeans as a group entitled to make such decisions? Such a broader question extends also to Achilles.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.128-9.131","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles the Aeolian"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"seven captive Aeolian women from Lesbos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"epic deeds of Achilles before the time dramatized in the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.079499","title":"Iliad 9.128–131/ anchor comment on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 2","body":"<p>The story that is being told here at I.09.128–131 and retold at I.09.270–272 centers on one single stunning event: Achilles captured the entire island of Lesbos. By implication, this island became Aeolian precisely because it was captured by the principal hero of the Aeolians. The vastness of this story is even broader in scope, since we can see in the <em>Iliad</em> occasional references to other such conquests accomplished by Achilles. Most prominent are the Iliadic references to his capturing of two cities located on the Aeolian mainland of Asia Minor: they are Lyrnessos and Thēbē. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and his capturing of Briseis are mentioned for the first time at I.02.690–691. What then follows at I.02.691 is a mention of his conquering the walled city of Thēbē as well. Thēbē is mentioned already at I.01.366: it was there that Achilles captured another woman, Chryseis, when he conquered that city, I.01.366–369. (For background on Briseis and on Chryseis, I again strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography.) Another native of Thēbē was Andromache, who had been married off to Hector at Troy before the beginning of the Trojan War: she was taken captive only later, after Troy was captured, and she was then allotted as a war-prize to the son of Achilles, Neoptolemos: the story was told in an epic that was part of the epic Cycle and was known as the <em>Iliou Persis</em> ‘Destruction of Ilion’, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, plot summary by Proclus p. 108 line 9 (ed. Allen 1912). That said, I now elaborate further on the argument initiated in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694: the conquests of these territories by Achilles, especially his capture of Lesbos, can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologizes a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” of east Aeolis, as it were, by west Aeolian migrants from Thessaly, situated in the European mainland, which was the reputed birthplace of Achilles. (See Nagy 2011b:171–173.) In using the term “east Aeolis” here, I am referring to the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos, together with the facing mainland of northern Asia Minor. The “colonization” of this area has conventionally been described as the “Aeolian Migration,” and the term ‘migration’ here matches neatly the appropriate Greek word, <em>apoikiā</em> as used in Strabo 9.2.3 C401 and elsewhere (see Nagy 2011b:161). The reference at I.09.129 to the captive women from Lesbos can be correlated with the poetic traditions of Lesbos as later attested in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus, both dated around 600 BCE. These poetic traditions, which are decidedly Aeolian, derive not only from the island of Lesbos but also from the island of Tenedos and from the mainland of northern Asia Minor facing these two islands. (See HPC 184–185.) Traces of these Aeolian poetic traditions can be seen in the Iliadic references to such figures as Briseis, Chryseis, Andromache, and the seven unnamed captive women from Lesbos. All these figures derive from Aeolian poetic traditions, and the same can be said about the figure of Achilles himself: in terms of his poetic heritage, he is Achilles the Aeolian. (See Nagy 2011b:171–172.) But there is an important difference to be highlighted here: Achilles is an Aeolian from European Thessaly, while the captive women are Aeolians from Asia Minor and from the offshore islands of Lesbos and Tenedos (on the captive woman Hekamede from Tenedos, see the anchor comment at I.11.624–627). In the Ionian poetic traditions of epic as exemplified by Homeric poetry, we can track the early influence of corresponding Aeolian poetic traditions as exemplified at a later period, around 600 BCE, by the songmaking of Sappho and Alcaeus.

The scholia D for the <em>Iliad</em> give details, with specific reference to I.09.130: this beauty contest was a seasonally recurring event that took place in a federal space that was shared by five cities on the island of Lesbos, and this space was sacred to the goddess Hērā. See Nagy 2015§§135–159. There are occasional references to this space in what remains of the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus (again, Nagy 2015). Also, as we see at I.09.128, the beauty of the women of Lesbos is matched by the beauty of their handiwork, which externalizes their aristocratic charisma. Such handiwork, as we will see in another comment, comes to life in the skillfulness displayed by women in practicing their art of pattern-weaving: a prime example is Andromache the Aeolian, described at Ι.22.440–441 in the act of pattern-weaving. There and elsewhere, the craft of pattern-weaving by Aeolian women is linked with the power of the craft of Homeric poetry to make contact with the Bronze Age.

The intervening plurals as at 186 are negligible, since plurals can normally substitute for duals in Homeric diction. But duals cannot substitute for plurals. So, the problem is, who are the referents in these contexts where the dual form is used? One way to approach the problem is to follow through on the formulation of Nestor, who had said that Phoenix must lead the embassy, I.09.168, followed by Ajax and then by Odysseus, I.09.169. See the comment on I.09.167–170. But then, when the group reaches the shelter of Achilles, it is said explicitly that Odysseus now takes the lead, I.09.192. Further, when Ajax signals to Phoenix at I.09.223, it is Odysseus who picks up the signal instead, as indicated by the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ (see further the comment on I.09.223), and now it will be Odysseus and not Phoenix who delivers the first of the three speeches. At I.09.224, Odysseus fills a goblet with wine and toasts Achilles—a gesture that may have seemed more appropriate for Achilles to perform as the host, not for Odysseus as the guest. For Odysseus to violate the etiquette is not to violate the traditions of myth, however, in t<em>hat it is traditional for the figure of Odysseus to violate rules of etiquette</em>. At O.08.475–476, to cite another example, Odysseus seems to be behaving like a host in a situation where he is really the guest. (For more on this point, see HQ 142.) In any case, right after pouring the wine and toasting Achilles, Odysseus starts at I.09.225 to deliver the first of the three speeches addressed by the three ambassadors to Achilles. Only after this speech of Odysseus, I.09.225–306, and after the reply of Achilles to that speech, I.09.308–429, will Phoenix get a chance to give his own speech, I.09.434–605—even though Nestor had intended for Phoenix to be the first speaker. So, returning to I.09.192, where Odysseus already takes the lead away from Phoenix, we can view this point in the narrative as the marker of a transition: before this point, the dual forms could refer to Ajax and Odysseus, as led by Phoenix, but then, after this point, the dual forms could refer to Phoenix and Ajax, as led by Odysseus. Alternatively the dual forms in these verses could have an elliptic function, where a singular X is paired with a group Y. This way, the dual still refers to a pair, even though the second part of the pair is a group.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.182-9.198","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"plural vs. dual"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"problematic duals of Rhapsody 9"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"dual vs. plural"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ellipsis"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.080312","title":"Iliad 09.185–191","body":"<p>As the three ambassadors and the two heralds enter the shelter of Achilles, they find the hero singing <em>klea andrōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men’ while his companion Patroklos is listening to the song, waiting to continue it where Achilles will leave off. We see here a dramatization of relay singing, which is a model for the poetic world of <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’ who perform Homeric poetry in sequence. But the relay from one performance to the next is a sequencing that does not have to happen only at one particular time. The sequencing can be seen as happening over time. Relevant here is the meaning of the name of Patroklos, <em>Patrokléēs</em> ‘he who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’. Here the etymology of the name is adjusted by way of interpreting the component <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ in the plural sense of the word, not only in the singular sense that was noted in the comment on I.01.345. In terms of this meaning, the <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ of song is passed on, from one generation to the next, as the living heritage of the <em>patéres</em> ‘ancestors’. As for the original singing of Achilles himself in his shelter, it mirrors the singing of the god Apollo, who performs his songs while accompanying himself on the lyre. In the case of the lyre played by Achilles as he sings, it had once belonged to Eëtion, father of Andromache. As we have seen in the anchor comment at I.06.407–439, Andromache in the <em>Iliad</em> sings laments in expressing her sorrows. Such singing is relevant to songs sung about and perhaps also by Achilles himself. In the case of songs sung about Achilles, we know for a fact that these songs touched on that hero’s direct involvement in the sorrowful fate of Andromache herself. On that involvement, see the comment on I.17.194–214.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.185-9.191","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"lament"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"rhapsodic sequencing"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"speaking name\" (nomen loquens)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Patroklos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"klea andrōn ‘the glories [klea] of men’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"sorrows of Andromache"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.080358","title":"Iliad 9.186-9.190","body":"<p>analysis of the place of Achilles’ singing klea andrōn in his mēnis’ turning into philotēs</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.186-9.190","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.080405","title":"Iliad 9.186-9.189","body":"<p>analysis of the convergences between the (wording) of Sappho 44 and the Iliad and the application of the epithet theoeikelos in Sappho 44 to Hector and Andromache and its ominous dimension when analyzed in light of the Iliad, here also the transfer of the sorrows of Andromache to Achilles as he performs klea andrōn on Eëtion’s lyre</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.186-9.189","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.080450","title":"Iliad 9.192","body":"<p>analysis of the change of leader from Phoinix to Odysseus and the dual (I.09.192) in the passage on the embassy to Achilles</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.192","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.080517","title":"Iliad 9.193-9.198","body":"<p>Achilles greets the ambassadors in the dual, I.09.197–198, and not in the plural.

The story about these women as it is told here is then retold at I.09.270–272. The significance of the Aeolian identification of these women will be analyzed in the anchor comment that follows. The focus in the present comment, by contrast, is on the moral problems that are raised in the story about the actual capture of these women—and of other women in the <em>Iliad</em> who suffer the same fate of captivity. Two prominent examples are Briseis and Chryseis, captured by Achilles when he conquered the cities of Lyrnessos and Thēbē respectively, as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694. All these women—the seven unnamed ones and the two named ones—evidently became the common property of the Achaeans after being captured by Achilles, and it appears that Agamemnon as the Achaean over-king originally had a say, ostensibly by way of public deliberation with the rest of the Achaeans, in deciding which woman was allotted as a war-prize to which Achaean man. Even though all these women were captured by Achilles alone, they were thereafter to be distributed as war-prizes among the Achaean men as a group. In terms of this reconstruction of the story as outlined here, the role of Agamemnon in having a say about the awarding of these captive women as war-prizes is morally problematic. Likewise problematic is this over-king’s role in the original awarding of the captive woman Briseis, with the approval of the Achaeans, as a war-prize to Achilles—and in the parallel awarding of the captive woman Chryseis to himself. Moreover, the seizing of Briseis by Agamemnon after his loss of Chryseis is even more problematic. Here, then, is the overriding question to be asked about the treatment of all these women as war-prizes: is Agamemnon entitled to have a say in deciding which Achaean man will have sex with which woman? And the question can be broadened: are the Achaeans as a group entitled to make such decisions? Such a broader question extends also to Achilles.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.270-9.272","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Achilles the

By contrast, Achilles conquers 12 other cities not on foot but <em>sun nēusi</em> (σὺν νηυσί) ‘by way of ships’, I.09.328. Similarly at I.06.640–642, Hēraklēs had earlier conquered Troy itself <em>hex oiēis sun nēusi</em> (ἓξ οἴῃς σὺν νηυσί) ‘by way of merely six ships’, I.06.641. The analogous deed of Hēraklēs here leads me to think that Achilles too was conquering the 12 cities in the vicinity of Troy, whereas the other 11 cities would have been situated further south on the mainland of Asia Minor, that is, in the territory of the ancient Aeolian Dodecapolis. Herodotus 1.149.1 lists the cities of the Aeolian Dodecapolis, and one of them happens to be Killa. I think that this Killa is the same place that is mentioned twice in the <em>Iliad</em>, I.01.038 and I.01.452, in the context of Aeolian places that are specially sacred to Apollo. The two other places mentioned both times in those passages at I.01.038–039 and at I.01.451–452 are Chrysa and Tenedos. It has been argued that the Homeric Killa cannot be the same place as the Killa mentioned by Herodotus (Leaf 1923:310), but such arguments are based on the assumption that Homeric Killa was near Lyrnessos and Thēbē, two other places said to be conquered by Achilles. Herodotus 1.151.1 notes that the Aeolian cities on the mainland of northern Asia Minor in the region of Mount Ida—that is, in the general area of ancient Troy—were grouped separately from the Aeolian Dodecapolis, but he does not list those cities by name. The reason, I suspect, is that any federation of cities situated in this area would have been already severely disrupted by the Athenian empire in the fifth century BCE, that is, in the era of Herodotus, and, earlier, by the domination of this area by the Aeolian city of Mytilene in the seventh and the sixth centuries BCE. In that era, this city on the island of Lesbos was a major rival of Athens in seeking to possess the sacred real estate, so to speak, of ancient Troy and its environs.

Our point of departure is New Ilion, which in the historical period was an Aeolian city built over the ruins of the old Troy of the Trojan War as narrated in the epic that we know as the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. Archaeologists have verified that Hisarlık, which is the Turkish name for the site of New Ilion, was in fact the same place as the site of old Troy, which was also known in the ancient world as Ilion. [HPC 131]</p><p>Point 2. After a major destruction of the citadel at old Troy sometime around the beginning of the 12th century BCE, which marks the end of a phase that archaeologists recognize as Troy VIIa, the importance of the site was radically diminished, and things stayed that way through the phase known as Troy VIIb, lasting into the 10th century BCE. After Troy VIIb comes Troy VIII, which marks a “Greek era” extending all the way to the so-called “Roman era” that is Troy IX. In the earliest phase of Troy VIII, from the 10th to the mid-7th century BCE, a small population was occupying the area of the citadel, and, on the western side of the citadel wall, they left behind some archaeological remains of a “place of memory” that must have commemorated in some way the epic traditions of the Trojan War (Aslan and Rose 2013:11). At a later phase of Troy VIII, in the mid-7th century BCE, there was a destruction, to be followed in the late 7th century by a reoccupation. From this time onward, in the latest phase of Troy VIII, we see the beginnings of the historical period. Now the old Troy is on its way to becoming the new Troy, that is, New Ilion. [HPC 131.]</p><p>Point 3. As in modern times, the old Troy of New Ilion was sought out in antiquity, most prominently by rulers striving to link themselves with the heroes who fought in the Trojan War of the epic past. In 480 BCE, as we read in Herodotus 7.43.2, Xerxes the king of the Persian Empire traveled to New Ilion and made sacrifice there to the goddess Athena, and his magi made libations to the <em>hērōes</em> ‘heroes’ who were entombed in the environs. Over a century later, Alexander the Great likewise sacrificed to Athena in New Ilion (Strabo 13.1.26 C593; Arrian <em>Anabasis</em> 1.11.7). [HPC 131–132.]</p><p>Point 4. I highlight the term used by Herodotus here at 7.43.2 in referring to the goddess Athena as worshipped in her sacred space at New Ilion: she is <em>hē Ilias</em>, meaning something like ‘she who is in Ilion’. But the name can also be interpreted to mean ‘she who is in the Iliad’, in the sense that <em>Ilias</em> as an ‘Iliad’ means simply ‘the song about Ilion’. [HPC 126.] </p><p>Point 5. Elsewhere, at 5.122.2, Herodotus uses the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> in referring to <em>the territory of Ilion as inhabited by Aeolians</em>. The context is this: a Persian general was redeploying his forces at the time of the Ionian Revolt, ongoing in the first decade of the 5th century BCE, and he was moving his troops westward in the direction of the Hellespont (ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον). Then, along the way to the Hellespont, ‘he captured all the Aeolians who inhabit the territory of Ilion [<em>hē Ilias</em>]’ (καὶ εἷλε μὲν Αἰολέας πάντας ὅσοι τὴν Ἰλιάδα νέμονται). This detail from Herodotus concerning <em>hē Ilias</em> as ‘the territory of Ilion’ is a most valuable piece of evidence showing that New Ilion was at this time inhabited by <em>Aioleîs</em> ‘Aeolians’. I should add that there is a plethora of further evidence showing the Aeolian identity of New Ilion in the era of Troy VIII. [HPC 142–146.]</p><p>Point 6. But now we must confront a big complication. This New Ilion was not the only ‘new Ilion’. As early as the late seventh century BCE, a rival ‘new Ilion’ emerged, and its occupants claimed that their site replaced the real Troy of olden days. This alternative New Ilion was located not far from the old Troy, but it was a different site. The inherited name of the site was Sigeion, and it was situated on a promontory at Kum Kale, overlooking the entrance to the narrows of the Hellespont. Archaeologists have securely identified the site at Cape Yenişehir as Sigeion. [HPC 143; see the map at HPC 158.] </p><p>Point 7. Like the New Ilion that was built over the old Troy, the site of Sigeion used to be occupied by Aeolians. Also, for some time in the seventh century BCE, Sigeion had been dominated by one particular sub-group of Aeolians, namely, the elites of Mytilene, which was then the most powerful city in Lesbos, an Aeolian island situated due west across the sea from the Aeolian mainland of northern Asia Minor. As we read in Strabo 13.1.38 C599, the Mytilenaeans under the leadership of one Archeanax built the walls of the citadel of Sigeion from the stones of the ruined walls of the ancient citadel of Troy. Strabo thinks that this important piece of information validates arguments made in the second century BCE by the antiquarian Demetrius of Scepsis, who denied any continuity between the old Ilion and the city of New Ilion as it existed in his own day, claiming that there was no trace left of the old Ilion—and that the site of this old city was not New Ilion but rather a village located some 30 stadium-lenghts to the southeast, in the territory of Scepsis. In terms of the theory posited by Demetrius, all the stones of the old Ilion had been used up in the process of building the walls of other cities like Sigeion. But we have already seen at Point 2 that the stones of the old Ilion were in fact still very much in evidence throughout the phase known as Troy VIII, and so the theory of Demetrius is invalidated. See also the comment on I.07.433–465 on the myth about the building of the Trojan Wall by Poseidon and Apollo for Laomedon, who had been king of Troy before Priam, I.07.452–453. Still, the information reported by Demetrius and transmitted by Strabo about the re-using of stones from old Troy for the building of new Troys retains its full value. A shining example of another such new Troy was the Aeolian city of Neon Teikhos ‘New Wall’, which belonged to a confederation of twelve Aeolian cities situated on the mainland of Asia Minor and commonly known as the Aeolian Dodecapolis (Herodotus 1.149.1 lists them all). [HPC 145–146. About Neon Teikhos, see also HPC 180.]</p><p>Point 8. Unlike New Ilion, which remained an Aeolian site, the city of Sigeion underwent a drastic change in identity, and this happened already in the late seventh century BCE. Somewhere around that time, control of Sigeion was seized by the Ionian city of Athens and taken away from the Aeolian city of Mytilene-in-Lesbos, which had dominated Sigeion earlier, as we saw at Point 7. I cannot go into details here about this drastic change, but I will at least highlight the fact that Sigeion is pictured as already belonging to Athens in the poetry of Alcaeus, who can be dated to the late seventh century BCE. Herodotus notes that Alcaeus himself says in his own poetry that his armor was captured from him by the Athenians in a battle against the Mytilenaeans, and that it was displayed by the enemy at the <em>Athḗnaion</em> ‘sacred space of Athena’ in Sigeion. Here is the way Herodotus says it at 5.95.1: ‘the Athenians have his [= Alcaeus’] armor and they have hung it up for display at the space of Athena [<em>Athḗnaion</em>] in Sigeion’ (τὰ δέ οἱ ὅπλα ἴσχουσι Ἀθηναῖοι καί σφεα ἀνεκρέμασαν πρὸς τὸ Ἀθήναιον τὸ ἐν Σιγείῳ). Strabo quotes the words of Alcaeus telling about the captured armor, and these words actually give the name of Athena’s sacred space as <em>Glaukṓpion</em> (Alcaeus F 401B via Strabo 13.1.37 C600). This same name <em>Glaukṓpion</em>, derived from the sacred epithet of Athena <em>glaukôpis</em> ‘having the looks of the owl’, is attested in Athens as well. There it applies to the sacred space of Athena Nike at the southwest corner of the acropolis (Callimachus F 238.11), and this space, like the <em>Glaukṓpion</em> in Sigeion, can be dated at around 600 BCE. On the protracted war between the Athenians and the Mytilenaeans over the possession of Sigeion, I cite the primary sources here: Herodotus (5.94–95), Strabo (13.1.38–39 C599–600), and Diogenes Laertius (1.74); a most admirable secondary source is Aloni 1986. [HPC 142–146.]</p><p>Point 9. Just as Athena had a sacred space in the new Ilion of Sigeion, so also she had her own sacred space in the New Ilion built on top of the old Troy, where as we have already read in Herodotus 7.43.2 the goddess was worshipped as <em>hē Ilias</em>, meaning not only ‘she who is in Ilion’ but also ‘she who is in the Iliad’. As noted at Point 4, such an ‘Iliad’ was not the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> that we have but instead ‘the song about Ilion’ as it was known then—and as it was known even earlier when the occupants of Troy VIII were already venerating a “place of memory” commemorating the epic traditions of the Trojan War, as we saw at Point 2. [HPC 131.]</p><p>Point 10. There may be some uncertainties about positively identifying an earlier version of ‘Iliadic’ Athena—<em>hē Ilias</em>—as the goddess who presided over the “place of memory” in the early phases of Troy VIII, but we can be quite certain about the actual linking of the old Troy with epic traditions about an old Troy. And here again the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> applies: at Point 5, we already saw that Herodotus 5.122.2 says <em>hē Ilias</em> in referring to the territory of Ilion as inhabited by <em>Aioleîs</em> ‘Aeolians’. But now we will see that Herodotus also uses the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> in a context where he refers to a territory belonging not only to Ilion but also to the Iliadic tradition of poetry. The context is this: Herodotus is describing a scene where representatives of the cities of Mytilene and Athens, which have evidently already fought in many wars over the possession of Sigeion, are submitting their dispute to inter-state arbitration, and now the Aeolians of Mytilene are demanding that the Athenians give back to them the territory of Sigeion and its environs (Herodotus 5.94.2): ‘You see, the Mytilenaeans and the Athenians had been waging war with each other for the longest time. One side [= the Mytilenaeans] operated out of the city [<em>polis</em>] of Akhílleion and the other side [= the Athenians], out of Sigeion. They [= the Mytilenaeans] were demanding the return of the territory [<em>khōrā</em>], but the Athenians rejected the demand, trying to demonstrate by way of what they said that the Aeolians were no more entitled to the Iliadic territory [<em>hē Ilias khōrā</em>] than were they [= the Athenians] and all the other Hellenes who had joined forces in avenging Menelaos for the abduction of Helen’ (ἐπολέμεον γὰρ ἔκ τε Ἀχιλληίου πόλιος ὁρμώμενοι καὶ Σιγείου ἐπὶ χρόνον συχνὸν Μυτιληναῖοί τε καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι, οἱ μὲν ἀπαιτέοντες τὴν χώρην, Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ οὔτε συγγινωσκόμενοι ἀποδεικνύντες τε λόγῳ οὐδὲν μᾶλλον Αἰολεῦσι μετεὸν τῆς Ἰλιάδος χώρης ἢ οὐ καὶ σφίσι καὶ τοῖσι ἄλλοισι, ὅσοι Ἑλλήνων συνεπρήξαντο Μενέλεῳ τὰς Ἑλένης ἁρπαγάς). As the wording of Herodotus indicates, the Aeolian city of Mytilene in Lesbos claimed to be representing all Aeolic-speaking Hellenes in claiming possession of the Iliadic territory of Sigeion in the Troad. By contrast, the city of Athens claimed to be representing all Hellenes who took part in the Trojan War.

It would last only until the hero’s age runs out of time, just as the age of a plant will surely run out of time.

The analysis here will focus first on the general sense of ‘imperishable’ and then on the specific sense of ‘unwilting’. The Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ here at I.09.413 is parallel to the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7 (full argumentation in GMP 123–126). From the standpoint of the formulaic system inherited by Homeric diction, the function of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> in combination with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ in the expression <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413 can be not only predicative, ‘the glory will be imperishable’, but also attributive, ‘there will be a glory that is imperishable’. An attributive syntax is indicated by the shorter expression <em>kleos estai</em> (κλέος ἔσται), as at I.07.458, meaning ‘there will be a glory’. There is also the comparative evidence of the attributive syntax that we see at work in the cognate wording of Sappho Song 44.4, … <em>kleos aphthiton</em> (… κλέος ἄφθιτον) ‘imperishable glory’ (line-final), and of Ibycus S151.47, … <em>kleos aphthiton hexeis</em> (… κλέος ἄφθιτον ἑξεῖς) ‘you will have imperishable glory’ (line-final). On the other hand, the expression <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413 seems to be coefficient with the expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) as at I.02.325, ‘the glory will never perish’. See the comment on I.02.325. The syntax of <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> ‘the glory will never perish’, if we compare it to the syntax of <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> at I.09.413, may point to a predicative use of the adjective <em>aphthiton</em>: ‘the glory will be imperishable’. It has been suggested that the expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) ‘the glory will never perish’ could have been used instead of <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) even at I.09.413 if it were not for the fact that the word <em>ōleto</em> (ὤλετο) ‘perished’ (the subject is <em>nostos</em> ‘[safe] homecoming’) is already used at the beginning of the same verse. It does not follow, however, that the wording <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) instead of <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) at I.09.413 must be some kind of a reactive innovation: on the contrary, this wording can be an archaism that survives precisely for the stylistic purpose of avoiding an awkward duplication of wording in the same verse. As a general approach to poetics, I suggest that allowance should regularly be made for the possibility that older forms can be activated in situations where a more innovative equivalent form might create a poetically awkward side-effect (GMP 122–123). That said, my focus of analysis now shifts from the general sense of the adjective <em>aphthito</em>- as ‘imperishable’ to its specific sense as ‘unwilting’. This sense has already been noted in the comments on I.01.155, I.02.046, I.02.325. Unlike a plant that runs out of time, the <em>kleos</em> of poetic ‘glory’ is like an imperishable flower that will never wilt, never lose its vibrant color and aroma. Accordingly, the <em>kleos aphthiton</em> of Achilles will be like an unwilting flower. And the way for a hero to be adorned with such an unwilting flower is to experience a fated death. That is why the alternative of death in a choice between <em>kēres</em> ‘fates’ is the desired choice for the hero to make. And that is why the meaning of <em>kḗr</em> defaults to ‘a fated death’ as desired by heroes in the epic world of heroes. See again the overall comment on I.09.410–416. For Achilles, the <em>kleos aphthiton</em> ‘unwilting glory’ that he chooses is really an alternative form of life, while the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ that he ultimately rejects is an alternative form of death, since the name of his homeland is <em>Phthiē</em>, a “speaking name” (<em>nomen</em> <em>loquens</em>) that means literally ‘the land of wilting’. See the comment on I.01.155. See also HPC 168n67 on the ritualized idea of wearing garlands that are ‘unwilting’ in a Thessalian ritual that honors Achilles. By contrast with the hero Achilles, however, who chooses <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ instead of a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, the hero Odysseus does not need to make a choice.

The warning here is intended for Achilles. But why is it that Achilles should heed the <em>Litai</em>? An answer emerges at I.09.507, where the <em>Litai</em> are said to heal the damage caused by the <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that is committed by wrongdoers when these wrongdoers offer compensation for such <em>atē</em>. As we saw in the comment on I.09.115–120, Agamemnon admits his <em>atē</em> ‘aberration, for which he stands ready to offer <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.09.120.

For Achilles, such an <em>atē</em> would be the death of his other self, Patroklos, who personally experiences <em>atē</em> at the moment of his death, I.16.805, in the form of an aberration of the senses. See the comments on I.16.685–687 and on I.16.804–806.

The Greek word for such discourse is <em>ainos</em>, the meaning of which is impossible to translate by way of any single English word. For want of a better alternative, I define <em>ainos</em> pragmatically as ‘coded words’—a ‘coded message’. In the case of the story told by Phoenix, it is intended to carry a moral message for Achilles. The story is described, already at I.09.524, as <em>klea andrōn</em> | <em>hērōōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men who were heroes’. By convention, such an expression refers to song, especially to the medium of epic. We saw at I.09.185–191 a truncated version of this expression, <em>klea andrōn</em>, ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men’, I.09.189, and the performer in that context was Achilles himself, singing his song while accompanying himself on the lyre. The male hero in the story of Phoenix, Meleagros, is like Achilles. He too is angry at his community, and he too has withdrawn from fighting in a war, leaving his own people in desperate trouble. Those who are near and dear to him now approach Meleagros, imploring him to return to the fight and making their appeals to him as suppliants. The narrative arranges the order of the suppliants in terms of the hero’s ascending scale of affection. Those who are starting off on the lower levels of this scale will be mentioned earlier, while those who end up on the higher levels will be mentioned later. So, the highest someone on this scale will be mentioned last. Near the top of the scale are the <em>hetairoi</em> ‘companions’ of Meleagros, I.09.585, who are described at I.09.586 as <em>philtatoi</em> ‘nearest and dearest’ to him. So also Phoenix thinks that he and his fellow ambassadors, as companions of Achilles, should be placed at the very top of his ascending scale of affection. But the highest person on the ascending scale of affection for Meleagros turns out to be his wife, named <em>Kleopatra</em>, I.09.556. Her name fits the moral message of the story, since <em>Kleopátrā</em> means ‘she who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors’. Thus Kleopatra is the very embodiment of the story described as <em>klea andrōn</em> | <em>hērōōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men who were heroes’, since heroes are figured as stylized ancestors of the community. But the question is, what meaning will this story have for Achilles? For this hero, the top of his own ascending scale of affection will turn out to be Patroklos, whose full name, <em>Patrokléēs</em>, has the same meaning as the name of <em>Kleopátrā</em>, but the two elements of the name, <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ and <em>pateres</em> ‘ancestors’ are in reverse. Each of the two names is a “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), and both names mean ‘he/she who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors’. Further, as noted in the comment for I.09.185–191, the etymology of the name <em>Patrokléēs</em> can be adjusted by way of interpreting the component <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ in the plural sense of the word, not only in the singular sense: ‘he who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’. And the same can be said for <em>Kleopátrā</em>: ‘she who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.524-9.599","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"ainos 'coded words; fable'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hetairos 'companion'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"philos 'near-and-dear'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ascending scale of affection"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"\"speaking name\" (nomen loquens)"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Kleopatra"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"name of Patroklos"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"klea andrōn | hērōōn ‘the glories [klea] of men who were heroes’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"houtō(s) ‘this is how’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"the story of Meleagros and Kleopatra"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.085829","title":"Iliad 9.524-9.526","body":"<p>analysis of Phoenix’s plea to Achilles (transitioning from Litai to story of Meleagros)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.524-9.526","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.085877","title":"Iliad 9.524-9.525","body":"<p>analysis of Hector’s and Andromache’s exchange and comparison with Kleopatre’s with Meleagros (I.09) and Achilles and Patroklos, and analysis of kleos, patēr, and philoi in these contexts (here, specifically on the semantics of the collocation of pater and kleos as ‘the kleos of the ancestors’)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.524-9.525","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.085924","title":"Iliad 9.528","body":"<p>analysis of Phoenix’s Meleagros story in terms of Kakridis’ folktale motif of the ascending scale of affection</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.528","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.085971","title":"Iliad 9.533-9.537","body":"<p>comment on the parallel between the loss of timē by Achilles in I.01 and Artemis’ being deprived of her share in a sacrifice, which qualifies as a dais in the Meleager story (Motto and Clark)</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.533-9.537","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.086016","title":"Iliad 9.548","body":"<p>analysis of Phoenix’s Meleagros story in terms of Kakridis’ folktale motif of the ascending scale of affection</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.548","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.086063","title":"Iliad 9.555","body":"<p>analysis of Phoenix’s Meleagros story in terms of Kakridis’ folktale motif of the ascending scale of affection and distinguishing philoi who are family members from philoi in general</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.555","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.086111","title":"Iliad 9.556-9.557","body":"<p>analysis of Phoenix’s Meleagros story in terms of Kakridis’ folktale motif of the ascending scale of affection</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:9.556-9.557","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.086177","title":"Iliad 9.561–564","body":"<p>Here at I.09.561–564, it is revealed that Kleopatra had a second “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), and that this name had to do with the singing of laments.
