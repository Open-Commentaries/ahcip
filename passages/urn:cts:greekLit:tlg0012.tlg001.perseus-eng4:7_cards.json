Hektor threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound\n    in the neck under the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaukos, moreover, son of\n    Hippolokhos, leader of the Lycians, in hard hand-to-hand fight smote Iphinoos\n    son of Dexios on the shoulder, as he was springing on to his chariot behind his\n    fleet mares; so he fell to earth from the car, and there was no life left in\n    him. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"17\" unit=\"line\"/>When, therefore, Athena saw these men making\n    havoc of the Argives, she darted down to <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> from the summits of <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>, and Apollo, who was looking on from <placeName key=\"tgn,7016140\">Pergamos</placeName>, went out to meet her; for he wanted\n    the Trojans to be victorious. The pair met by the oak tree, and King Apollo son\n    of Zeus was first to speak. \"What would you have said he, \"daughter of great\n    Zeus, that your proud spirit has sent you hither from <placeName key=\"tgn,7011019\">Olympus</placeName>?

Bid the other Trojans and Achaeans all of them take their seats,\n    and challenge the best man among the Achaeans to meet you in single combat.

But Athena\n    and Apollo, in the likeness of vultures, perched on father Zeus' high oak tree,\n    proud of their men; and the ranks sat close ranged together, bristling with\n    shield and helmet and spear. As when the rising west wind furs the face of the\n    sea [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">pontos</term>] and the waters grow dark beneath it,\n    so sat the companies of Trojans and Achaeans upon the plain.

May you be turned every man of\n    you into earth and water as you sit spiritless and inglorious in your places.

King Agamemnon caught him by the right hand\n    and said, \"Menelaos, you are mad; a truce to this folly. Be patient in spite of\n    passion, do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as\n    Hektor son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"114\" unit=\"line\"/>Even Achilles, who is far more doughty than you\n    are, shrank from meeting him in battle. Sit down your own people, and the\n    Achaeans will send some other champion to fight Hektor; fearless and fond of\n    battle though he be, I ween his knees will bend gladly under him if he comes\n    out alive from the struggle of this fight.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"120\" unit=\"line\"/>With these words of reasonable counsel he\n    persuaded his brother, whereon his squires [therapontes] gladly stripped the\n    armor from off his shoulders. Then Nestor rose and spoke, \"For sure,\" said he,\n    \"grief [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">penthos</term>] has befallen the Achaean land. The\n    old horseman Peleus, counselor and orator among the Myrmidons, loved when I was\n    in his house to question me concerning the race and lineage of all the Argives.\n    How would it not grieve him could he hear of them as now quailing before\n    Hektor? Many a time would he lift his hands in prayer that his soul might leave\n    his body and go down within the house of Hades. Would, by father Zeus, Athena,\n    and Apollo, that I were still young and strong as when the Pylians and\n    Arcadians were gathered in fight by the rapid river Keladon under the walls of\n    <placeName key=\"perseus,Pheia\">Pheia</placeName>, and round about the waters\n    of the river Iardanos. The godlike hero Ereuthalion stood forward as their\n    champion, with the armor of King Areithoos upon his shoulders - Areithoos whom\n    men and women had surnamed ‘the Mace-man,’ because he fought neither with bow\n    nor spear, but broke the battalions of the foe with his iron mace. Lycurgus\n    killed him, not in fair fight, but by entrapping him in a narrow way where his\n    mace served him in no stead; for Lycurgus was too quick for him and speared him\n    through the middle, so he fell to earth on his back. Lycurgus then spoiled him\n    of the armor which Ares had given him, and bore it in battle thenceforward; but\n    when he grew old and stayed at home, he gave it to his faithful squire [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">therapôn</term>] Ereuthalion, who in this same armor\n    challenged the foremost men among us.

He was the biggest and strongest man that ever I killed, and covered\n    much ground as he lay sprawling upon the earth. Would that I were still young\n    and strong as I then was, for the son of Priam would then soon find one who\n    would face him. But you, foremost among the whole host though you be, have none\n    of you any stomach for fighting Hektor.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"161\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did the old man rebuke them, and forthwith\n    nine men started to their feet. Foremost of all stood up King Agamemnon, and\n    after him brave Diomedes the son of Tydeus. Next were the two Ajaxes, men\n    clothed in valor as with a garment, and then Idomeneus, and Meriones his\n    brother in arms. After these Eurypylos son of Euaemon, Thoas the son of\n    Andraimon, and Odysseus also rose. Then Nestor horseman of Gerene again spoke,\n    saying: \"Cast lots among you to see who shall be chosen. If he come alive out\n    of this fight he will have done good service alike to his own soul and to the\n    Achaeans.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"175\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus he spoke, and when each of them had marked\n    his lot, and had thrown it into the helmet of Agamemnon son of Atreus, the\n    people lifted their hands in prayer, and thus would one of them say as he\n    looked into the vault of heaven, \"Father Zeus, grant that the lot fall on Ajax,\n    or on the son of Tydeus, or upon the king of rich <placeName key=\"perseus,Mycenae\">Mycenae</placeName> himself.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"181"},{"n":"181","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"181\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"181\" unit=\"line\"/>As they were speaking, Nestor horseman of\n    Gerene shook the helmet, and from it there fell the very lot which they wanted\n    - the lot of Ajax. The herald bore it about and showed it to all the chieftains\n    of the Achaeans, going from left to right; but they none of them owned it.\n    When, however, in due course he reached the man who had written upon it and had\n    put it into the helmet, brave Ajax held out his hand, and the herald gave him\n    the lot. When Ajax saw his mark [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] he knew it\n    and was glad; he threw it to the ground and said, \"My friends, the lot is mine,\n    and I rejoice, for I shall vanquish Hektor. I will put on my armor;</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"194\" unit=\"line\"/>meanwhile, pray to King Zeus in silence among\n    yourselves that the Trojans may not hear you - or aloud if you will, for we\n    fear no man. None shall overcome me, neither by force nor cunning, for I was\n    born and bred in <placeName key=\"tgn,7002340\">Salamis</placeName>, and can hold\n    my own in all things.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"200\" unit=\"line\"/>With this they fell praying to King Zeus the\n    son of Kronos, and thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of\n    heaven, \"Father Zeus, you who rule from Ida, most glorious in power, grant\n    victory to Ajax, and let him win great glory: but if you wish well to Hektor\n    also and would protect him, grant to each of them equal fame and prowess. Thus\n    they prayed, and Ajax armed himself in his suit of gleaming bronze. When he was\n    in full array he sprang forward as monstrous Ares when he takes part among men\n    whom Zeus has set fighting with one another - even so did huge Ajax, bulwark of\n    the Achaeans, spring forward with a grim smile on his face as he brandished his\n    long spear and strode onward. The Argives were elated as they beheld him, but\n    the Trojans trembled in every limb, and the heart even of Hektor beat quickly,\n    but he could not now retreat and withdraw into the ranks behind him, for he had\n    been the challenger. Ajax came up bearing his shield in front of him like a\n    wall - a shield of bronze with seven folds of oxhide - the work of Tychios, who\n    lived in Hyle and was by far the best worker in leather. He had made it with\n    the hides of seven full-fed bulls, and over these he had set an eighth layer of\n    bronze. Holding this shield before him, Ajax son of Telamon came close up to\n    Hektor, and menaced him saying, \"Hektor, you shall now learn, man to man, what\n    kind of champions the Danaans have among them even besides lion-hearted\n    Achilles cleaver of the ranks of men. He now abides at the ships in anger with\n    Agamemnon shepherd of his people, but there are many of us who are well able to\n    face you; therefore begin the fight.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"233\" unit=\"line\"/>And Hektor answered, \"Noble Ajax, son of\n    Telamon, leader of the host, treat me not as though I were some puny boy or\n    woman that cannot fight.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"236\" unit=\"line\"/>I have been long used to the blood and\n    butcheries of battle. I am quick to turn my leathern shield either to right or\n    left, for this I deem the main thing in battle. I can charge among the chariots\n    and horsemen, and in hand to hand fighting can delight the heart of Ares;\n    howbeit I would not take such a man as you are off his guard - but I will smite\n    you openly if I can.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"244\" unit=\"line\"/>He poised his spear as he spoke, and hurled it\n    from him. It struck the sevenfold shield in its outermost layer - the eighth,\n    which was of bronze - and went through six of the layers but in the seventh\n    hide it stayed. Then Ajax threw in his turn, and struck the round shield of the\n    son of Priam. The terrible spear went through his gleaming shield, and pressed\n    onward through his cuirass of cunning workmanship; it pierced the shirt against\n    his side, but he swerved and thus saved his life. They then each of them drew\n    out the spear from his shield, and fell on one another like savage lions or\n    wild boars of great strength and endurance: the son of Priam struck the middle\n    of Ajax's shield, but the bronze did not break, and the point of his dart was\n    turned. Ajax then sprang forward and pierced the shield of Hektor; the spear\n    went through it and staggered him as he was springing forward to attack; it\n    gashed his neck and the blood came pouring from the wound, but even so Hektor\n    did not cease fighting; he gave ground, and with his brawny hand seized a\n    stone, rugged and huge, that was lying upon the plain; with this he struck the\n    shield of Ajax on the boss that was in its middle, so that the bronze rang\n    again. But Ajax in turn caught up a far larger stone, swung it aloft, and\n    hurled it with prodigious force. This millstone of a rock broke Hektor's shield\n    inwards and threw him down on his back with the shield crushing him under\n    it,</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"272\" unit=\"line\"/>but Apollo raised him at once. Thereon they\n    would have hacked at one another in close combat with their swords, had not\n    heralds, messengers of gods and men, come forward, one from the Trojans and the\n    other from the Achaeans - Talthybios and Idaios both of them honorable men;\n    these parted them with their staves, and the good herald Idaios said, \"My sons,\n    fight no longer, you are both of you valiant, and both are dear to Zeus; we\n    know this; but night is now falling, and the behests of night may not be well\n    gainsaid.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"283\" unit=\"line\"/>Ajax son of Telamon answered, \"Idaios, bid\n    Hektor say so, for it was he that challenged our princes.

Let us for this day cease fighting; hereafter we will\n    fight anew till a <term xml:lang=\"grc\">daimôn</term> decides between us, and\n    give victory to one or to the other; night is now falling, and the behests of\n    night may not be well gainsaid. Gladden, then, the hearts of the Achaeans at\n    your ships, and more especially those of your own followers and clansmen, while\n    I, in the great city of King Priam, bring comfort to the Trojans and their\n    women, who vie with one another in their prayers directed at me. Let us,\n    moreover, exchange presents that it may be said among the Achaeans and Trojans,\n    ‘They fought with might and main, but were reconciled and parted in\n    friendship.’ </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"303\" unit=\"line\"/>On this he gave Ajax a silver-studded sword\n    with its sheath and leathern Balearic, and in return Ajax gave him a belt dyed\n    with purple. Thus they parted, the one going to the host of the Achaeans, and\n    the other to that of the Trojans, who rejoiced when they saw their hero come to\n    them safe and unharmed from the strong hands of mighty Ajax. They led him,\n    therefore, to the city as one that had been saved beyond their hopes. On the\n    other side the Achaeans brought Ajax elated with victory to Agamemnon. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"313\" unit=\"line\"/>When they reached the quarters of the son of\n    Atreus, Agamemnon sacrificed for them a five-year-old bull in honor of Zeus the\n    son of Kronos. They flayed the carcass, made it ready, and divided it into\n    joints; these they cut carefully up into smaller pieces, putting them on the\n    spits, roasting them sufficiently, and then drawing them off. When they had\n    done all this and had prepared the feast, they ate it, and every man had his\n    full and equal share, so that all were satisfied, and King Agamemnon gave Ajax\n    some slices cut lengthwise down the loin, as a mark of special honor. As soon\n    as they had had enough to eat and drink, old Nestor whose counsel was ever\n    truest began to speak; with all sincerity and goodwill, therefore, he addressed\n    them thus: </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"327\" unit=\"line\"/>\"Son of Atreus, and other chieftains, inasmuch\n    as many of the Achaeans are now dead, whose blood Ares has shed by the banks of\n    the Skamandros, and their <term xml:lang=\"grc\">psukhai</term> have gone down to\n    the house of Hades, it will be well when morning comes that we should cease\n    fighting; we will then wheel our dead together with oxen and mules and burn\n    them not far from the ships, that when we sail hence we may take the bones of\n    our comrades home to their children. Hard by the funeral pyre we will build a\n    barrow that shall be raised from the plain for all in common; near this let us\n    set about building a high wall, to shelter ourselves and our ships, and let it\n    have well-made gates that there may be a way through them for our chariots.\n    Close outside we will dig a deep trench all round it to keep off both horse and\n    foot, that the Trojan chieftains may not bear hard upon us.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"344\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus he spoke, and the princes shouted in\n    approval.

The\n    Achaeans in like manner heaped their dead sadly and silently on the pyre, and\n    having burned them went back to their ships. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"433\" unit=\"line\"/>Now in the twilight when it was not yet dawn,\n    chosen bands of the Achaeans were gathered round the pyre and built one barrow\n    that was raised in common for all, and hard by this they built a high wall to\n    shelter themselves and their ships; they gave it strong gates that there might\n    be a way through them for their chariots, and close outside it they dug a\n    trench deep and wide, and they planted it within with stakes. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"444\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did the Achaeans toil, and the gods,\n    seated by the side of Zeus the lord of lightning, marveled at their great work;\n    but Poseidon, lord of the earthquake, spoke, saying, \"Father Zeus, what mortal\n    in the whole world will again take the gods into his counsel [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">noos</term>]? See you not how the Achaeans have built a wall\n    about their ships and driven a trench all round it, without offering hecatombs\n    to the gods? The fame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] of this wall will\n    reach as far as dawn itself, and men will no longer think anything of the one\n    which Phoebus Apollo and myself built with so much labor for Laomedon.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"455\" unit=\"line\"/>Zeus was displeased and answered, \"What, O\n    shaker of the earth, are you talking about? A god less powerful than yourself\n    might be alarmed at what they are doing, but your fame [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kleos</term>] reaches as far as dawn itself. Surely when the Achaeans have\n    gone home with their ships, you can shatter their wall and Ring it into the\n    sea; you can cover the beach with sand again, and the great wall of the\n    Achaeans will then be utterly effaced.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"464"},{"n":"464","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"464\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"464\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus did they converse, and by sunset the work\n    of the Achaeans was completed; they then slaughtered oxen at their tents and\n    got their supper.

The son of Jason freighted them with ten thousand measures\n    of wine, which he sent specially to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos.\n    From this supply the Achaeans bought their wine, some with bronze, some with\n    iron, some with hides, some with whole heifers, and some again with captives.\n    They spread a goodly banquet and feasted the whole night through, as also did\n    the Trojans and their allies in the city.</p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"477\" unit=\"line\"/>But all the time Zeus boded them ill and roared\n    with his portentous thunder.
