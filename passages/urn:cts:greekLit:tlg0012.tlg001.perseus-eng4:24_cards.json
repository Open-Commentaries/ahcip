This way and that did he turn\n    as he yearned after the might and manfulness of Patroklos; he thought of all\n    they had done together, and all they had gone through both on the field of\n    battle and on the waves of the weary sea. As he dwelt on these things he wept\n    bitterly and lay now on his side, now on his back, and now face downwards, till\n    at last he rose and went out as one distraught to wander upon the seashore.\n    Then, when he saw dawn breaking over beach and sea, he yoked his horses to his\n    chariot, and bound the body of Hektor behind it that he might drag it about.\n    Thrice did he drag it round the tomb [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] of the\n    son of Menoitios, and then went back into his tent, leaving the body on the\n    ground full length and with its face downwards.

But when Achilles was now sated\n    with grief </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"513\" unit=\"line\"/>and had unburdened the bitterness of his\n    sorrow, he left his seat and raised the old man by the hand, in pity for his\n    white hair and beard; then he said, \"Unhappy man, you have indeed been greatly\n    daring; how could you venture to come alone to the ships of the Achaeans, and\n    enter the presence of him who has slain so many of your brave sons? You must\n    have iron courage: sit now upon this seat, and for all our grief we will hide\n    our sorrows in our hearts, for weeping will not avail us. The immortals know no\n    care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus'\n    palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with\n    good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will\n    meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none\n    but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine\n    will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face\n    of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men. Even so did it befall Peleus;\n    the gods endowed him with all good things from his birth upwards, for he\n    reigned over the Myrmidons excelling all men in prosperity [olbos] and wealth,\n    and mortal though he was they gave him a goddess for his bride. But even on him\n    too did heaven send misfortune, for there is no race of royal children born to\n    him in his house, save one son who is doomed to die all untimely; nor may I\n    take care of him now that he is growing old, for I must stay here at <placeName key=\"perseus,Troy\">Troy</placeName> to be the bane of you and your children.\n    And you too, O Priam, I have heard that you were aforetime happy [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">olbios</term>].

These unyoked the horses and mules, and bade Priam's\n    herald and attendant be seated within the house. They lifted the ransom for\n    Hektor's body from the wagon. but they left two mantles and a goodly shirt,\n    that Achilles might wrap the body in them when he gave it to be taken home.\n    Then he called to his servants and ordered them to wash the body and anoint it,\n    but he first took it to a place where Priam should not see it, lest if he did\n    so, he should break out in the bitterness of his grief, and enrage Achilles,\n    who might then kill him and err against the word of Zeus. When the servants had\n    washed the body and anointed it, and had wrapped it in a fair shirt and mantle,\n    Achilles himself lifted it on to a bier, and he and his men then laid it on the\n    wagon. He cried aloud as he did so and called on the name of his dear comrade,\n    \"Be not angry with me, Patroklos,\" he said, \"if you hear even in the house of\n    Hades that I have given Hektor to his father for a ransom.

Even lovely Niobe had to think about eating, though her\n    twelve children - six daughters and six lusty sons - had been all slain in her\n    house. Apollo killed the sons with arrows from his silver bow, to punish Niobe,\n    and Artemis slew the daughters, because Niobe had vaunted herself against Leto;\n    she said Leto had borne two children only, whereas she had herself borne many -\n    whereon the two killed the many. Nine days did they lie weltering, and there\n    was none to bury them, for the son of Kronos turned the people into stone; but\n    on the tenth day the gods in heaven themselves buried them, and Niobe then took\n    food, being worn out with weeping. They say that somewhere among the rocks on\n    the mountain pastures of Sipylos, where the nymphs live that haunt the river\n    Akheloos, there, they say, she lives in stone and still nurses the sorrows sent\n    upon her by the hand of heaven. Therefore, noble sir, let us two now take food;\n    you can weep for your dear son hereafter as you are bearing him back to\n    <placeName key=\"tgn,7002329\">Ilion</placeName> - and many a tear will he\n    cost you.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"621\" unit=\"line\"/>With this Achilles sprang from his seat and\n    killed a sheep of silvery whiteness, which his followers skinned and made ready\n    all in due order [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">kosmos</term>]. They cut the meat\n    carefully up into smaller pieces, spitted them, and drew them off again when\n    they were well roasted. Automedon brought bread in fair baskets and served it\n    round the table, while Achilles dealt out the meat, and they laid their hands\n    on the good things that were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat\n    and drink, Priam, descendant of <placeName key=\"perseus,Dardanos\">Dardanos</placeName>, marveled at the strength and beauty of Achilles for\n    he was as a god to see, and Achilles marveled at Priam as he listened to him\n    and looked upon his noble presence. When they had gazed their fill Priam spoke\n    first. \"And now, O king,\" he said, \"take me to my couch that we may lie down\n    and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.

When another would chide with\n    me, as it might be one of your brothers or sisters or of your brothers' wives,\n    or my mother-in-law - for Priam was as kind to me as though he were my own\n    father - you would rebuke and check them with words of gentleness and goodwill.\n    Therefore my tears flow both for you and for my unhappy self, for there is no\n    one else in Troy who is kind to me, but all shrink and shudder as they go by\n    me.\" </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"776\" unit=\"line\"/>She wept as she spoke and the vast population\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">dêmos</term>] that was gathered round her joined in\n    her lament. Then King Priam spoke to them saying, \"Bring wood, O Trojans, to\n    the city, and fear no cunning ambush of the Argives, for Achilles when he\n    dismissed me from the ships gave me his word that they should not attack us\n    until the morning of the twelfth day.\" </p>\n    </div>","next_n":"782"},{"n":"782","xml_content":"<div type=\"textpart\" n=\"782\" subtype=\"card\">\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"782\" unit=\"line\"/>Forthwith they yoked their oxen and mules and\n    gathered together before the city. Nine days long did they bring in great heaps\n    wood, and on the morning of the tenth day with many tears they took brave\n    Hektor forth, laid his dead body upon the summit of the pile, and set the fire\n    thereto. Then when the child of morning rosy-fingered dawn appeared on the\n    eleventh day, the people again assembled, round the pyre of mighty Hektor. When\n    they were got together, they first quenched the fire with wine wherever it was\n    burning, and then his brothers and comrades with many a bitter tear gathered\n    his white bones, wrapped them in soft robes of purple, and laid them in a\n    golden urn, which they placed in a grave [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] and\n    covered over with large stones set close together. Then they built a tomb\n    [<term xml:lang=\"grc\">sêma</term>] hurriedly over it keeping guard on every\n    side lest the Achaeans should attack them before they had finished. When they\n    had heaped up the barrow they went back again into the city, and being well\n    assembled they held high feast in the house of Priam their king. </p>\n\n    <p>\n    <milestone n=\"804\" unit=\"line\"/>Thus, then, did they celebrate the funeral of\n    Hektor tamer of horses.</p>\n    </div>","next_n":"end"}]
