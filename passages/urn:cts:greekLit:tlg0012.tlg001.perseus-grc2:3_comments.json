Quarreling happens, as indicated here by way of the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’. Positive things about each warrior need to be praised, but negative things need to be blamed. At stake for each contending warrior-hero is the honor that he is apportioned in the course of any contention, and the contention itself is expressed by way of negative and positive speech, that is, by way of blame and praise respectively. Such an apportioning of honor is the essence of a warrior-hero’s aisa, which is visualized not only as a portion of plundered goods that gets apportioned to each warrior after such goods are communally divided (as at I.18.327) but also, in general, as a warrior’s ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.01.416, and so on). The same can be said about the word <em>moira</em>, which can mean not only a ‘portion’ of plundered goods (as at O.11.534) or even of sacrificial meat (as at O.03.066) but also, in general, ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.06.488, and so on). What is at stake, in the long run, is the aisa or moira of each contending warrior-hero. And this <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em>, in the sense of a ‘portion’ that is being apportioned, becomes the warrior’s ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’ in the poetry that tells about him. To restate in colloquial English: <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> becomes the “bone of contention” in the language of praise and blame. Here at I.03.059 as also at I.06.333, Paris actually accepts the words of blame directed at him by his quarreling brother. He says that these words fit his own <em>aisa</em>, admitting that Hector’s words of blame here are <em>kat’ aisan</em> ‘in accord with <em>aisa’</em> (κατ’ αἶσαν) and not <em>huper aisan</em> ‘in disaccord with <em>aisa’</em> (ὑπὲρ αἶσαν). We find in Homeric diction comparable combinations of <em>moira</em>, synonym of <em>aisa</em>, with the same adverbs/prepositions <em>kata</em> ‘in accord with’ and <em>huper</em> ‘in disaccord with’, as for example in the case of <em>kata moiran</em> at I.09.059 (κατὰ μοῖραν) and <em>huper moiran</em> at I.20.336 (ὑπὲρ μοῖραν). Further, when the actual words of praise or blame fit the <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> of a given warrior-hero, they will fit not only his destiny but even the overall plot of the epic, as at I.16.707 in the case of <em>aisa</em> and at Ι.16.853 in the case of <em>moira</em>. The plot of epic has a destiny of its own, and this overarching destiny integrates all the individual destinies of the heroes who populate the epic.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.59","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"language of praise/blame"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikeîn ‘quarrel with’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aisa 'portion; fate, destiny'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"moira 'portion; fate, destiny'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"plot of the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.050563","title":"Iliad 3.98","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of diakridon, and the disengagement of armies (as in this line) as an example of it</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.98","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.050626","title":"Iliad 3.100","body":"<p>The Trojan War is <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. See also <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at Pindar <em>Paean</em> 6.50–53. That is how this war is seen in the words of Menelaos the Achaean, who claims a juridical grievance on the part of the Achaeans against the Trojans. In terms of the thinking revealed by these words, the beginning of the strife was the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaos the Achaean, by Paris the Trojan. Accentuating the idea that this juridical grievance of Menelaos was an affair of state is the reference to Paris here by way of his princely name, Alexandros. In royal Hittite correspondences where the Hittite king speaks to and about the king of Ahhiyawa—which is the Hittite way of referring to the land of the Achaeans—we find occasional references to a princely figure by the name of <em>Alaksandu</em>, which is the Hittite pronunciation of Alexandros (Nagy 2015.07.22§25). By contrast, the name <em>Paris</em> is on the surface merely a shepherd’s name (on the symbolism, however, of the shepherd as a king-in-the-making, see Nagy 2009:309). In any case, the <em>eris</em> or ‘strife’ between the Achaeans and the Trojans was caused by ‘my strife’— according to Menelaos the Achaean. To say it more precisely in his words, the Trojan War was ‘because of my strife’ (εἵνεκ’ ἐμῆς ἔριδος). Correspondingly, the <em>arkhē</em> or ‘beginning’ of the strife as begun by Paris=Alexandros was ‘his beginning’ of that strife. To say it again more precisely in the words of Menelaos, the beginning of the Trojan War was ‘because of the beginning on the part of Paris=Alexandros’ (Ἀλεξάνδρου ἕνεκ’ ἀρχῆς). Here it is important to compare what was narrated in the <em>Cypria</em>, which as an epic belonging to a set of epics known as the epic Cycle. In the <em>Cypria</em> of the epic Cycle as also in the <em>Iliad</em>, the Trojan War is likewise seen as <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. As we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em> in Proclus 102.13–19 (ed. Allen 1912), it all began at a feast celebrating the marriage of Thetis and Peleus—a marriage that led to the conception of Achilles himself. It was the Will of Zeus that <em>Eris</em> ‘Strife’ personified would bring about a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ among the gods that would ultimately result in the Trojan War (Proclus 102.14/15 on <em>Eris</em>/<em>neikos</em>). As we see further in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em>, Proclus 102.14–19, the Eris/neikos extends to the figure of Paris, who has to choose from among Hērā, Athena, and Aphrodite, <em>Cypria</em>/Proclus 102.14–19. This Judgment of Paris is recapitulated at I.24.025–030: the fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽). These verbs <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ express both the social and the poetic significance of praise and blame respectively.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.100","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Paris=Alexandros"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"eris  'strife'"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"arkhē ‘beginning’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"neikeîn ‘quarrel with’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aineîn ‘praise’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"language of praise/blame"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"abduction of Helen"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Epic Cycle"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.050672","title":"Iliad 3.102","body":"<p>analysis of the meaning of diakridon, and the disengagement of armies (as in this line) as an example of it</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.102","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.050729","title":"Iliad 3.125-3.128","body":"<p>Helen is seen here at I.03.125–128 for the first time in the <em>Iliad</em>.

Another name for them is Dioskouroi ‘sons of Zeus’. Kastōr and Poludeukēs are also mentioned at O.11.300. The wording of I.03.237 and of O.11.300 is cognate with the wording we find a fragment of Stesichorus: see PH 458. (On the etymology of <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, I epitomize from PasP 51.) The noun <em>Poludeúkēs</em> as a name is straightforwardly related to the adjective <em>poludeukḗs</em>, in that the recessive accent of the name is typical of the naming function, as we see from such morphologically related formations as <em>Poluneíkēs</em> ‘having many quarrels [es-stem <em>neîkos</em>]’ or ‘having quarrels in many different ways’ (or ‘many times’). In the mythological functions of the divine figure <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, the idea of continuity, conveyed by the root *<em>deuk</em>-, seems as evident as that of variety, since the Divine Twins are models of consistency, perseverance, reliability (as in <em>Homeric Hymn</em> 33). In an astrological sense, we could say that <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, in the role of Morning Star, is ‘repeating many times’, the symbol of many happy returns.

In general, this epithet is applied to the following goddesses: Aphrodite, as here at I.03.374, also at I.05.131 and I.05.312; Athena at I.02.548 and I.04.128 and I.04.515; Artemis at O.20.061; Persephone at O.11.217; Ate at I.19.091; the Muses at I.02.491–492 (plural) and O.01.010 (singular); finally, Helen at O.04.227 (see the comment there). This epithet <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ is cognate with Vedic Sanskrit<em> divás duhitár-</em> (/ <em>duhitár- divás</em>) ‘daughter of the sky[-god]’, epithet of <em>Uṣas</em>-, goddess of the dawn, whose name actually means ‘dawn’. The Greek divinities Eos and Helios—<em>Ēōs</em> means ‘Dawn’ and <em>Hēlios</em> means ‘Sun’—are comparable to (and cognate with) the Indic divinities <em>Uṣas</em>- ‘Dawn’ and <em>Sūrya</em>- ‘Sun’. In Homeric diction, however, Eos the goddess of the dawn is never described by the epithet <em>thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, and this fact corresponds to another fact: Homeric tradition preserves no myth about Eos as a daughter of Zeus. Eos is conventionally described as <em>rhododaktulos</em> ‘rosy-fingered’, an epithet that has the same metrical shape as <em>thugatēr Dios</em>, uu–uu. For more on <em>rhododaktulos</em> as an epithet for Eos the goddess of the dawn, see the comment at O.12.1–010 on Ōkeanos. </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.374","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios ‘daughter of Zeus’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052165","title":"Iliad 3.429","body":"<p>analysis of the development of Greek posis compared with Vedic pati-</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.429","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052218","title":"Iliad 3.431","body":"<p>example of the hand as a regular metonym of the warrior’s destructive force, biē</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.431","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052266","title":"Iliad 3.18a","body":"<p>comparison of Didymus’ and Aristonicus’ comments on the verse, in the context of the analysis of the reinterpretation of Aristarchus’ descriptions as prescriptions by later Aristarcheans [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052341","title":"Iliad 3.338a","body":"<p>in the list of West’s (2001:40n33) list of plus-verses, in the context of analyzing plus-verses in Zenodotus’ (vs. Aristarchus’) text of Homer and Zenodotus’ deletion as well as athetesis of them [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052387","title":"Iliad 3.206a","body":"<p>an example where ‘Homeric’ usage is clearly distinct from what is sunēthēs ‘customary’ for Aristarchus and his contemporaries [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052433","title":"Iliad 3.18b2","body":"<p>example of the reinterpretation of Aristarchus’ descriptions as prescriptions by later Aristarcheans [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052490","title":"Iliad 3.99a","body":"<p>an example where ‘Homeric’ usage is clearly distinct from what is sunēthēs ‘customary’ for Aristarchus and his contemporaries [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052535","title":"Iliad 3.18b1","body":"<p>example of the reinterpretation of Aristarchus’ descriptions as prescriptions by later Aristarcheans [MRBTP: scholia]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.052580","title":"Iliad 3.18a","body":"<p>note that khariestátē is used in the scholia to in textual analysis [MRBTP: A]</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:3.999","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]}]
