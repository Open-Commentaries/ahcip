Achilles, best of the Achaeans, sends out his other self, Patroklos, to fight Hector and his Trojans, who are now on the verge of setting on fire and destroying all the beached ships of the Achaeans. Patroklos does in fact succeed in stopping the fire, which had been endangering not only the survival of the Achaeans but even the very existence of their notional descendants, imagined as the Greeks who are listening to the story of the <em>Iliad</em> in their own time. The conflagration that could have burned down the beached ships of the Achaeans is now literally ‘quenched’ by Patroklos, whose heroic action in putting out the fire of the Trojans is compared in a simile to a cosmic action taken by Zeus himself when this weather-god drenches and thus destroys in a violent rainstorm the farmlands of unjust men. Clearly, Zeus is now once again on the Achaean side of the Trojan War. But the success of Patroklos is not to last: soon after he kills Sarpedon, son of Zeus himself, in the course of a spectacular chariot fight, Patroklos now gets killed in the course of a second spectacular chariot fight. This time, Patroklos has gone too far, daring to attack not only Hector but also the divine protector of that hero, Apollo himself. Now everything is about to come apart again, and Achilles has yet to find out about the tragedy that awaits him.</p><p></p><span><img src=\"https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Terracotta_biga_Louvre_CA2959_1280.jpg\" alt=\"draft js image error\"/></span><p>A chariot driver and a chariot fighter in a <em>biga</em> (two-horses chariot).

There is a manifestation of the heroic type represented by the Bronze Men of Hesiod in the heroic character of Achilles himself, and more specifically, in the spear he wields. In fact, Achilles is described as the only hero who could wield this magnificent spear (I.16.140–142), which is also the only piece of the hero's armor that Patroklos did not take with him when he fatally replaced Achilles.

Here I give an epitome of a far more detailed argumentation in Nagy 2012:60–69. In terms of hero cult, the wording that refers here at I.16.456–457 to a funeral and an entombment implies a ritual preparing of the dead body for a mystical revival after death. The word that refers to such immortalization in these Homeric passages is <em>tarkhuein</em> (ταρχύσουσι), at I.07.085, I.16.456, I.16.674. It can be argued that this Greek word <em>tarkhuein</em>, which I translate here neutrally as ‘ritually prepare’, is a borrowing from the Anatolian language that we know as Lycian, and that the corresponding Lycian word conveys the idea of ‘immortalize’. The most relevant forms in the surviving corpus of Anatolian linguistic evidence are (1) Lycian <em>Trqqñt</em>-, name of a Lycian thunder god; (2) the cognate Luvian form <em>Tarḫunt</em>-, name of the thunder god who is head of the Luvian pantheon; (3) the cognate Hittite form <em>tarḫu</em>-/<em>tar(r)uḫ</em>- (/<em>tarxw</em>-/), a verb meaning ‘be victorious, overcome’. Cognates of this Hittite verb <em>tarḫu</em>- in other Indo-European languages convey the idea of ‘overcome’ or ‘transcend’ in contexts where the object of transcendence is death itself (GMP 139). An example is the Greek compound noun <em>nek-tar</em> (νέκταρ), consisting of roots meaning ‘death’ (<em>nek</em>- as in <em>nekros</em> ‘corpse’) and ‘conquer’ (-<em>tar</em>, cognate with Hittite <em>tarḫu</em>-). I argue that the Lycian and the Luvian names of the thunder god convey the idea of revivifying as well as overcoming, since thunder gods as described in Indo-European languages have the power to use their thunder weapons not only to overcome violently their enemies but also to preserve and thus make sacred their own devotees—and even to revivify them (GMP 197; see also GMP 132–134).</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.456-16.457","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"tarkhuein ‘ritually prepare’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"hero cult"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"cult hero"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.143064","title":"Iliad 16.460","body":"<p>analysis of philotēs and timē going together with this passage as an example</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.460","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.143115","title":"Iliad 16.464","body":"<p>In the first round of this duel of Patroklos and Sarpedon as chariot fighters, Patroklos is the first to aim his spear at Sarpedon, and then Sarpedon in turn aims at Patroklos, I.16.462–469.

Here I give an epitome of a far more detailed argumentation in Nagy 2012:60–69. In terms of hero cult, the wording that refers here at I.16.456–457 to a funeral and an entombment implies a ritual preparing of the dead body for a mystical revival after death. The word that refers to such immortalization in these Homeric passages is <em>tarkhuein</em> (ταρχύσουσι), at I.07.085, I.16.456, I.16.674. It can be argued that this Greek word <em>tarkhuein</em>, which I translate here neutrally as ‘ritually prepare’, is a borrowing from the Anatolian language that we know as Lycian, and that the corresponding Lycian word conveys the idea of ‘immortalize’. The most relevant forms in the surviving corpus of Anatolian linguistic evidence are (1) Lycian <em>Trqqñt</em>-, name of a Lycian thunder god; (2) the cognate Luvian form <em>Tarḫunt</em>-, name of the thunder god who is head of the Luvian pantheon; (3) the cognate Hittite form <em>tarḫu</em>-/<em>tar(r)uḫ</em>- (/<em>tarx<sup>w</sup></em>-/), a verb meaning ‘be victorious, overcome’. Cognates of this Hittite verb <em>tarḫu</em>- in other Indo-European languages convey the idea of ‘overcome’ or ‘transcend’ in contexts where the object of transcendence is death itself (<em>Greek Mythology and Poetics</em>, 139). An example is the Greek compound noun <em>nek-tar</em> (νέκταρ), consisting of roots meaning ‘death’ (<em>nek</em>- as in <em>nekros</em> ‘corpse’) and ‘conquer’ (-<em>tar</em>, cognate with Hittite <em>tarḫu</em>-). I argue that the Lycian and the Luvian names of the thunder god convey the idea of revivifying as well as overcoming, since thunder gods as described in Indo-European languages have the power to use their thunder weapons not only to overcome violently their enemies but also to preserve and thus make sacred their own devotees—and even to revivify them</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.674-16.675","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"tarkhuein ‘ritually prepare’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144559","title":"Iliad 16.680","body":"<p>We see here further indications of Sarpedon’s impending immortalization: Apollo anoints the hero’s body with <em>ambrosiē </em>‘immortalizing substance’ and clothes him in vestments that are <em>ambrota</em> ‘immortalizing’.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.680","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"ambroto- 'immortalizing'"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144607","title":"Iliad 16.682","body":"<p>The symmetry of personified Sleep and personified Death here is comparable to Homeric attestations of parallel syntax for describing explicitly an awakening after sleep and implicitly a revival after death in scenarios for the immortalization of a cult hero.</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.682","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"Hypnos and Thanatos"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144653","title":"Iliad 16.683","body":"<p>See the comment on I.16.455.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.683","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"dēmos ‘community, district’"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144699","title":"Iliad 16.684-16.687","body":"<p>analysis of the parallelism between Nestor and Patroclus (as in Nestor’s second story), with regards to Patroclus’ failure to turn back from battle as Achilles commands</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.684-16.687","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144746","title":"Iliad 16.685-687","body":"<p>At I.16.685, Patroklos experiences a personal <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’, as expressed by way of the verb <em>aâsthai</em> ‘veer off-course’.  </p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.685-16.687","tags":[{"description":"","image":"","name":"A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad"},{"description":"","image":"","name":"aâsthai ‘veer off-course’ as the verb of atē ‘aberration’"}],"authors":[{"name":"Gregory Nagy","email":"gnagy@chs.harvard.edu","username":"gnagy"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144792","title":"Iliad 16.685","body":"<p>analysis of mēnis in Patroklos’ aristeia</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.685","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144853","title":"Iliad 16.693","body":"<p>analysis of the parallelism between Nestor and Patroclus (as in Nestor’s second story), with regards to Patroclus’ failure to turn back from battle as Achilles commands</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.693","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Douglas Frame","email":"frame@chs.harvard.edu","username":"dframe"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144899","title":"Iliad 16.698-16.704","body":"<p>analysis of mēnis in Patroklos’ aristeia</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.698-16.704","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144945","title":"Iliad 16.705-16.711","body":"<p>analysis of mēnis in Patroklos’ aristeia</p>","target_urn":"urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001:16.705-16.711","tags":[],"authors":[{"name":"Leonard Muellner","email":"muellner@chs.harvard.edu","username":"lmuellner"}]},{"date":"2024-01-18T14:28:18.144995","title":"Iliad 16.705-711","body":"<p>Patroklos confronts Apollo four times and then backs off, thus avoiding the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the god, I.16.711.

In this case, however, the predicated certainty is falsified, since the speaker is Apollo disguised as Hector’s uncle, and the god is of course superior rather than inferior to Hector. Here I epitomize the analysis in GMP 300. Apollo now says, in the guise of Hector’s uncle: if you were that much inferior, then you would retreat in battle, I.16.723. But, since Hector is supposedly that much superior to his uncle, he is of course expected not to retreat. What is hidden in these comparisons is the relative stature of the god himself: the uncle is to Hector as Hector is to Apollo. From the standpoint of Hector, the premise in Apollo’s use of the idiom is reality: the uncle is inferior to Hector. Here I repeat the wording of I.16.722: αἴθ ὅσον ἥσσων εἰμί, τόσον σέο φέρτερος εἴην ‘If only I could be superior to you—as surely as I am that much inferior to you!’ From the standpoint of Apollo and the framing narrative, however, the premise is false: Apollo is superior, not inferior, to Hector.
