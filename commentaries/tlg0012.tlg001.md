# Iliad 1.1

<p>This line features a syntactic formula of the type described by Milman Parry (Parry 1928:17-19 =  Parry 1971:14-16). It consists of the accusative of the noun <em>mênis</em> (μῆνιν, usually translated as &#x27;rage, wrath, anger&#x27;) at the beginning of the line followed by a subjective genitive name (of the person whom the <em>mênis </em>inhabits) with epithets that concludes the line, as in <em>Iliad</em> 1.75, 5.444, 16.711, 19.75 (in the last attestation, the grammatical pattern is the same except that the genitive is not subjective or objective); another multiform of this syntactic pattern occurs in <em>Iliad </em>19.35, where a dative of the <em>object</em> of the anger (Agamemnon) occurs whereas a subjective genitive is found in the other examples. Either epithets for the name or a verb governing the accusative fill up the space between line-initial μῆνιν and the name + epithet combinations at the end of the line; the current line is the only example we have in which an imperative verb and a term of address, θεά, occur in that space, but then again, this is the <em>prooimion</em> of the poem, not the narrative proper. One expects variation in traditional dictional patterns when the context varies, and in this case the variation pertains exactly to the conventional content of this context. One can also say that the traditional diction <em>points at</em> or <em>highlights</em> a conventional narrative usage by placing it in an extra-narrative context.</p><p>Like every word in the epic song-generating system, <em>mênin</em>, the first word of the poem has expressive dimensions that were disclosed to its original audiences and performers through age-old, recurrent exposure to this poetry in performance. Those dimensions are invisible to us — unless we strive to rebuild them from the existing corpus of Homeric poetry. So this word  means potentially more and potentially different things than the English words “rage” or “anger” with which it is usually translated. A contextual analysis that this commentary will track over the course of the poem supports one point that we anticipate here. <em>mēnis </em>is a keyword of a &#x27;theme&#x27; or relatively formalized, larger unit of traditional content (for a working definition of the term ‘theme’ in the study of traditional poetry, see Lord 2000: ch. 4). That theme recurs within a more or less consistent set of episodes and diction elsewhere in the Homeric corpus, so its occurrence evokes a set of narratives that have a discernible pattern or patterns. We will signal the details of the patterns and their recurring diction as they reach the reader’s eyes. However, we signal now that a most illuminating instance of the <em>mênis</em> theme, which would make good reading <em>before</em> reading or re-reading the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, occurs at <em>Iliad</em> 15.1-142.</p><p>References</p><p>Lord, A. 1960, 2nd ed. 2000. <em>The Singer of Tales</em>.

# Iliad 8.220-227

<p>The ships of the Achaeans are beached along the shores of a large U-shaped bay that opens into the Hellespont. See <strong><a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3276.7-conflicting-claims-on-homer">Map 1</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3276.7-conflicting-claims-on-homer">Map 2</a></strong> at HPC 157 and 158 respectively. Such a bay no longer exists, because of long-term silting from the river Scamander, which emptied into the bay. In the second millennium BCE and even later, however, the bay was very much of a reality, as the maps show, and the visualization in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> approximates such a topographical reality. This is not to say, however, that we should imagine the ships of the Achaeans as floating at anchor in the waters of such a bay: rather, the <em>Iliad</em> pictures the ships are beached along the shores of the bay, with their sterns facing inland and their prows facing out toward the waters. On this positioning, see also the comment on I.14.027–036. Exploring further the Iliadic visualization, we can see that the beached ship of Odysseus is located at the bottom of the U-shaped bay, at the south in the middle of the bayline, while the beached ships of Achilles and Ajax are located respectively at the upper left and the upper right tips of the U, at the northwest and northeast. To be highlighted here is a detail about the ship of Odysseus: the king Agamemnon is shown standing on the deck of this beached ship, which is said to be located <em>en messatōi</em> ‘in the middlemost space’, I.08.223, and from here this over-king projects his voice of royal authority, shouting mightily to all the Achaeans stationed at their own ships, I.08.227. Correspondingly, all the Achaeans stationed at all the beached ships can hear the king’s voice—from the ship of Achilles at one extreme of the U-shaped bay all the way to the ship of Ajax at the other extreme, I.08.224–226 (HPC 160–161). Agamemnon’s own beached ship, together with the ships of Diomedes and Nestor, is located near the ship of Odysseus, and it is in this ‘middlemost space’ of the U-shaped bayline that the central station of the Achaeans is visualized by the narrative, I.08.223. In the later comments at I.11.005–016, I.11.806–808, and I.14.027–036, there will be more to say about the locations of all these beached ships. To be highlighted already now, however, is the general reference to the <em>klisiai</em> or ‘shelters’ here at I.08.220, which are the abodes of the heroes. Then at I.08.224 the same word <em>klisiai</em> refers specifically to the abodes of Achilles and Ajax, mentioned at I.08.224–225. The description here shows that the <em>klisiai</em> ‘shelters’ of these two heroes are pointedly aligned with their beached ships. As for the ships beached at the middle of the bayline in the south, they mark a political and sacral centerpoint for the Achaeans. The evidence for the preceding formulation will be presented in the comment on I.11.806–808. </p>

# Iliad 9.270-272/ anchor comment on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 2

<p>The story that is being told here at I.09.128–131 and retold at I.09.270–272 centers on one single stunning event: Achilles captured the entire island of Lesbos. By implication, this island became Aeolian precisely because it was captured by the principal hero of the Aeolians. The vastness of this story is even broader in scope, since we can see in the <em>Iliad</em> occasional references to other such conquests accomplished by Achilles. Most prominent are the Iliadic references to his capturing of two cities located on the Aeolian mainland of Asia Minor: they are Lyrnessos and Thēbē. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and his capturing of Briseis are mentioned for the first time at I.02.690–691. What then follows at I.02.691 is a mention of his conquering the walled city of Thēbē as well. Thēbē is mentioned already at I.01.366: it was there that Achilles captured another woman, Chryseis, when he conquered that city, I.01.366–369. For background on Briseis and on Chryseis, I again strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography. Another native of Thēbē was Andromache, who had been married off to Hector at Troy before the beginning of the Trojan War: she was taken captive only later, after Troy was captured, and she was then allotted as a war-prize to the son of Achilles, Neoptolemos: the story was told in an epic that was part of the epic Cycle and was known as the <em>Iliou Persis</em> ‘Destruction of Ilion’, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, plot summary by Proclus p. 108 line 9 (ed. Allen 1912). That said, I now elaborate further on the argument initiated in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694: the conquests of these territories by Achilles, especially his capture of Lesbos, can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologizes a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” of east Aeolis, as it were, by west Aeolian migrants from Thessaly, situated in the European mainland, which was the reputed birthplace of Achilles. See Nagy 2011b:171–173. In using the term “east Aeolis” here, I am referring to the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos, together with the facing mainland of northern Asia Minor. The “colonization” of this area has conventionally been described as the “Aeolian Migration,” and the term ‘migration’ here matches neatly the appropriate Greek word, <em>apoikiā</em> as used in Strabo 9.2.3 C401 and elsewhere (see Nagy 2011b:161). The reference at I.09.129 to the captive women from Lesbos can be correlated with the poetic traditions of Lesbos as later attested in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus, both dated around 600 BCE. These poetic traditions, which are decidedly Aeolian, derive not only from the island of Lesbos but also from the island of Tenedos and from the mainland of northern Asia Minor facing these two islands. See HPC 184–185. Traces of these Aeolian poetic traditions can be seen in the Iliadic references to such figures as Briseis, Chryseis, Andromache, and the seven unnamed captive women from Lesbos. All these figures derive from Aeolian poetic traditions, and the same can be said about the figure of Achilles himself: in terms of his poetic heritage, he is Achilles the Aeolian. See Nagy 2011b:171–172. But there is an important difference to be highlighted here: Achilles is an Aeolian from European Thessaly, while the captive women are Aeolians from Asia Minor and from the offshore islands of Lesbos and Tenedos (on the captive woman Hekamede from Tenedos, see the anchor comment at I.11.624–627). In the Ionian poetic traditions of epic as exemplified by Homeric poetry, we can track the early influence of corresponding Aeolian poetic traditions as exemplified at a later period, around 600 BCE, by the songmaking of Sappho and Alcaeus. See also anchor comment at I.02.689–694 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 1 and anchor comment at I.11.624–627 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 3.</p>

# Iliad 1.11

<p>The language (<em>ētīmēsen arētēra</em>) here specifies that Agamemnon slighted the <em>tīmē</em> of Chryses in his role as <em>arētēr</em> &#x27;one who prays/curses&#x27;. </p><p>The notion of slighted <em>tīmē</em> evokes the system of reciprocal exchange between individuals and groups that is the basis of the social system in the epic for mortals and immortals. How this system works and the significance of offenses to it will be tracked in this commentary as part of the treatment of the <em>mēnis</em> theme in the poem, to which they are vitally related. As G. Nagy has shown in <em>Best of the Achaeans,</em> in Epic there is both a divine and a human sense of the word <em>tïmē</em>: in the divine world, <em>tīmē</em> means the &#x27;sphere&#x27; in which a divinity operates. For example one part of the sphere of Apollo is both the causing and the healing of <em>loimos</em> &#x27;plague&#x27;. By contrast, in the warrior domain, <em>tīmē</em> means an individual&#x27;s social prestige within the group. This differentiation in meaning is because of the division of labor that obtains among the divinities and of the <em>absence</em> of the division of labor among the heroes — or, to put it another way, to the fact that all members of the warrior class in theory at least compete for excellence in the same set of spheres, which are the ones that are divided up into specializations among the gods. So the same term,  <em>timē</em>, can mean general prestige for humans and specific prerogatives for gods. The gods do not conflict with one another except when the boundaries between their <em>prerogatives</em> are not respected, whereas the heroes conflict with each when their <em>prestige</em> as warriors is not respected.</p><p>On the other hand, the old man Chryses, unlike the warriors, is a human being <em>with a sphere or prerogative</em> that is specified along with the fact that he has been slighted. In other words, what Agamemnon has done is to slight his prerogative as a person who prays/curses, not his general prestige in the specialized domain of warriors. </p>

# Iliad 1.013

<p>The traditional epithet used here for the <em>apoina</em> 'payment of goods offered in exchange for someone' is the word <em>apereisi'</em> 'limitless', an adjective that occurs eleven times in Homeric epic at exactly this point in the line to qualify the neuter plural noun <em>apoina</em>. It also occurs twice, again in the same place in the line, in the form <em>apereisia</em> (without the last syllable elided) as the epithet of the noun <em>eedna</em> 'wedding gift' (Iliad 16.178, Odyssey 19.529; also Hesiod Frag. 198.10 [M-W], with the same line-placement as all other attestations). Like the word <em>apoina</em>, eedna also designates goods given as part of a transaction, but the transaction in question is always and only a wedding, and the goods go with a woman. The fact that <em>apereisia </em>'limitless' is an otherwise unattested traditional epithet shared only between these two kinds of exchange means that there are analogies between them. The difference between the two is that in a wedding, the gift-goods go <em>with</em> the woman, the third person whose ownership is being transferred from her father's household to her husband's father's household, whereas in a 'payment' like the one being proposed to Agamemnon here, the goods are <em>in exchange for</em> the third person, male or female, whose ownership is being transferred between two others — in this particular case, from Agamemnon to her father. In effect, what Chryses is proposing to Agamemnon and Menelaus and all the Achaeans is the reverse of a wedding gift: the father seeks to <em>retrieve</em> his daughter from a kind of spouse (in rejecting the offer, Agamemnon soon says that he actually prefers her to his own wife, Iliad 1.111-115)  by the offer of gift-goods in exchange for her. </p><p>Now we can understand why the goods offered in payment in both cases are qualified as 'without end/limit'. Such exchanges resemble an extreme form of exchange analyzed in detail by Marcel Mauss (see the note on Iliad 1.13-15) called <em>potlatch.</em> Among the Amerindians of the Pacific Northwest, positively ruinous amounts of prestige goods are offered in exchanges between groups, and the exchanges even include the flagrant casting of precious valuables into the sea, the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. The idea behind <em>potlatch</em> and the epithet <em>apereisia</em> for a payment in this instance or in the case of a wedding seem to me the same: in theory at least, they are offers of exchange that cannot be refused, and they are designed to display the ultimate wealth, prestige, and power of the party that offers them, though like other gifts they appear on the surface to be generous. Their extreme nature is also designed to be absolute in its effectiveness: the 'limitless' wedding gift cements the marriage because the husband's father's household will never give up such wealth (if the bride leaves the marriage, the wealth goes with her!), and Chryses' 'limitless' payment perfects the <em>disjunction</em> between the two parties because the wealth offered in exchange for the woman is beyond adequate as compensation for her. The key is, as Mauss showed, that gifts are both obligatory and they generate obligations in those who receive them, and the bigger the gifts the more stringent the obligations. </p>

# Iliad 1.25

<p>This line marks the first appearance of the word <em>mûthos</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>. Here Agamemnon addresses Chryses; he κρατερὸν δ᾽ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε. Often this word is translated simply as <em>word</em> or <em>speech</em>. However, it is apparent in this line that <em>mûthos</em> is not just a speech but also an act that displays authority. On the one hand, <em>mûthos</em> is a performance of Agamemnon’s power over Chryses. On the other, it is a performance before the troops intended to persuade the audience that his action is appropriate. In general, the word <em>mûthos</em> is best understood as a speech-act which is performed in order to augment, diminish, or negotiate the status and power of speakers in the <em>Iliad</em>. In the <em>Iliad</em> all<em> muthoi</em> are performed at length, usually in public, and comprise a range of speech-genres. However, all but 12 of the 167 occurrences of the stem <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>muth</em></span>- (noun and verb forms) in the <em>Iliad</em> can also be categorized as marking proposals and commands or threats and boasts. These discourses can be further categorized into three genres:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commands (See Zeus’s command via Iris at <em>Iliad</em> 8.399-408)</li>
<li>Boast-and-insult contests (see Agamemnon’s <em>epipolesis </em>in <em>Iliad</em> 4)</li>
<li>The recitation of remembered events (see Nestor at <em>Iliad</em> 1.259-274)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus each hero in the <em>Iliad</em> is a performer who utilizes these genres in order to compete within Homeric society. <em>mûthos</em> then is an authoritative self-presentation of the speaker to the audience which can be directly contrasted with the Homeric word <em>epos</em>: a short utterance that accompanies but does not constitute performance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Homeric poetry itself can be understood as <em>mûthos</em>. It is “poetry meant to persuade, enacted in public, created by authority, in a context where authority is always up for grabs and to be won by the speaker with the best style” (Martin 1993:238).</p>

# Iliad 1.43

<p>This line is a multiform of the regular formula for concluding prayers that are labelled with the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, which is a word that designates three different kinds of discourse by using mutually exclusive formulas for each of the three. It has a two-part structure extending  from the line-beginning to the oblgatory word-break within the third foot and from the obligatory word-break to the end of the line. The first chunk, <em>hōs ephat'/ephan eukhomenos/ē/oi/ai</em>, whose subject is always a previously identified mortal or mortals, designates that the discourse that precedes the line was a prayer and is concluded, and the second chunk, <em>tou d' eklue</em> |¯˘˘ | ¯˘#, designates that the divinity addressed, whose name + epithet combination is specified in the space at the end of the line, 'heard' (<em>eklue</em>, cognate with the English word '(k)listen') the prayer (for Poseidon, just the epithet <em>kuanokhaitēs 'with a glossy blue mane' occurs</em>, since his name + epithet combinations are too long to fit the metrical space) . 'Heard' is functionally unmarked in English, but in only one of the 25 occurrences of this formulaic line does it mean anything less than accepted and agreed: at <em>Iliad</em> 16.250, where Zeus accepts one part of Achilles' request about Patroklos and refuses (the verb is <em>aneneue</em> 'was refusing') the other. When the response to the prayer is (exceptionally) negative, the expression <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> 'and he/she heard him/her' is replaced with <em>aneneue de + </em>name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 6.311) 'and she was refusing'  or <em>nemesēse de</em> + name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 8.198) 'and she was outraged'. There are also two places where <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> is replaced with different verbs and divine names to express an exceptionally <em>positive</em> response on the part of the divinity (<em>Odyssey</em> 2.267 and <em>Iliad</em> 15.377). There are also two attestations when the beginning of this line, <em>hōs ephat' eukhomenos, </em>is attested in a non-sacral context that evokes one of the other meanings of the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, 'boast (of warriors in battle)'; see <em>Iliad</em> 5.106 and <em>Iliad</em> 20.393, but in both those cases (and in no others) good medieval manuscripts attest a metrically equivalent variant <i>hōs phat' <strong>ep</strong>eukhomenos </i>which is actually attested in the meaning 'boast' without variants in <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 370; so it is clear that just the first half of this formulaic line is, despite a plausible ambiguity, traditionally associated with the meaning 'pray' in sacral contexts.</p><p>In short, this line is a manifestation of a superbly efficient and expressive system for concluding a prayer. </p>

# Iliad 2.761/ anchor comment on: the singular Muse of the Iliad and Odyssey

<p>Unlike what we see at I.02.484, Ι.11.218, I.14.508, I.16.112, where the Muses are invoked as plural goddesses, the Muse here at I.02.761 is invoked as a singular goddess. And the Muse is of course singular also at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, I.01.001, and at the beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, O.01.001. There are also two other cases where a singular Muse is invoked:</p><p>A) In the First Song of Demodokos, O.08.73–82, which is featured as a proto-Iliad(see the comment at O.08.073-082), a singular Muse inspires the singer of tales at the beginning of his performance, at O.08.073. I think that the self-awareness at I.02.761 in invoking a singular Muse has to do with the singularity of the subject at I.02.760–770, since the subject in this case is Achilles. The Muse is asked for an answer to the Iliadic question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The answer of the Muse is that Achilles is the best. He is the singularity of the <em>Iliad </em>as epic, just as Odysseus is the singularity of the <em>Odyssey</em> as epic. That is why, I propose, the singular Muse here is the goddess Calliope. She is the perfect singularity of a Muse for these notionally singular heroes of two singularly important epics. After all, Calliope is the Muse of Epic. I refer here to my relevant arguments in <em><a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4377">Homer the Preclassic</a></em> E[pilegomena] §109 (p. 345) about Calliope as the Muse of kings (Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 79–93). Similarly, as I argue there, Orpheus was once the singular poet of kings, but his status was degraded in the Athenian phase of Homeric reception.</p><p>B) In the Third Song of Demodokos, O.08.499–533, when the singer of tales marks the beginning of his performance at O.08.499, the anonymous ‘divinity’ that he invokes at that point is a <em>theos</em>, in the singular. Short-term, this <em>theos</em> ‘divinity’ can be understood to be either Apollo or ‘the Muse’, as the disguised Odysseus himself remarks at O.08.488. Long-term, however, Apollo and the Muses are surrogates here for Zeus himself, who at O.13.025 is finally identified as the transcendent source of inspiration for the singing of Demodokos. The figuring of Zeus as such a transcendent source was traditionally considered to be a signature, as it were, of ‘Homer’ himself, as we read in the reference at Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3 to the <em>Homēridai</em>, a guild of singers from Chios who claimed, as ‘descendants of Homer’, to be the legitimate transmitters of ‘Homer’ as their poetic ancestor. An example of such a reference is the wording at the very beginning of Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3: ὅθεν περ καὶ Ὁμηρίδαι | ῥαπτῶν ἐπέων τὰ πόλλ᾿ ἀοιδοί | ἄρχονται, Διὸς ἐκ προοιμίου ‘(starting) from the point where [<em>hothen</em>] the <em>Homēridai</em>, singers, most of the time [<em>ta polla</em>] begin [<em>arkhesthai</em>] their stitched-together words, from the prelude [<em>prooimion</em>] of Zeus …’.</p>

# Iliad 1.1-1.12

<p>The main theme of the narration is signaled right away. The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. The word is <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, I.01.001, and it refers to the anger of Achilles. A definitive book on this word is Muellner 1996. The Master Narrator begins his narration by focusing on this anger: he calls on a Muse, whom he addresses simply as <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’, to sing this anger, I.01.001. The subject of this narration, the anger of Achilles, is the grammatical object of the verb aeidein ‘sing’. So, the <em>narrative subject</em> is the <em>grammatical object</em>. The Master Narrator is calling on the Muse to sing the anger, not just sing about the anger. The song is not only about the anger: it is the anger itself. The song captures the total reality of the anger. The Master Narrator proceeds to tell about this anger: it happened because of a quarrel, as signaled especially by the words <em>erizein</em> ‘have strife’ at I.01.006 and <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at I.01.008. This quarrel in the <em>Iliad</em> is parallel to another quarrel that is narrated in a “micro-Iliad” that we find embedded in the <em>Odyssey</em>. This micro-Iliad is the First Song of Demodokos, O<em>.</em>08.072–083, and the quarrel there is signaled especially by the word <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075. It has been debated whether the quarrel scene in this “micro-Iliad” was modeled on a quarrel-scene in the <em>Cypria</em>, which was part of the epic Cycle. On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. But the quarrel scenes of the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Cypria</em>, and the “micro-Iliad” can be seen as stemming from epic traditions that were originally independent of each other. On the term <em>epic</em>, used here for the first time in these comments on the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, see again the Inventory of terms and names.  </p>

<p>The <em>mēnis</em> of Achilles is a special kind of ‘anger’. The hero feels this anger after his <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ is damaged by the over-king Agamemnon. The Master Narrator says at verse 2 here that this special anger caused <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ for the Achaeans. The word <em>mēnis</em> does not yet refer to the anger of other persons in the narration. As the narration continues, however, it becomes clear that the god Apollo felt <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ at the Achaeans even before the hero Achilles felt his own <em>mēnis</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 1.3-1.5

<p>In the <em>Iliad</em>, the word <em>autos</em> ‘self’ refers to the body as the basis of identity for heroes, while the word <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ refers to (A) the <em>life-force</em> of heroes when they are alive and (B) the <em>disembodied conveyor of identity</em> when they are dead. Here at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, the dead body of the generic hero is identified with the ‘self’, <em>autos</em>. When a warrior dies in the <em>Iliad</em>, his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ goes to the realm of Hādēs while his body, which is his ‘self’, is left behind and must be treated with proper ritual care. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the ritually correct treatment of a warrior’s dead body, which is called <em>sōma</em>, is cremation. See I.22.342–343 and the comment on I.22.335–354. The very idea of exposing a dead body to be devoured by dogs and birds is considered to be an abomination in the <em>Iliad</em>, as in the verses here at I.01.3–5, by contrast with the ritually correct practice of cremation. See the comment on I.22.335–354. There is also a cross-cultural contrast to be noted here: the practice of exposing a dead body to be eaten by dogs and birds is considered to be ritually correct in Iranian traditions that uphold Zoroastrian orthodoxy, while the very idea of cremating a dead body is for Zoroastrians an abomination. Both practices, exposition and cremation, are linked with ideas of eschatology, that is, of a permanent kind of afterlife. In Zoroastrian traditions, such an afterlife is endangered by cremation, while in Homeric traditions the danger comes from exposition. There will be more to say about ideas of afterlife in the anchor comment at I.23.071–076, where it will be argued that Hādēs in Homeric poetry is merely a transitional phase of afterlife for the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of a hero who died: in other words, Hādēs is not eschatological. </p>

# Iliad 1.24

<p>In rejecting the offer of Chryses, Agamemnon ignores the norms of exchange behavior made concrete by the expression of the common opinion of everyone else in favor of what pleases his own heart's desire (literally, 'to Agamemnon, to his heart'). David Elmer (2013, p. 42-46) has shown that the verb 'to please' that is used here, <em>handanein</em>, is "an essential component of the <em>Iliad</em>'s decision-making vocabulary" (p. 44), in which it functions as "a way of signaling divergence from an otherwise cohesive collective will (p. 42)." He also argues that an authoritarian, individualistic preference overriding the collective will is <em>not</em> normative behavior in Homeric society, but its opposite. The norm in decision-making in the <em>Iliad</em> is for the collective will to be decisive (Elmer 2013, Chapter 1). Furthermore, Agamemnon's divergent response represents a failure to perceive the interwoven social and sacral consequences of his act. Agamemnon himself is not only the titular leader of the whole expedition to Troy on his brother's behalf, manifested in his possession of the epithet <em>anax andrōn </em>'lord of men' (an expression that is used of him 49 of the 54 times it occurs in the Homeric and Hesiodic poems), but he is also the wielder of the sacrificial knife (Hitch 2009, Chapter 4), to which we can compare the role of Chryses as the old man who prays/curses and who bears wreaths on a golden <em>skēptron</em> 'staff/sceptre' (1.14-15): we have discussed above the overt sacred/social aspects of the system of exchange: see the comments on <em>Iliad</em> 1.13-15.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Hitch, Sarah. 2009. <em>King of Sacrifice: Ritual and Royal Authority in the</em> Iliad.

<p>The Will of Zeus is presented here as the plot of the narration or narrative arc that we know as the <em>Iliad</em>. The Greek noun <em>boulē</em>, translated here as ‘Will’, is what the god ‘wishes’, as expressed by the verb <em>boulesthai</em> ‘wish’. For <em>boulesthai</em> ‘wish’, see the comment on I.11.078–079. But the noun <em>boulē</em> conveys also the idea of ‘planning’, not just ‘wishing’: when Zeus wishes to do something, he engages in planning what he wishes, so that the Will of Zeus is also the Plan of Zeus. See the comment on I.01.524–530 concerning the Plan of Zeus. In comments still to come, there will be further observations on the Will of Zeus with reference to other relevant words, including <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’, <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, <em>mūthos</em> ‘wording’.</p>

<p>The Master Narrator calls on the Muse to explain the cause of the <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. (See also the pointed use of the word <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at Pindar <em>Paean</em> 6.50–53.) It is now revealed that the god Apollo has a basic role in the plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, and that he too was angry at Agamemnon, even before Achilles became angry at this over-king. It is now also revealed that Apollo himself has agency in the outcome of the epic that we know as the <em>Iliad</em>. In the version of the epic as we have it, however, such an agency of Apollo is subsumed under the ultimate divine agency represented by the Will of Zeus. In earlier versions of the <em>Iliad</em>, on the other hand, the events of the epic could actually be attributed to the agency of Apollo. More on this subject in HPC 111–115.  </p>

# Iliad 1.13-15

<p>Chrysēs came to the ships to engage in an exchange, a behavior that the anthropologist/sociologist Marcel Mauss described as the basic form of social contract in archaic societies. Archaic exchange systems, he said, are "total social phenomena", in that they seamlessly interweave <em>economic</em>, <em>sacral</em>, and <em>social </em>or<em> group</em> interaction. That is exactly what we see here: the intention to exchange involves Chrysēs with the whole social group (l. 15, πάντας Ἀχαιούς, 'all Achaeans'), it requires of him the transfer of wealth —the verb φέρω 'carry, bear' (l. 13) designates the movement of prestige goods that cannot move by themselves—, and it is accompanied by the display of sacred symbols referred to the god Apollo, namely wreaths on a golden scepter (lines 14-15). </p><p>This attempt at exchange may look to us like the kind of economic transaction that only occurs between civilized people and criminals. It is customary to translate the word λυσόμενος in line 13 with the English word 'ransom', because for us, the exchange of human beings for goods is 'human trafficking,' which is by definition a heinous evil. Mauss also clarifies this problem, which is one of the most difficult aspects of an archaic exchange system for us to understand. In the world of Homeric epic, Mauss would say, humans are exchangeable for goods not because humans are commodified or objectified, but because <em>goods are humanized</em>, because they are as dear and as attached to human beings as human beings are to each other. Lacking a medium of exchange like coins or bills, which can dehumanize even prestige goods made by artists or skilled craftsmen, people in the Epic world not only identify themselves with what we call objects (as we sometimes do), they also do not categorically distinguish between people and things as property types. Instead, the regnant distinction is between immovable goods (those which cannot move themselves), like tripods or golden cups or woven goods, and movable ones (those which can move themselves), like cattle or human beings or slaves.</p><p>References</p><p>Mauss, Marcel. "Essai sur le don: forme et raison de l'change dans les sociétés archaïques, <em>L'Année sociologique</em>, nouvelle série, I, 1923-1924 (<a href="http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/mauss_marcel/socio_et_anthropo/2_essai_sur_le_don/essai_sur_le_don.pdf">http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/mauss_marcel/socio_et_anthropo/2_essai_sur_le_don/essai_sur_le_don.pdf</a>) translated into English by W.

# Iliad 1.20

<p>The noun <em>apoina</em> 'payment' occurs as the object of the verb <em>dekhesthai</em> 'receive, accept' in various forms six times in the Iliad (Iliad 1.20, 1.23, 1.111, 1.377, 6.46, 11.131) and once in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (l. 140); the same is true of the noun <em>poinē</em> 'payment, blood money' (Iliad 9.633, 9.636, 17.207-208), which is derived from the same root as <i>apoina. </i> Another verb is used once to denote <em>not</em> 'accepting' a <em>poinē</em> in the legal dispute described on Achilles' shield  at Iliad 18.501, namely <em>helesthai</em> 'take for oneself'. There is a demonstrably living analogy between <em>poinē</em> and <i>apoina</i>, as one can see from the context of Iliad 9.632-637, which draws an explicit parallel between the two, so the use of a different verb, <em>helesthai, </em>in the instance of a negated <em>poinē,</em> reinforces the normality of the syntactic formula is <em>apoina</em> + forms of <em>dekhesthai</em> 'to accept'. </p><p>Payments designated as <em>apoina</em> in Homeric epic are customarily accepted. We can say that the traditional diction is equipped for that, and in archaic exchange systems as described by Mauss, there are symmetrical obligations: there is an obligation to accept an offer to exchange just as there is an obligation to reciprocate appropriately once one accepts an exchange. There are exceptions to those obligations, but they are fraught with danger and power for all concerned. One such exception is this one, the first scene in the Iliad, in which Agamemnon rejects the <em>apoina</em> of Chryses. For another example, we can point to Achilles fighting in the river Xanthos at the beginning of Iliad 21, when he comes upon the Trojan Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had not long before captured and 'sold' — the difference between 'selling' and giving <em>apoina</em> for a person is not to be pressed (see <em>peperēmenos </em>'having been sold' 21.58, 21.78 vs. 21.99 <em>apoina </em>for the same transaction as well as the extremely archaic expression <em>ōnon edōke</em> 'paid a price' at 21.41 for another transaction of the same type). Lycaon grabs Achilles by the knees in the posture of a suppliant, in other words, a person urgently requesting a customarily obligatory "favor". Yet Achilles tells him that his (Achilles') days of accepting payment for captives, which he did often before (21.100-102), have ended with the death of Patroklos, especially, he says, when it comes to the sons of Priam. Then, by way of consolation for both himself and Lycaon, Achilles goes on to describe the coming day of his own death, at dawn or midday or in the afternoon, by a spear or an arrow from a bowstring (21.106-113). Then he kills Lycaon, brutally, confronting us, too, with the moment of death for a person who has just come to life for us in the narrative. For a third example, there is Achilles' refusal of Agamemnon's <em>apoina</em> for him in Iliad 9, but as we shall see, there are significant anomalies in that failed transaction that are not present in this instance or in Achilles' refusal of Lycaon. A better parallel to the present moment is the legal dispute on Achilles' shield, which turns on the question, in what circumstances the refusal of a <em>poinē</em> could be proper — with the implication that there may or may not be such circumstances.</p>

# Iliad 1.22-1.23

<p>The language precisely contrasts the response of 'all the other Achaeans' (<em>alloi...pantes...Akhaioi</em>, l. 22) with that of Agamemnon, 'but not to Agamemnon son of Atreus' (<em>all' ouk Atreidēi Agamemnon, </em>l. 24) to the offer of a 'limitless ransom' by the old man, Chryses. That Agamemnon's response paces him in a minority of one is another sign that the offer of payment is obligatory by custom and that its refusal is dangerous and powerful when viewed in the context of other offers of <em>apoina</em> 'payment' and their refusal/acceptance (see notes above on <em>Iliad</em> 1.13, 1.13-15, and 1.20; for a parallel to Agamemnon's isolated position here, see Odyssey 3.141-143). D. Elmer (2103, pp. 30-31 and chapter 3, pp. 63-85) argues that the diction describing the collective response of  all the Achaeans (<em>alloi...pantes epeuphēmēsan Akhaioi</em> 'all the other Achaeans shouted their approval', l. 22) is also exceptional, not the standard way of expressing communal opinion, as is the utter refusal of Agamemnon to hear and heed their response in rejecting the offer. Note also the semantic parallelism between the earlier expression 'he slighted the prestige of the one who prays/curses' (of Chryses, l. 11, previewing Agamemnon's reaction here), and the Achaeans request that he, by contrast, 'show the priest respect'  (<em>aideisthai hierēa</em>, l. 23). <em>Aidōs</em> (seen here in its denominative verb <em>aideisthai</em>) is another key term in the vocabulary of social value, where a person's <em>aidōs</em> 'respect' is a function of a figure's <em>timē</em> 'prestige, prerogative'. That is why he is again described in his social function as priest, just as he was described as 'the one who prays/curses' in the earlier formulation. In line 23, note again the parallelism and implied equivalence between engaging in exchange (<em>aglaa dekhthai apoina</em> 'to accept the splendid payment') and showing respect for the priest (<em>aideisthai </em><i>hierea</i>), because a person's value to the society is manifest in the way in which he or she participates in exchange.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Elmer, David. <em>The Poetics of Consent: Collective Decision Making in the</em> Iliad.

# Iliad 1.37-1.43

<p>Homeric prayers, of which this is a relatively standard example, are predicated upon the system of gift exchange that also prevails in human social interaction. Their form and content is a function of that and of the way in which oral traditional poetry composes <em>themes</em>, which are chunks of conventional discourse that exemplify fixed and variable dictional and semantic elements that vary depending upon the particular context of each instance. What we see in this particular prayer are three structural elements that are generalizable but also variable both as to their content and in their presence or absence: 1) an address to a particular divinity; 2) a statement that either <em>generates</em> a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity by speech-acting the giving of an obligatory gift now or in the future, or a statement that <em>points to</em> the past existence of a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity on the basis of previous successful interactions based on exchanges; 3) a request on the part of the speaking human that the divinity accomplish something on the human's behalf as a function of the divinity's present, past, or future obligation to do so because of the exchange relationship that is being generated, will be generated, or has existed in the past.</p><p>So here, Chrysēs first 1) names the divinity in local terms (1.37-39) for the god Apollo — he is not so named but has been identified by his Olympian name in the narrative preceding the prayer as its addressee (1.35); 2) states that in the past, he has put the roof on temples (in other words, completed their construction) and burnt thigh pieces, the choicest part of the sacrificial animals, bulls and goats, as gifts to the divinity that serve as the basis of the request that is coming next; and 3) requests that the divinity fulfill his wish, namely, "may the Danaans <em>pay for</em> my tears with your weapons," an example of negative reciprocity in which bad is returned for bad, just as the overall prayer itself is based on the exchange of good for good.</p>

# Iliad 1.50-1.53

<p>The noun <em>kēla</em> that occurs in line is attested in Homeric and Hesiodic poetry by these three formulae at line initial position, line final position, and after the word break in the third foot:</p><p>#κῆλα Διός '<em>kēla</em> of Zeus' Hesiod, <em>Theogony</em> 708 and Fragment 204.138 </p><p>κῆλα θεοῖο# '<em>kēla</em> of a/the god' <em>Iliad</em> 1.53=1.383</p><p>||πιφαυκόμενς τὰ ἂ κῆλα 'showing those <em>kēla</em> of his' Hymn to Apollo 444, <em>Iliad</em> 12.280</p><p>The formulas designate the weapons of Zeus in three places (<em>Iliad</em> 12.280 and the two Hesiodic passages) and the arrows of Apollo in three places (<em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 444 as well as here and in the repetition of this passage at <em>Iliad</em> 1.383). In the case of Zeus' <em>kēla</em>, it is evident that the reference is to his fiery thunderbolts. What is not immediately apparent is that Apollo's <em>kēla</em> are in fact also fire-bearing. Here is the line from the Homeric Hymn:</p><p>ἔνθ' ἄρ' ὅ γε φλόγα δαῖε πιφαυσκόμενος τὰ ἃ κῆλα</p><p>'there he was making fire blaze, revealing those <em>kēla</em> of his...</p><p>And in this passage, in the line that just precedes the occurrence of the formula shared by Zeus and Apollo, <em>kēla</em> <em>theoio</em> 'the god's <em>kēla</em>', we read of the fire of pyres as the immediate consequence of Apollo's arrow-shooting in the line immediately before the current one: </p><p>Iliad 1.52 βαλλ'· αἰεὶ δὶ πυραὶ νεκύων καίοντο θαμεῖαι </p><p>'he was hitting them; and immediately the pyres of corpses were burning thick and fast'</p><p>It is as though the <em>kēla</em> cause the pyres to burn. In seeking the etymology of this term, an underlying assumption has been, I believe, that what Zeus and Apollo share are arrows or things like them (thunderbolts), and so the etymology of <em>kēla</em> has been sought, unsuccessfully, in words in other Indo-European languages for arrows or 'shafts'. But every occurrence of the word in Epic diction evokes <em>fire</em> as an aspect of the <em>kēla</em>. What is happening on a thematic level is also relevant, because Apollo is here exercising <em>mēnis</em> 'cosmic anger' (see <em>Iliad</em> 1.75) by way of cosmic arrows — in fact he is functioning as a variant of Zeus, since striking victims with the thunderbolt is the conventional manifestation of Zeus' <em>mēnis. </em>And we will see that fire and in fact cosmic fire that goes up to the sky can become an expression of Achilles' <em>mēnis </em>as well (on this topic, see also now G. Nagy, "Cataclysm and Ecpyrosis, two symmetrical actions of Zeus as sky-god," <em>Classical Inquiries</em>, May 19, 2016, http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/cataclysm-and-ecpyrosis-two-symmetrical-actions-of-zeus-as-sky-god/). On this level, one might prefer to define this word as 'fiery shafts' rather than just 'shafts'. It is not surprising that a connection was made in the Hesiodic scholia and in a late Byzantine Homeric gloss of this line which perhaps reflects earlier exegetical traditions: </p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">Scholion on <em>Theogony</em> 708: &lt;κῆλα Διός:&gt; τὰ καυστικὰ σημεῖα "Zeus's <em>kēla</em>: burning signs/omens";</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;">13th Century Byzantine on Iliad 1.51: ...ᾤχετο κῆλα θεοῖο. παρὰ τὸν <strong>κήσω</strong> μέλλοντα τὸν δηλοῦντα τὸ <strong>καύσω</strong>. ὅθεν καὶ τό· πυρὶ κηλέῳ, τουτέστι καυστικῷ,  "<em>kēla</em> of the god:  [derived] from the future [form] κήσω, which shows the [verbal form] καύσω.

Crusius 1808, rear. 1967, alphabetic letter kappa, p. 1206, line 3</p><p>It is reasonable to believe that the poetic tradition also sensed the relationship between κῆλα and the verb καίω, whether by way of folk etymology or, perhaps, by way of an inherited etymological relationship.</p><p>The adjective κηλέῳ 'blazing' is attested only in the formula πυρὶ κηλέῳ 'blazing fire', in synizesis, six times in line final position, once after the triphthemimeral caesura, and once in the form πυρὶ κηλείῳ before the penthehemimeral caesura.  The form cited just above from the  as the future of the verb καίω, namely κήσω, is not otherwise attested and may be a mistake, but the form ἔκηα (Iliad 1.40 etc.), which is an archaic athematic aorist with the 1st person singular ending <em>-ṃ</em> that was later misunderstood as a first aorist ending -α, attests to the verbal root for 'burn' with that vocalism (κη-). That form should be reconstructed as *ἔκηϝα, to which we can compare the Thessalian εκηυα attested in a ?? inscription. </p>

# Iliad 1.074-083

<p>The words spoken by Kalkhas the seer here at I.01.074–083 indicate three different kinds of anger: <em>mēnis</em> at I.01.075, <em>kholos</em> at I.01.081, and <em>kotos</em> at I.01.082. In the case of <em>mēnis</em>, it is a kind of “cosmic sanction”: I cite the definitive work of Muellner 1996, especially ch.1. As for <em>kholos</em>, it is a kind of explosive anger that is generally instantaneous, as opposed to <em>kotos</em>, which is an anger that is timed to go off only in the fullness of time, when the course of events in the narration has come to fulfillment, as expressed here at I.01.082 by way of the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘come to fulfillment’. On <em>kotos</em> in particular and on <em>kholos</em> in general, see Walsh 2013, especially ch. 1, where he analyzes the wording of the seer here at I.01.074–083 as a kind of “folk definition” for all three of the different kinds of anger mentioned in this passage. </p>

# Iliad 1.6-7

<p>Short version: The verb ἐτελείετο &#x27;[the plan/will of Zeus] was beginning to be fulfilled&#x27; in line 6 is followed by the expression ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;just from the time when [they stood apart to fight]&#x27; in line 7, so it appears as though Διὸς βουλή &#x27;the plan/will of Zeus&#x27; began when Agamemnon and Achilles &#x27;stood apart&#x27; to fight. That is a legitimate interpretation based on the conventions of epic syntax and of a parallel <em>prooimion</em> in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82 (which coordinates the πήματος ἀρχή &#x27;beginning of suffering&#x27; with the &#x27;plans/wishes of Zeus&#x27;) , but it is also a convention of epic <em>prooimia</em> to specify the starting point of the poem, so it is reasonable to think that the audience could at the same time sense that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from the time when&#x27; also goes back to the verb ἄειδε &#x27;sing!&#x27; in line 1, specifying the starting point of the song as the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, which line 8 then confirms.</p><p>Longer version: The verb ἐτελείετο &#x27;was beginning to be fulfilled&#x27; in line 6 is the verb of the third and last paratactic clause after the relative clause ἥ...  in line 2 of the standard <em>prooimion</em> to the <em>Iliad</em>.  The first two finite verbs of the <em>prooimion</em> are aorists (ἔθηκε, προΐαψε) whereas ἐτελείετο and the verb of the previous clause to this one, τεῦχε, are imperfects. As Leonard Palmer 1963 pp.146-148 pointed out, the use of the imperfect after &#x27;establishing&#x27; aorists in epic narrative is &#x27;autopsic&#x27;: it functions to stimulate visualizing/highlighting for the hearers, rather than being reflective of an essential contrast between narrative &#x27;points&#x27; (aorist) and enduring narrative moments (imperfect). The essence of the aorist, one could say, is that it is <em>a-horistos</em> &#x27;undefined&#x27;, or in terms of Prague School linguistics, unmarked as to duration. By contrast, the imperfects <em>do evoke visualization</em> of the past events that they specify an ongoing processes.</p><p>The sentences after the relative clause are linked by the conjunction δέ, the simplest of connectives, and they may not be felt as part of the relative clause. Parataxis rather than sustained subordination is the rule in Homeric style, as Palmer also points out, p. 156, citing Iliad 5.247-8: Αἰνείας δ᾿ υἱὸς μὲν ἀμύμονος Ἀγχίσαο / εὔχεται ἐκγεγάμεν, μήτηρ δέ οἷ ἐστ᾿ Ἀφροδίτη &#x27;Aineias claims that of blameless Anchises / he was born, and his mother is Aphrodite&#x27; (<em>not</em> &#x27;and <em>that</em> his mother was...&#x27;).  But this grammatical point raises a dilemma about the next line, which begins ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27;: if subordination is not normally sustained in Homeric syntax, then the time specification &#x27;right from when&#x27; should refer to the verb of the previous clause, ἐτελείετο, so that the message is that the process of bringing to completion the Διὸς βουλή &#x27;plan/will of Zeus&#x27; began when the two heroes started quarreling. The problem is that observable conventions of the <em>prooimia</em> to epic narratives like the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Odyssey</em>, and the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, require that the starting point of the narrative be specified in the <em>prooimion</em>. So one would think that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27; depends on the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε &#x27;sing,&#x27; in that the poet is asking the muse to <em>sing from</em> the correct starting point. And in fact the starting point actually is (at least nominally) the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, as is made clear by line 8, even though the poem immediately has to backtrack in order to set it up as the starting point.</p><p>On the other hand, is it possible that ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27;  in the wording of this <em>prooimion</em> could also be specifying that the quarrel between the two of them is the point when <em>the plan/will of Zeus</em> (as against the μῆνις of Achilles) started on its path to fulfillment? To put it another way, is the plan of Zeus coterminous with the <em>Iliad, </em>or should we think of it as something that overlaps it, that began before and ended after it? How can we know? I would argue that the plan/will of Zeus is a cause that starts and completes with the song on the basis of the diction in the first song of Demodocus in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82, where the πήματος ἀρχή &#x27;the beginning (sic) of suffering&#x27; began to roll (κυλίνδετο, imperfect) Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς &#x27;because of the plans (plural) of great Zeus.&#x27; It (the suffering) was prophesied by Apollo at Delphi as starting when the ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν &#x27;best (plural) of the Achaeans&#x27; δηριόωντο &#x27;quarreled&#x27; (again, imperfect) — on this point, see G. Nagy <a>here</a> . So the solution to the syntactical dilemma about  ἐξ οὗ δή &#x27;right from when&#x27; is that it refers <em>both</em> to the verb ἐτελείετο &#x27;began to be fulfilled&#x27; <em>and</em> to the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε &#x27;sing!&#x27;, because 1) the convention for the specification of the starting point requires it, 2) the conventions of epic paratactic style require it, and 3) the traditional specifics of the plan/plans of Zeus require it to refer to both. Beginning in 1976, G. Nagy has shown in detail how this song of Demodocus is a multiform of our <em>Iliad</em>, and on that basis we can conceive of its diction as stemming from the same tradition as our <em>Iliad</em>. I note that the <em>prooimion</em> to the <em>Odyssey</em> ends with a globally resumptive pronoun τῶν... &#x27;of these things&#x27; whose antecedent is all of the contents of the <em>prooimion</em>, just as the narrative of Demodocus&#x27; song concludes with ταῦτ&#x27; ἄρ&#x27; ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός &#x27;these things, you see, the very famous singer began to sing&#x27; (8.83). The <em>Iliad</em> <em>prooimion</em> has no such clarifying summative construction, though understanding ἐξ οὗ δή in the way we have means that both ἄειδε at the beginning and ἐτελείετο at the end of the <em>prooimion</em> are the points from which the song begins.</p><p>Incidentally, it is also clear just from our <em>Iliad</em> that there could be at least one other starting point for the tale of Achilles&#x27; wrath. See the comment on <em>Iliad</em> 1.366-369, which also may cast light on the starting point chosen here. There is also a conflicting point of view about <em>the plan of Zeus</em> that was enunciated in the Epic Cycle and that may or may not pertain to the boundaries of the epic tale of Achilles&#x27; anger: in that context, the &#x27;plan of Zeus&#x27;  was to unburden Earth of overpopulation by generating a war that would decimate it. Tying the diction of the Iliadic <em>prooimion</em> with an allusion to that external definition of the Διὸς  βουλή in the <em>Cypria</em> appears to me to conflict with the first two conventions specified above as well as the parallel passage in <em>Odyssey</em> 8.81-82.</p><p>L.

# Iliad 1.97

<p>The paragraph that follows is meant to illustrate, for those who are reading the Iliad for the first time, the kinds of textual variations that we find in the manuscript tradition.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 1.97 οὐδ’ ὅ γε πρὶν λοιμοῖο βαρείας χεῖρας ἀφέξει
 <em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant οὐδ’ ὅ γε πρὶν Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει
 The verse as we see it in our base text shows a reading that matches what we read in the majority of medieval manuscripts. Such a majority of medieval manuscript readings is conventionally known as Ω. The manuscript known as Venetus A is among the Ω manuscripts that shows this reading in its base text. But there is also a variant of this verse, which I call “<em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant,” and this variant verse shows the variant wording Δαναοῖσιν ἀεικέα λοιγὸν ἀπώσει instead of λοιμοῖο βαρείας χεῖρας ἀφέξει. In the Venetus A, this variant wording is actually written out in the space between the Iliadic text and the text of the marginal scholia. The scholia found in that space are known as the text scholia. And the text scholia in this case add a comment after quoting the variant wording: οὕτως αἱ ᾿Αριστάρχου ‘this is the way the (two) manuscripts of Aristarchus (have it)’. Also, in the marginal scholia of the Venetus A, we read a summary of the reportage of Didymus, who says that Aristarchus, in a treatise that he produced in response to one Komanos, preferred the reading of the <em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant. And Aristarchus found the same variant in the manuscript of Rhianos and in the Massaliotike. As for Didymus himself, he found the reading of the <em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant in ‘the (two) manuscripts of Aristarchus’, to which he frequently refers. It can be shown that these two manuscripts used by Didymus had base texts that no longer matched the original base text of Aristarchus, who flourished about 150 years before Didymus (and Aristonicus). Didymus remarks that the other reading that he knows, which is what we read as <em>Iliad</em> 1.97, must have been the reading in the text of Zenodotus. The way that Didymus says this makes me think that he did not have access to the original base text of Aristarchus. The reading that we read in our base text is also given by van Thiel in the base text of his edition of the <em>Iliad</em>. By contrast with van Thiel, Allen and other modern editors give the reading “<em>Iliad</em> 1.97 variant” in their base texts. They do so even though Aristarchus in his base text must have given the same reading that we give in our base text. GN 2010.02.20, updated 2016.02.05.</p>

# Iliad 1.225

<p>This insult, <em>kunos ommat’ ekhōn</em> ‘having the looks of a dog’, directed at Agamemnon by Achilles, exemplifies the language of blame. As also at cross-ref. I.01.159, the translation ‘having the looks of a dog’ conveys the idea that vision is treated as a “two-way street.” When you look at Agamemnon and he looks back at you, he both looks like a dog and he looks as a dog looking back at you. The English word <em>look</em> conveys a comparably two-way attitude: I can say “I look at a disgraceful person” and I can also say “this person looks disgraceful to me.” To convey the two-way attitude in the original Greek here, the wording of the translation gives ‘having the looks of a dog’ instead of merely ‘having the eyes [<em>ommata</em>] of a dog’.</p>

# Iliad 1.231

<p>This insult directed at Agamemnon by Achilles exemplifies the language of blame. Another aspect of the blame here is the double meaning of <em>dēmo</em>- in the compound formation <em>dēmoboros</em>: it could refer either to <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ or to <em>dēmós</em> ‘fat, grease’. Metaphorically, Agamemnon is a ‘devourer of the community’ because he is like a predatory beast that devours the fat of his prey.  </p>

# Iliad 1.320-1.348

<p>The wording of Achilles refers to the future predicament of the Achaeans during the Battle for the Ships; in this phase of the Trojan War, the Achaeans will be losing while the Trojans led by Hector will be winning, on the verge of burning down all the ships of the Achaeans and thus destroying the heroic ancestors of Greek civilization. The threat of such destruction will be signaled by references to the fire of Hector. The word <em>loigos</em> ‘devastation’ refers to the plight of the Achaeans during this phase of the war, when their ships are in danger of being destroyed. For parallel wording, see also I.01.341. For another context—and in this case <em>loigos</em> ‘devastation’ signals a cosmic disaster in the making—see I. 01.398. As for the context that is now being considered, I.01.320–348, the plight of the Achaeans is caused here by the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the hero Achilles; earlier, the Achaeans suffer <em>loigos</em> ‘devastation’, I.01.067, I.01.097, I.01.456, when they are afflicted by the disease that is visited upon them by Apollo. In that case, their plight is caused by the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the god himself.  </p>

# Iliad 1.407-1.412

<p>In the words of the mortal hero Achilles, speaking to his immortal mother Thetis, the status of the hero as ‘best of the Achaeans’ is linked with the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that he experiences over the damage to his <em>tīmē</em>—damage caused by the insult inflicted by Agammemnon in the quarrel between the two heroes. The <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of Achilles leads to his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, which in turn will lead to the collective <em>akhos</em> of all the Achaeans. The <em>horkos</em> ‘oath’ of Achilles, Ι.01.233, which he will swear by as he holds the <em>skēptron</em> ‘scepter’, I.01.234, and which he then throws to the ground to mark his oath, is coextensive with the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that the Achaeans will suffer because of the hero’s <em>mēnis</em>. [[cross-ref. I.01.233–246]] To the extent that the Oath of Achilles is sacred, so too is the coextensive plot of the <em>Iliad</em>. This plot or narrative arc, leading to devastation for the Achaeans, will be enhanced by the <em>mētis</em> or ‘intelligence’ of Thetis, immortal mother of Achilles; and it will be enacted by the Will of Zeus. </p>

# Iliad 1.423-1.425

<p>When the Olympian gods are away from their home situated on Mount Olympus, they customarily attend a dais ‘feast’, Ι.01.424, in the Land of the <em>Aithiopes</em> ‘Aethiopians’, Ι.01.423, whose home is situated at the two farthest imaginable extremities of the known world, that is, both in the Far East and in the Far West, on the banks of the world-encircling river named Ōkeanos, Ο.01.022–024. The idea that the Aethiopians live at both extremes of the world is an example of a theme that can best be described as a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. When the gods attend the stylized feast of the Aethiopians, as when Poseidon visits them at O.01.022–026, they cannot pay attention to the feasts arranged by mortals in the central world of the heroes’ here-and-now. Such feasts would be sacrifices, involving a <em>dais</em> or literally a ‘division’ of meat. The word <em>dais</em> means ‘feast’ because any occasion of feasting in the heroic world requires a ritualized ‘division’ of the cooked meat of animals sacrificed for the occasion. See the comment on O.08.061. The word dais does not distinguish between an occasion where gods and humans feast together, as in the case of marginal figures like the Aethiopians, and an occasion where humans offer sacrifice to the gods, as in the case of the central figures like the heroes in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. For an example of <em>dais</em> with reference to a feast shared by Poseidon with the Aethiopians, see O.01.026 and the comment on O.01.022–026. For an example of <em>dais</em> with reference to a feast resulting from a sacrifice of animals to the gods, see O.08.061.</p>

# Iliad 1.463

<p>The anonymous author of a <em>Life of Homer</em> (on the <em>Lives of Homer</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas), in Vita 1.517–537, argues that Homer, as the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, was an <em>Aioleús</em> ‘Aeolian’, and, in making this argument, he cites among other facts the existence of the form <em>pempṓbola</em> (πεμπώβολα) in the expression here at I.01.463, ‘and the young men were getting ready for him [= the priest Chryses] the five-pronged-forks [<em>pempṓbola</em>] that they were holding in their hands’ (νέοι δὲ παρ’ αὐτὸν ἔχον πεμπώβολα χερσίν). The reasoning given by the author is this: the Aeolians, he says, are the only Greek-speaking people who roast the <em>splánkhna</em> ‘innards’ of a sacrificial animal by using forks that have five prongs instead of three. All other Greeks use three-prong forks. This argument, based on facts of culture, is combined here with an argument based on facts of language: the Aeolic word for ‘five’ is <em>pémpe</em>, as opposed to the Ionic word, which is <em>pénte</em>. So <em>pempṓbola</em> ‘five-prong forks’ must be an Aeolic and not an Ionic word. (On debates about the phonology and morphology of <em>pempṓbola</em>, see Nagy 2011b:173–174.) In highlighting the form <em>pempṓbola</em> ‘having five prongs’, the narrator of Vita 1 is making the point that ‘Homer’ as a speaker of Greek defaults to Aeolic usage when he speaks about customs that are most familiar to him, as in the case of the Aeolian custom of using five-prong forks instead of three-prong forks for roasting sacrificial meat at an animal sacrifice. In terms of such an argument, that is why ‘Homer’ uses the Aeolic dialectal form <em>pémpe</em> ‘five’ instead of the Ionic dialectal form <em>pénte</em> ‘five’. This argument, combining cultural and linguistic facts, can be seen as a metaphor for explaining a linguistic process, to be defined here as the “Aeolic default.” (See also under <em>Aeolic default</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In terms of such a definition, Homeric diction <em>defaults</em> to an Aeolic dialectal form, as here, in the absence of a corresponding Ionic dialectal form. (On <em>Homeric diction</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In general, it is this linguistic process of the “Aeolic default” that generates the Aeolic component of Homeric diction. But this component, it is essential to keep in mind, is secondary to the Ionic component of Homeric diction, which is primary. To put it another way: the Ionic component of Homeric diction is <em>dominant</em>, while the Aeolic component is only <em>recessive</em>. Such a relationship of Ionic and Aeolic components is metaphorized in myths claiming that the birthplace of Homer was the city of Smyrna, which was originally Aeolian but then became Ionian. (For historical background on Smyrna, see under <em>Aeolian Dodecapolis</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In myths about Smyrna as Homer’s birthplace, the identity of Homer as a native of Aeolian Smyrna is superseded by the identity of Homer as a native of Ionian Smyrna. (See again under <em>Aeolian Dodecapolis</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.)</p><p></p><p>* In subject headings, I do not write out accents of transliterated Greek words. But I do write them out in the course of strictly linguistic discussions, as in the discussion here. </p>

# about Aeolic elements in Homeric poetry

<p>The word πεμπώβολα ‘having five prongs’ at <em>Iliad</em> Ι 463 belongs to the dialect family known as Aeolic, as distinct from the "default" language of Homeric poetry, which belongs to the dialect family known as Ionic. The part of this compound adjective that means ‘five’ is Aeolic πέμπε, to be contrasted with Ionic πέντε. In Aeolic, kʷ becomes π before ε, whereas it becοmes τ before ε in Ionic. Further commentary on pp. 173-175 of Nagy 2011, "The Aeolic Component of Homeric Diction,"<br /> http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4138<br /> In that article, I cite an interesting remark in the “pseudo-Herodotean” Life of Homer, Vita 1.517–537. Toward the end of this passage, the author says: 'You see, the Aeolians are the only ones among the Greeks who roast the innards with forks that have five prongs [πεμπώβολα], while the other Greeks use forks that have three prongs. And of course the word that the Aeolians use for ‘five’ [pente] is pempe.'</p>

<p>  </p><p>The narrative of Rhapsody 2 now follows up on the dire consequences of the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon as narrated in Rhapsody 1. Achilles has already withdrawn from the war because of his anger. So, now that this greatest hero of the Achaeans is out of the picture, what will happen next? How will the absence of Achilles affect the story of the Trojan War? Many new doubts and fears set in, and the resolve of the Achaeans is harshly tested. There is negative talk, and there are omens. Thus the story of the Trojan War, as told and retold countless times in the distant past, must now be retold yet again, and Rhapsody 2 will set the terms for the retelling still to come. For setting the terms, Rhapsody 2 will need a new Catalogue of Ships, now happening in the tenth year of the war, as a replacement for any old Catalogue that would have logically happened already in the first year. This new Catalogue is of course not really new: rather, it is the oldest possible Catalogue that is now being renewed for the newest possible retelling of the Trojan War, reconsidered in the glaring light of the grim consequences facing the Achaeans now that Achilles has withdrawn from the war. With these consequences in view, the Catalogue will reassess all the Achaean heroes involved in the Trojan War. Of special interest will be the role of Protesilaos, who had been the first Achaean to die in the war, as a model for Achilles. As the Master Narrator notes most ruefully, Protesilaos is now terribly missed by his fellow warriors. So too will Achilles be missed.</p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/protesilaos5.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>On the reverse side of the coin:<br/>Inscription: ΘΗΒΑΙΩΝ.<br/>Pictured: the Greek hero Protesilaos, the first Achaean to step on Trojan soil and, according to the myth, the first to die in the Trojan War. <br/>The myth is retold in <em>Iliad</em> 2.695–709.</p>

# Iliad 2.1-6

<p>The False Dream that is sent by Zeus to the sleeping Agamemnon is a false Will of Zeus. Whereas the true Will of Zeus is the real plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, as noted in the comments on I.01.005 and on I.01.558–559, the false Will of Zeus is a false plot for the epic, since the eventual victory of the Achaeans over the Trojans in the tenth year of the Trojan War will not be quick and easy and painless but prolonged and difficult and painful. In the real plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, the Achaeans will suffer a new pain: they will find themselves on the losing side of the Trojan War while the Trojans will now be on the winning side. This temporary reversal in the tenth year of the Trojan War goes back to the moment when Agamemnon damages the tīmē ‘honor’ of Achilles. Because this damage was tolerated by the Achaeans, they will suffer—and keep on suffering—the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of being on the losing side until the fire of Hector finally reaches the ships of the Achaeans at the climax of the Battle for the Ships. By way of this reversal, through the Will of Zeus, Achilles will recover the <em>tīmē</em> or ‘honor’ that he had lost. At I.02.003-004, Zeus is shown in the act of planning this reversal: it is the Will of Zeus that he will give <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ to Achilles, and this honor, it is said here, will require the destruction of many warriors at the Battle for the Ships. Such destruction will be a source of great grief for the Achaeans. For them, victory at Troy will now become a most prolonged and difficult and painful goal to achieve. Such is the real plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, whereas the false plot that tells of a quick and easy and painless victory is only a dream. Nevertheless, the dream of this false plot is still a part of the real plot, since the Will of Zeus subsumes the false plot. The dream, then, is a subplot. After all, it is the <em>boulē</em> ‘will’ of Zeus to send the dream at I.02.005, and this <em>boulē</em> is here described as the ‘best’ <em>boulē</em> in the sense of a ‘best plan’ for now. The plan of Zeus here is a subplot that is the best of all possible subplots because it is part of the overarching plot of the Iliad, a master epic that subsumes all of its various subplots.  </p>

# Iliad 2.7-15

<p>The False Dream, personified, is instructed by Zeus to tell Agamemnon that the victory of the Achaeans over the Trojans will be quick and easy and painless, since the goddess Hērā at a council of the divinities has supposedly persuaded the other gods to acquiesce to such a victory. The instructions of Zeus as formulated at I.02.011–015 are carried out by the False Dream, who delivers the formulation to the sleeping Agamemnon at I.02.028–032. Later on, Agamemnon retells this formulation at I.02.065–69. I note that Zeus does not instruct the False Dream to say that these instructions are the Will of Zeus, though the wording of the False Dream implies it. The implication happens in an additional verse that follows the False Dream’s formulation as the messenger of Zeus at I.02.028–032. In this additional verse, at I.02.033, the False Dream says that the ultimate doom of the Trojans will be caused by Zeus. And the same addition is made in the retelling of Agamemnon, at I.02.070 following I.02.065–69. But there is no such corresponding addition after the verses containing the original formulation of Zeus at I.02.011–015. In any case, what results from the formulation delivered by the False Dream as messenger of Zeus is that Agamemnon will misunderstand what the god really wants. Agamemnon will think that victory over the Trojans will now be quick and easy and painless. But Zeus plans instead just the opposite: in order to restore the <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ of Achilles, Zeus will make sure that the struggles awaiting the Achaeans will be prolonged and difficult and painful, so that the Achaeans will now be on the losing side until the fire of Hector finally reaches the ships of the Achaeans at the Battle for the Ships. Likewise in the “micro-Iliad” of O.8.072–083, which is the First Song of Demodokos, Agamemnon misunderstands the Will of Zeus, not knowing what pains the god is planning to inflict on the Achaeans as well as the Trojans.  </p>

# Iliad 2.36-2.40

<p>These verses describe most accurately how Agamemnon, dreaming his False Dream, misunderstands the Will of Zeus. As we read at I.02.036 here, Agamemnon is thinking things that will definitely not ‘come to fulfillment’, <em>teleîsthai</em>, through the will of the god. As we read further at I.02.037, Agamemnon thinks that he will now capture Troy in just one day, in accordance with the Will of Zeus. Of course he is wrong to think this, as we read still further at I.02.038–040, since Zeus is now planning to inflict many more <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ in battle not only for the Trojans but also, more pertinently, for the Achaeans. The Trojan War is about to be prolonged for the Achaeans, causing them much more hardship and pain.  </p>

# Iliad 2.41

<p>When Agamemnon wakes up from dreaming the False Dream, he experiences the sensation of an <em>omphē</em> ‘oracular voice’ that has just now been poured all over him. This idea of <em>omphē</em> as an ‘oracular voice’ (the word is cognate with English <em>song</em>) is picked up by the word <em>ossa</em> ‘oracular voice’ at I.02.093, which refers there to the personified False Dream who had announced himself as the <em>Dios angelos</em> ‘messenger’ of Zeus to the sleeping Agamemnon at I.02.026. In the context of Theognis 1.808 and elsewhere, <em>omphē</em> refers to the oracular voice of the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi. Such contexts show that <em>omphē</em> in the sense of ‘oracular voice’ is relevant to the misunderstanding experienced by Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 2. Just as Agamemnon misunderstands the oracular voice that is mediated by the False Dream, so also he misunderstands the oracular voice of the god Apollo himself in the First Song of Demodokos O.08.072–083. At verses 77–78 of that “micro-Iliad,” it is said that Agamemnon was happy to see Odysseus and Achilles quarelling; at verses 79–83, it is said that such a quarrel was predicted by the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi to Agamemnon when this over-king went there for an oracular consultation. And at verses 81–82 it is said that this quarrel was really a sign that foretold a great <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ that was about to befall the Achaeans as well as the Trojans in the Trojan War.  </p>

# Iliad 2.110

<p>This is the second occurrence of the noun <em>therapōn</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>; the plural form here is <em>therapontes</em>. The surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> in Homeric diction is ‘attendant’, and a fitting example is the word’s first occurrence in the <em>Iliad</em>, at I.01.321; the deeper meaning, however, is ‘ritual substitute’. In contexts where the plural <em>therapontes</em> in combination with <em>Arēos</em> ‘of Ares’ is applied to the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives (at I.02.110, to the Danaoi) as a grouping of warriors, the deeper meaning is more evident than in other contexts. When a warrior is killed in war, he becomes a <em>therapōn</em> or ‘ritual substitute’ who dies for Ares by becoming identical to the war god at the moment of death; then, after death, the warrior is eligible to become a cult hero who serves as a sacralized ‘attendant’ of the war god in contexts of hero cult.</p>

As we read at I.02.220–221, Thersites has his quarrels especially with these two heroes, and the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ as used here at I.02.221, together with the corresponding noun <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ as used elsewhere, refers programmatically to the poetics of blame.  </p>

# Iliad 2.325

<p>The expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> ‘its glory [<em>kleos</em>] will never perish’ (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται), as here at I.02.325, is parallel with <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413, which can be translated ‘the glory [<em>kleos</em>] will be imperishable [<em>aphthiton</em>]’. This parallelism shows that <em>aphthito</em>- at I.09.413 and elsewhere was understood to be not just long-lasting, as some have thought, but eternal. As for the interpretation ‘the glory [<em>kleos</em>] will be imperishable [<em>aphthiton</em>]’, we will see in the comment on I.09.413 that an alternative interpretation is also possible: ‘and there will be a glory [<em>kleos</em>] that is imperishable’.  </p>

<p>The petrified serpent is equated with the story of Troy, and the word <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ here conveys the inevitable outcome of that story. The prophecy expressed by <em>teleîn</em> reveals a poetics of unchangeability in narrating the story. And the concretization of such unchangeability is visualized as the petrifaction of the serpent. The imperfective aspect of the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ here is referring to the story of Troy as it is still being told, as it is still in progress.  </p>

# Iliad 2.402-429 Anchor Comment on: prayers heeded or not heeded by gods

<p>Epitomized from Nagy 2015 §85. Here at I.02.402–429, when Agamemnon sacrifices an ox to Zeus, I.02.402–403, 422, he makes a wish-in-prayer, as expressed by the verb <em>eukhesthai</em>, I.02.411, that he will conquer the city of Troy, I.02.414–415, and kill Hector together with as many other enemies as possible, I.02.416–418—all within the space of one single day, I.02.413. But Zeus refuses to bring this prayer to fulfillment, I.02.419—even though the god accepts the offering of the sacrifice, I.02.420, and even though Agamemnon and his guests go ahead and cook the meat after killing the ox, dividing the beef among themselves and then feasting on it together, I.02.421–429. Although the narrative leaves it open whether, one fine day, Agamemnon will still succeed in his wish to conquer the city, I.02.419, it is made clear that the present wish-in-prayer, as performed by the hero on the occasion of this particular sacrifice, is a failure, I.02.419. To paraphrase in Latin terms: the <em>vōtum</em> as a ‘wish-in-prayer’ is not granted here.  </p>

# Iliad 2.402-2.429

<p>Epitome from Nagy 2015 §§103:</p><p>Menelaos seems to be idiosyncratic in his arrivals at sacrifices. A striking example is the passage here at I.02.402–429 where Agamemnon sacrifices an ox to Zeus, I.02.402–403, 422, and makes a wish-in-prayer, as expressed by the verb eukhesthai, I.02.411, that he will conquer the city of Troy, I.02.414–415, and kill Hector together with as many other enemies as possible, I.02.416–418. To attend this sacrifice as well as the feast that follows the sacrifice, Agamemnon invites six heroes, I.02.404–407. But the hero Menelaos is not included in this group of six. Nevertheless, Menelaos does manage to attend, arriving as the seventh hero, without having been invited to the sacrifice, I.02.408–409: rather, he comes automatos, which is conventionally interpreted to mean ‘of his own accord’, or, to put it into popular idiom, ‘automatically’, I.02.408. But the reason that is given here to explain why Menelaos comes automatos is uncanny: it is because, the narrative says, Menelaos can read the mind of his brother, I.02.408–409. </p>

tags: dominant and recessive twins, automatos 'having a mind of his own', A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 2.408

<p>Epitome from Nagy 2015 §104: </p><p>Point 1. The ability of Menelaos to read the mind of Agamemnon indicates a special meaning for the adjective <em>automatos</em> here. On the one hand, if Menelaos comes to the feast ‘on his own’, then we can expect his mind to be ‘operating by itself’—which is the meaning built into <em>automatos</em> as a compounding of the element <em>auto</em>- ‘self’ with the element <em>ma-t-</em>, derived from the root *<em>men-</em>/*<em>mn-</em> meaning ‘mind’. So, Menelaos has a mind of his own. On the other hand, something unexpected is going on here: this mind of Menelaos, exceptionally, can read the mind of the brother, and so <em>automatos</em> in this context means not only ‘having a mind of his own’ but also ‘having the same mind’ as the brother has. In terms of this interpretation, Agamemnon and Menelaos have the same mind because they share their own selves with each other. We can find mythological patterns of twin-like behavior in Homeric descriptions of Agamemnon and Menelaos, and these patterns affect even their thinking. See Frame 2009:177, with a further reference at pp. 72–73 n. 156. More from Frame pp. 209–215: Also, Menelaos in the <em>Iliad</em> consistently fails to take the initiative whenever he undertakes an activity together with his brother. In such situations, Menelaos is recessive in his twinned thinking, while Agamemnon is dominant.</p><p>Point 2. There is an allusion in Plato <em>Symposium</em> 174b-d to the wording here in I.02.408. And, on the basis of Athenaeus 1.8a, we can reconstruct a relevant proverb, to which Plato’s text is also alluding. This proverb can be reconstructed as αὐτόματοι δ’ ἀγαθοὶ ἀγαθῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασι ‘automatically do the noble go to the feasts of the noble’. In such a context, I add, not only does each noble person have ‘a mind of his own’: that mind is also the ‘same’ mind that the other noble persons have. The point is, ‘like-minded’ or ‘same-minded’ people congregate with each other automatically at dinners.   </p>

# Iliad 2.484-2.487

<p>The immediacy of the Master Narrator’s performance here is counterbalanced by an attitude of remoteness from the composition. Such a counterbalance indicates the Narrator’s deference to the epic tradition of Homeric poetry. The Narrator does not claim that he <em>knows</em> the tradition: instead, he says he just ‘hears’ it from the Muses, and this act of ‘hearing’ is <em>kleos</em>, derived from the verb <em>kluein</em> ‘hear’. The literal meaning of <em>kleos</em> as ‘the thing heard’ has an enormous prestige that translates into the idealized meaning of  ‘glory, fame’ as applied to the composition and performance of Homeric poetry. The Narrator of Homeric poetry is proud of his capacity to ‘hear’. To hear what? To hear ‘the thing heard’, which is <em>kleos</em>. This capacity translates into ‘glory, fame’ not only for Homeric poetry but also for the poet who performs the poetry. Such a poet claims access to both the form and the content of what he ‘hears’ the Muses tell him. </p>

tags: re-invocation of Muse(s), ennepein 'narrate, tell', Mousa 'Muse', singing as narrating, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 2.484

<p>In this verse, which can be translated ‘tell me now, you Muses who have your dwellings on Mount Olympus’, we see a rhyming of … Mousai, situated before the primary mid-verse word-break, with … <em>ekhousai</em>, situated before the verse-final word-break. Such rhyming is rare and archaizing. (On archaic patterns of rhyming in early Greek poetry, see Nagy 1974:99–101.) Of special interest here is the invocation of the Muses in the plural, to be contrasted with the invocation of the Muse in the singular at I.01.001. See the comment on I.02.761. On the poetics of re-invocation here, there will be more to say in the comments on I.02.761, Ι.11.218, I.14.508, I.16.112. For now, it suffices to observe that the re-invocation of the Muses here at I.02.484 pictures these goddesses in the plural, by contrast with the singular Muse who had been initially invoked at I.01.001. There will be another invocation of the singular Muse at I.02.761, to be followed by invocations of plural Muses at Ι.11.218, I.14.508, and I.16.112. In the case of each invocation, there is a heightened level of poetic self-awareness about the importance of what is about to be narrated. Here at I.02.484, for example, the Master Narrator shows his concern about the need for accuracy in re-creating a comprehensive catalogue of essentially all the cultural ancestors of the Greek-speaking world. On other occasions of re-invocation, there will be comparable poetic concerns, as we will see in comments still to come. </p>

# Iliad 2.547-2.548

<p>Although Erekhtheus here is born of the goddess Gaia as ‘Mother Earth’, he is nursed by the goddess Athena. This division of labor between Gaia and Athena is signaled by the verb <em>trephein</em> ‘nourish, nurse’, revealing a pattern of differentiation between older and newer concepts of a mother goddess. In terms of an older concept, an autochthonous hero would be both born of and nursed by a mother goddess, visualized primarily as the Earth. We may compare the wording in Plato <em>Menexenus</em> 237b on Mother Gaia, ‘the one who gave birth, nourished [<em>trephein</em>], and accepted [them] into her care’ (τῆς τεκούσης καὶ θρεψάσης καὶ ὑποδεξαμένης), with reference to the Athenians as her autochthonous children.

# Iliad 2.557-2.558

<p>Tradition has it that the Athenian statesman Solon once cited these verses in the context of a territorial dispute between the city-states of Athens and Megara. Such a tradition shows that myths were used as juridical evidence. Especially useful were myths mediated by prestigious forms of poetry like the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. In earlier phases of Homeric poetry when this medium could still be described as a living oral tradition, any verses that would commonly be recognized as part of this poetry could thereby become acceptable as a form of proof in arguing a territorial claim. In later phases of Homeric poetry, however, when it was no longer a living oral tradition, antiquarians were prone to interpret verses once cited in territorial disputes as interpolations promoted by those whose political interests were served by tampering with the textual transmission of Homeric poetry.  </p>

# Iliad 2.681-694

<p>The first part of this micro-narrative, I.02.681–685, highlights various territories unified here under the leadership of Achilles, who sails in fifty ships with warriors originating from these territories, I.02.685. Relevant names of special interest here are: ‘Pelasgian’ Argos at I.02.681, <em>Phthīē</em> and <em>Hellás</em> at I.02.683, <em>Myrmidónes</em> and <em>Héllēnes</em> and <em>Akhaioí</em> at I.02.684. The second part of this micro-narrative, I.02.686–694, highlights the fact that the warriors who sailed on the fifty ships and were led by Achilles have lost their leader, since Achilles is now refusing to participate in the Trojan War. And a sub-part of this micro-narrative, I.02.689–694, retells the story about the anger of Achilles over the seizing of Briseis by Agamemnon.  </p>

# Iliad 2.689-694 Anchor Comment on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 1

<p>See also anchor comment at I.09.128–131 and at I.09.270–272 on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 2.</p><p>See also anchor comment at I.11.624–627 on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 3.</p><p>These verses at I.02.689–694 focus on Briseis, war-prize of Achilles. An aristocratic woman, she was taken captive by Achilles when he conquered the city of Lyrnessos and killed her husband Mynes, who was defending that city, I.02.690–691. The story about the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and about his capturing of Briseis stemmed from poetic traditions that were distinctly Aeolian in origin. And this Aeolian origin has to do with a most basic fact about the principal hero of the <em>Iliad</em>: <em>Achilles himself was an Aeolian, and he originated from a poetic tradition that was Aeolian</em>. Achilles was an Aeolian not only in the limited sense that he was born and raised in Aeolian Thessaly, to the west of the Aegean Sea: much more than that, the poetic traditions about this hero’s conquests of territories to the east of the Aegean, across the sea from Thessaly, shaped his identity as a prime hero not only for the Thessalians in the European mainland but also for all Aeolians, including the Aeolic-speaking populations that inhabited the coastal mainland of northern Asia Minor and the outlying islands of Lesbos and Tenedos. As we will see in the course of further analysis, it was the myths about the conquests of Achilles in the East, including the regions of Troy and beyond, that shaped the ultimately Aeolian identity of the Aeolic-speaking populations that inhabited those eastern regions—which as I noted in the anchor comment at I.01.463 included the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos as well as the coastal mainland of most of northern Asia Minor. The conquests of Achilles in that whole area can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologized a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” by Aeolians from Thessaly. (See Nagy 2011b:171–173.) It is in this light that we may view the hero’s conquest of Lyrnessos, which was a city located in the region of Troy, south of Mount Ida. For more details about the location of Lyrnessos, see the comment on I.20.089–102. The conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles was part of the myths conveyed by Aeolian poetic traditions, and that is how the captive woman Briseis becomes part of that tradition. In other words, Briseis is figured as an Aeolian because she is appropriated by the Aeolian poetic tradition. Likewise, as we see at I.02.691 here, Achilles conquered not only the city of Lyrnessos but also the city of Thēbē. This parallelism of Lyrnessos and Thēbē is most significant, as we will now see. Thēbē was originally not an Aeolian city, and the non-Aeolian identity of Thēbē is accentuated by way of a detail: as we read at I.06.397 and at I.06.415, the inhabitants of Thēbē before its destruction by Achilles had been non-Greek <em>Kilikes</em> ‘Cilicians’. And there is a striking parallelism here between Thēbē and Lyrnessos: the same non-Greek population had reportedly inhabited Lyrnessos as well. We read in Strabo 13.1.7 C586 that the region of the <em>Kilikes</em> was evenly divided between the cities of Thēbē and Lyrnessos. Nevertheless, as in the case of Lyrnessos, the poetic tradition about the conquest of Thēbē by Achilles was Aeolian. And when Achilles conquered the city of Thēbē, as we see at I.01.366–369, he captured there an aristocratic woman named Chryseis. So, as in the case of Briseis, Chryseis too becomes an Aeolian by virtue of being appropriated by the Aeolian poetic tradition about the conquests of the Aeolian hero Achilles. In the case of Chryseis, she was allotted by the Achaeans to Agamemnon as his very own war-prize, Ι.01.369, while Briseis had been allotted to Achilles, Ι.01.392. (For background on the Aeolian poetic traditions about Briseis and Chryseis, I strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography.) And now we come to a third aristocratic woman who is likewise identified by way of parallel Aeolian connections: she is Andromache, wife of Hector. Just as Achilles captured the women Chryseis and Briseis when he conquered the cities of Thēbē and Lyrnessos respectively, so too Achilles would have captured Andromache at the same time—if she had not been already married off to Hector, who had brought her as his bride to Troy before the Achaeans ever even arrived at Troy. Andromache originated from the city of Thēbē, as we see at I.06.394–396, and we have already seen at I.01.366–369 that Thēbē was the place where Achilles captured Chryseis when he conquered that city. The father of Andromache, Eëtion, was the king of the <em>Kilikes</em> who had inhabited the city of Thēbē, I.06.395–398, and he was killed by Achilles when that hero conquered this city, I.06.416–420. There is an important parallel noted by Strabo 13.1.7 C586 (also 13.1.61 C611–612): the husband of Briseis, Mynes, was evidently the king of the other <em>Kilikes</em> who had inhabited the city of Lyrnessos; Strabo draws attention to this parallelism in the context of citing I.02.691 and I.19.295, both of which verses refer to the time when Achilles conquered Lyrnessos and killed Mynes. In sum, all three of the women who are highlighted in these Iliadic contexts—Chryseis, Briseis, and Andromache—were appropriated by the Aeolian poetic traditions about the conquests of Achilles the Aeolian. And such Aeolian poetic traditions of songmaking are directly attested in Song 44 of Sappho about the wedding of Hector and Andromache. The songs attributed to Sappho as also to Alcaeus, both of whom are dated around 600 BCE, originate from the Aeolian island of Lesbos. There will be more to say about these traditions in the anchor comment at I.09.128–131 / 270–272 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 2.  </p>

# Iliad 2.689-2.694

<p>The Iliad refers to a variety of epic deeds performed by Achilles, and the relative chronology of these deeds is in many cases situated before or after the time-frame of the <em>Iliad</em> as we know it. One category of deeds stands out: before he joins the other Achaean leaders at Troy, Achilles conquers various places that are culturally identifiable as Aeolian <em>as a result of his conquest</em>, and, in each case, he captures aristocratic women who are likewise Aeolian—<em>but only as a result of their being captured by Achilles the Aeolian</em>. For a definition of ‘Aeolian’, see the anchor comment at I.01.463. The significance of the Aeolian identification of Achilles—and, by extension, of the women he captured—is analyzed in the anchor comment that immediately follows, at I.02.689–694; also at I.09.128–131 / I.09.270–272 and at I.11.624–627.  </p>

<p>This micro-narrative tells how Protesilaos, who was the first Achaean to die in the Trojan War, was sorely missed by his people back home in his native land of Thessaly. At I.02.703 and I.02.709, it is said that the natives of this land ‘feel a longing’ for the hero after his death at Troy, and this ‘longing’ is expressed by way of the verb <em>potheîn </em>‘long for, desire’. The wording here, it can be argued, shows an indirect reference to the worship of Protesilaos as a cult hero. </p>

<p>The Master Narrator addresses here a singular Muse: see the comment on I.02.761. The Muse is asked for an answer to the Iliadic question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The answer of the Muse is that Achilles is the best—and that Ajax is the second-best within the framework of the <em>Iliad</em>. The formulation of the Muse’s answer is an exquisite exercise in ring-composition.  </p>

# Iliad 2.789

<p>The formula πάντες ὁμηγερέες, ἠμὲν νέοι ἠδὲ γέροντες used to describe the gathered assembly of Trojans as composed of “both young men and old men” (ἠμὲν νέοι ἠδὲ γέροντες) has the underlying meaning of “all men of a certain group who count.” This meaning can be discerned by comparing the other contexts in which it is used. In <em>Iliad</em> 9 Diomedes uses this formula to say that both the young men and old men of the Argives (that is, all men of the Argives who count) know how Agamemnon spoke to Diomedes earlier (ταῦτα δὲ πάντα / ἴσασ’ Ἀργείων ἠμὲν νέοι ἠδὲ γέροντες, <em>Iliad</em> 9.35–36). Odysseus reminds Achilles that his father Peleus advised him to avoid strife so that both the young men and the old men of the Argives (that is, all the men of the Argives who count) would honor him (ληγέμεναι δ’ ἔριδος κακομηχάνου, ὄφρά σε μᾶλλον τίωσ’ Ἀργείων ἠμὲν νέοι ἠδὲ γέροντες, <em>Iliad</em> 9.257–258). These uses found in our <em>Iliad</em> are always in the same metrical position. By contrast, a formula found in the <em>Odyssey</em> describing “young men and old,” νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί, seems instead to emphasize the large number of men involved (<em>Odyssey</em> 1.395 and <em>Odyssey</em> 8.58), not the “completeness” or social importance of the set.</p>

<p>The word <em>kolōnē</em> ‘tumulus’ here at I.02.811 refers to the place where, as we read further at I.02.814, the <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ of an otherworldly femaie named Murinē is located; she is pictured here as <em>polu-skarthmos</em> ‘taking many leaps and bounds’.

# Iliad 2.867-2.869

<p>In Homeric poetry, both in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, there is a pattern of avoidance in making overt references to the twelve confederated states known as the Ionian Dodecapolis. In Herodotus 1.142.3, the locations of these states are listed as follows: Miletus, Myous, Priene, Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Klazomenai, Phocaea, the island-states of Samos and of Chios, and, lastly, Erythrai. Even in the two exceptional cases where Homeric poetry refers to any of these locations, what gets highlighted is merely the place, not the status of that place as a city-state or, when it comes to Chios and Samos, as an island-state. In one of these two exceptional cases, the mention of Chios at Ο.03.170 and at O.03.172 refers not to the famous island-state that Chios eventually became but simply to the island. In the other case, which we have here at I.02.868, the mention of Miletus refers not to the spectacularly famous <em>polis</em> or ‘city-state’ that Miletus eventually became but simply to the city—and this city is supposedly not even Greek as of yet. It is as if the Ionians had not yet settled Miletus: instead, Miletus at the time of the Trojan War is supposedly inhabited only by Carians, who do not even speak Greek: at I.02.867, these Carians who inhabit Miletus are described as barbaro-phōnoi ‘speakers of a barbarous language’.  </p>

Just as Rhapsody 2 needed a new Catalogue of Ships—or, again to say it more accurately—a renewed Catalogue, so also Rhapsody 3 needs a new look at Helen. It seems as if the Trojan War is happening all over again, starting from the very beginning. The old grievances of Menelaos about the abduction of Helen by Paris can now be renewed and even relived, becoming fresh new grievances as the estranged husband and the new lover proceed to engage in mortal combat. But this one-on-one struggle over life and death will soon modulate into a renewal of all-out war between the Achaeans and the Trojans.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Antalya_Museum_-_Sarkophag_5b_Aphrodite_verbirgt_Paris_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Menelaos pulling Paris by the helmet.

# Iliad 3.100

<p>The Trojan War is <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. See also <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at Pindar <em>Paean</em> 6.50–53. That is how this war is seen in the words of Menelaos the Achaean, who claims a juridical grievance on the part of the Achaeans against the Trojans. In terms of the thinking revealed by these words, the beginning of the strife was the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaos the Achaean, by Paris the Trojan. Accentuating the idea that this juridical grievance of Menelaos was an affair of state is the reference to Paris here by way of his princely name, Alexandros. In royal Hittite correspondences where the Hittite king speaks to and about the king of Ahhiyawa—which is the Hittite way of referring to the land of the Achaeans—we find occasional references to a princely figure by the name of <em>Alaksandu</em>, which is the Hittite pronunciation of Alexandros (Nagy 2015.07.22§25). By contrast, the name <em>Paris</em> is on the surface merely a shepherd’s name (on the symbolism, however, of the shepherd as a king-in-the-making, see Nagy 2009:309). In any case, the <em>eris</em> or ‘strife’ between the Achaeans and the Trojans was caused by ‘my strife’— according to Menelaos the Achaean. To say it more precisely in his words, the Trojan War was ‘because of my strife’ (εἵνεκ’ ἐμῆς ἔριδος). Correspondingly, the <em>arkhē</em> or ‘beginning’ of the strife as begun by Paris=Alexandros was ‘his beginning’ of that strife. To say it again more precisely in the words of Menelaos, the beginning of the Trojan War was ‘because of the beginning on the part of Paris=Alexandros’ (Ἀλεξάνδρου ἕνεκ’ ἀρχῆς). Here it is important to compare what was narrated in the <em>Cypria</em>, which as an epic belonging to a set of epics known as the epic Cycle. In the <em>Cypria</em> of the epic Cycle as also in the <em>Iliad</em>, the Trojan War is likewise seen as <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. As we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em> in Proclus 102.13–19 (ed. Allen 1912), it all began at a feast celebrating the marriage of Thetis and Peleus—a marriage that led to the conception of Achilles himself. It was the Will of Zeus that <em>Eris</em> ‘Strife’ personified would bring about a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ among the gods that would ultimately result in the Trojan War (Proclus 102.14/15 on <em>Eris</em>/<em>neikos</em>). As we see further in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em>, Proclus 102.14–19, the Eris/neikos extends to the figure of Paris, who has to choose from among Hērā, Athena, and Aphrodite, <em>Cypria</em>/Proclus 102.14–19. This Judgment of Paris is recapitulated at I.24.025–030: the fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽). These verbs <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ express both the social and the poetic significance of praise and blame respectively.  </p>

# Iliad 3.059

<p>In situations of strife among heroes as warriors, there is contention over status. Quarreling happens, as indicated here by way of the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’. Positive things about each warrior need to be praised, but negative things need to be blamed. At stake for each contending warrior-hero is the honor that he is apportioned in the course of any contention, and the contention itself is expressed by way of negative and positive speech, that is, by way of blame and praise respectively. Such an apportioning of honor is the essence of a warrior-hero’s aisa, which is visualized not only as a portion of plundered goods that gets apportioned to each warrior after such goods are communally divided (as at I.18.327) but also, in general, as a warrior’s ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.01.416, and so on). The same can be said about the word <em>moira</em>, which can mean not only a ‘portion’ of plundered goods (as at O.11.534) or even of sacrificial meat (as at O.03.066) but also, in general, ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.06.488, and so on). What is at stake, in the long run, is the aisa or moira of each contending warrior-hero. And this <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em>, in the sense of a ‘portion’ that is being apportioned, becomes the warrior’s ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’ in the poetry that tells about him. To restate in colloquial English: <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> becomes the “bone of contention” in the language of praise and blame. Here at I.03.059 as also at I.06.333, Paris actually accepts the words of blame directed at him by his quarreling brother. He says that these words fit his own <em>aisa</em>, admitting that Hector’s words of blame here are <em>kat’ aisan</em> ‘in accord with <em>aisa’</em> (κατ’ αἶσαν) and not <em>huper aisan</em> ‘in disaccord with <em>aisa’</em> (ὑπὲρ αἶσαν). We find in Homeric diction comparable combinations of <em>moira</em>, synonym of <em>aisa</em>, with the same adverbs/prepositions <em>kata</em> ‘in accord with’ and <em>huper</em> ‘in disaccord with’, as for example in the case of <em>kata moiran</em> at I.09.059 (κατὰ μοῖραν) and <em>huper moiran</em> at I.20.336 (ὑπὲρ μοῖραν). Further, when the actual words of praise or blame fit the <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> of a given warrior-hero, they will fit not only his destiny but even the overall plot of the epic, as at I.16.707 in the case of <em>aisa</em> and at Ι.16.853 in the case of <em>moira</em>. The plot of epic has a destiny of its own, and this overarching destiny integrates all the individual destinies of the heroes who populate the epic.  </p>

# Iliad 3.125-3.128

<p>Helen is seen here at I.03.125–128 for the first time in the <em>Iliad</em>. She is shown in the act of pattern-weaving. Instead of singing while weaving, she weaves her song into the web that she pattern-weaves. See also the comment on I.22.440–441, where comparable wording shows Andromache weaving a web of her own. In the case of Helen at I.03.125–128 here, the song that she weaves into her web is about the <em>aethloi</em> (<em>āthloi</em>) ‘ordeals’ of war suffered by Trojans and Achaeans alike—a war they suffered all because of her. The song of the Trojan War is the song of the <em>Iliad</em>—and it is Helen’s song. Purple is the dominant color of Helen’s web, matching the blood of war that stains her song. There also exists, however, a variant epithet for the web that Helen weaves at I.03.126: this diplax ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’ is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. For more on this variant <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’, see the comment on I.22.440-441 on the web of Andromache.  </p>

# Iliad 3.237

<p>Kastōr and Poludeukēs, latinized as Castor and Pollux, are the Divine Twins, sons of Zeus. Another name for them is Dioskouroi ‘sons of Zeus’. Kastōr and Poludeukēs are also mentioned at O.11.300. The wording of I.03.237 and of O.11.300 is cognate with the wording we find a fragment of Stesichorus: see PH 458. (On the etymology of <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, I epitomize from PasP 51.) The noun <em>Poludeúkēs</em> as a name is straightforwardly related to the adjective <em>poludeukḗs</em>, in that the recessive accent of the name is typical of the naming function, as we see from such morphologically related formations as <em>Poluneíkēs</em> ‘having many quarrels [es-stem <em>neîkos</em>]’ or ‘having quarrels in many different ways’ (or ‘many times’). In the mythological functions of the divine figure <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, the idea of continuity, conveyed by the root *<em>deuk</em>-, seems as evident as that of variety, since the Divine Twins are models of consistency, perseverance, reliability (as in <em>Homeric Hymn</em> 33). In an astrological sense, we could say that <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, in the role of Morning Star, is ‘repeating many times’, the symbol of many happy returns. (On the Divine Twins as alternating Morning Star / Evening Star, I offer an analysis in GM 258–259.) And the repetition can be visualized as a cyclical one—a pattern of eternal return. There is a striking semantic and morphological parallel in <em>poluderkḗs</em> ‘seeing in many different ways’ (or ‘many times’), epithet of the dawn-goddess Eos in Hesiod (<em>Theogony</em> 451). </p>

In general, this epithet is applied to the following goddesses: Aphrodite, as here at I.03.374, also at I.05.131 and I.05.312; Athena at I.02.548 and I.04.128 and I.04.515; Artemis at O.20.061; Persephone at O.11.217; Ate at I.19.091; the Muses at I.02.491–492 (plural) and O.01.010 (singular); finally, Helen at O.04.227 (see the comment there). This epithet <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ is cognate with Vedic Sanskrit<em> divás duhitár-</em> (/ <em>duhitár- divás</em>) ‘daughter of the sky[-god]’, epithet of <em>Uṣas</em>-, goddess of the dawn, whose name actually means ‘dawn’. The Greek divinities Eos and Helios—<em>Ēōs</em> means ‘Dawn’ and <em>Hēlios</em> means ‘Sun’—are comparable to (and cognate with) the Indic divinities <em>Uṣas</em>- ‘Dawn’ and <em>Sūrya</em>- ‘Sun’. In Homeric diction, however, Eos the goddess of the dawn is never described by the epithet <em>thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, and this fact corresponds to another fact: Homeric tradition preserves no myth about Eos as a daughter of Zeus. Eos is conventionally described as <em>rhododaktulos</em> ‘rosy-fingered’, an epithet that has the same metrical shape as <em>thugatēr Dios</em>, uu–uu. For more on <em>rhododaktulos</em> as an epithet for Eos the goddess of the dawn, see the comment at O.12.1–010 on Ōkeanos. </p>

# Iliad 4.110

<p>The collocation <em>ērare tektōn</em> (ἤραρε τέκτων) ‘the joiner joined together’ is relevant to the etymologies of both the verb and the noun here, which are respectively <em>ar-ar-iskein</em> ‘fit together, join together’ and <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’. Although the Indo-European verb-root from which <em>tektōn</em> is derived, *<em>tek(s)</em>-, is no longer attested in Greek, it does in fact survive in Latin as <em>texō</em>, which can refer to the craft of woodworking, not only the craft of weaving. Correspondingly, although there is no Greek attestation of an abstract noun *<em>ar-ti-</em> derived from the verb-root of <em>ar-ar-iskein</em>, such a noun does in fact survive in Latin as <em>ars</em>, <em>artis</em> ‘craft’.  </p>

# Iliad 4.48

<p>A deeper meaning of the noun <em>dais</em> is revealed here in the wording of Zeus, who says that his <em>bōmos</em> ‘altar’—which is ‘mine’, he adds—has never lacked an equitable <em>dais</em> or ‘portion’ of sacrificial meat whenever Priam and the people of Troy sacrificed to him. This wording reveals that a <em>dais</em> is not only a ‘feast’ but also a sacrifice to the gods. See the comment on I.01.423–425. The division of meat on the occasion of a <em>dais</em> necessarily concerns immortals as well as mortals, and the epithet <em>isē</em> ‘equitable’ referring to the <em>dais</em> or ‘division of portions’ here concerns primarily the god Zeus himself. It looks as if the word <em>dais</em> can evoke a primordial time when immortals and mortals once actually feasted together at one table, as it were. </p>

<p>Epitome from <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5983">Nagy 2015</a>§85. When the hero Pandaros makes his announcement-in-prayer, as expressed by the verb <em>eukhesthai</em>, I.04.119, he says that <em>he will perform an animal sacrifice</em>, I.04.120, in hopes that Apollo, the god to whom he is praying, will grant him <em>what he is wishing for</em>, which is <em>a safe homecoming</em>, I.04.121. But the wish—and therefore the prayer—is a failure, since Pandaros will soon be killed on the battlefield, I.05.290-296. To paraphrase in cognate Latin terms: the <em>vōtum</em> as an ‘announcement-in-prayer’ is a failure here because the same <em>vōtum</em> as a ‘wish-in-prayer’ is not fulfilled: the hero Pandaros will never return home safe and sound.  </p>

We see here a clear example of <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ as a synonym of <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ in Homeric diction. In the present context, the underlying sense of pain conveyed by <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is not only individual, made real by the wounding of the hero Menelaos: it is also collective, since the pain of Menelaos becomes a pain felt by all the Achaeans, who now find themselves on the losing side of the battle because they have lost Menelaos as leader—at least, they have lost him for the moment. The healing of the pain will be up to the warrior-physician Makhaon, son of the ultimate physician Asklepios.  </p>

tags: "taking the hit", therapōn 'attendant, ritual substitute', Eurymedon, Sthenelos, Patroklos, chariot driver/fighter, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 4.227

<p>This is the first Iliadic occurrence of the noun <em>therapōn</em> in the singular; at I.01.321, this noun occurs in the dual; at I.02.110, it occurs in the plural. Besides the surface meaning, ‘attendant’, we can see here some traces of the deeper meaning, ‘ritual substitute’. In Iliadic battle scenes, a chariot driver sometimes “takes the hit,” as it were, for the chariot fighter who ordinarily rides with him on the platform of the war chariot. In “taking the hit,” the chariot driver could die for the chariot fighter, and, in this role, the chariot driver is sometimes described as a <em>therapōn</em> of the chariot fighter. Thus the chariot driver becomes the ‘ritual substitute’ as well as ‘attendant’ of the chariot fighter. Also relevant is the word <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’, the first occcurrence of which in the <em>Iliad</em> is at I.05.231. See Nagy 2015.05.01, 2015.05.08, 2015.05.15, 2015.05.20. Such is the relationship between Achilles as chariot fighter and Patroklos as his premier chariot driver and <em>therapōn</em> in the dual sense of ‘ritual substitute’ and ‘attendant’: see H24H 6§§24–42. In the present context, we see that the hero Eurymedon, named at I.04.228, is described at I.04.227 as the <em>therapōn</em> of Agamemnon. Eurymedon is at this moment taking care of the horse team and chariot of Agamemnon while the king leaves him behind and goes off ‘on foot’, <em>pezos</em>, at I.04.231, in order to harangue the troops. Evidently, Eurymedon is pictured here as the chariot driver of Agamemnon, who is of course the chariot fighter and who has just stepped off his chariot. Potentially, then, Eurymedon as <em>therapōn</em> of Agamemnon is also his ritual substitute. The name Eurymedon recurs at I.08.114, where he is paired with Sthenelos, the chariot driver of Diomedes: the two of them are seen in the act of taking the disabled chariot and horse team of Nestor back to a zone of safety, I.08.116–117. In the act of taking care of Nestor’s horse team, both Sthenelos and Eurymedon are described at I.08.113—and already at I.08.109—as <em>theraponte</em>, which is of course <em>therapōn</em> in the dual. Evidently, Eurymedon is visualized as the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’ of Nestor already at I.08.113, and the context there shows that he is also the designated chariot driver of Nestor: see the comment on Ι.08.076–117. Later on, at I.11.620, Eurymedon is explicitly called the therapōn of Nestor, functioning as the ‘attendant’ of the old hero: at this moment, Eurymedon is taking care of the horse team of Patroklos, who has just driven his chariot to the headquarters of Nestor as the old hero’s guest, I.11.618–622.  </p>

# Iliad 4.368-4.410

<p>Agamemnon starts quarreling with Diomedes, as signaled by <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.04.368. The over-king’s language of blame here is meant to diminish the epic reputation of Diomedes and his chariot-driver Sthenelos, who were prominent heroes in the Theban Wars epic tradition of the past before they became heroes also in the Trojan Wars epic tradition of the present. Diomedes and Sthenelos were main characters in the epic tradition known as the <em>Sons of the Seven against Thebes</em>, or <em>Epigonoi</em>, while their fathers Tydeus and Kapaneus were the main characters in the earlier epic tradition known as the <em>Seven against Thebes</em>. In terms of the blame directed at Diomedes and Sthenelos by Agamemnon, the fathers must have been better than the sons. But the rejoinder of Sthenelos at I.04.404–410 make an opposite claim: the sons were really better than the fathers, since they succeeded in capturing Thebes, whereas the fathers failed. These epic themes are comparable to the Hesiodic reference at <em>Works and Days</em> 156–173 to both the Theban and the Trojan Wars: here too, the burning question is whether a given generation of heroes in the present is superior or inferior to the immediately preceding generation of heroes in the past.  </p>

# Iliad 5

<p>The momentum of the war is spirited, and the fighting mood of the warriors verges on overreaching. An outstanding example is Diomedes, who already owns a glorious past as a conquering hero in the epic tradition known as the <em>Sons of the Seven against Thebes</em> or <em>Epigonoi</em>. Now in the epic present of the <em>Iliad</em> he has a chance to outdo himself, performing deeds so glorious that they would outshine perhaps even the deeds of Achilles, who is now out of the picture. The successes of Diomedes reach the point where he is capable of feats that are superhuman, as when he lifts a rock that even two humans today could not budge—or as when he wounds the god of war himself, Ares, and then, shortly thereafter, the goddess of love and sexuality, Aphrodite. But such momentum is not to last, and the antagonism of Diomedes toward divinities will have its consequences.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Aeneas_and_Diomedes_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Aeneas and Diomedes.” Wenceslaus Hollar (Bohemian, 1607–1677). <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Aeneas_and_Diomedes.jpg">Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>

# Iliad 5.103

<p>This verse shows that the hero Diomedes has a chance to qualify as the ‘best of the Achaeans’, <em>aristos Akhaiōn</em>. In the long run, however, in line with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, Diomedes fails to qualify. Still, his greatest epic moments in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> are traditionally known as his <em>aristeiā</em> (as in the scholia for I.06.448), which I translate here as ‘epic high point’.  </p>

# Iliad 05.059–064

<p>This micro-narrative about Phereklos, a master carpenter who built that ships sailed by Paris=Alexandros for the abduction of Helen, concerns epic events that precede the narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it—but these events are here explained as the real beginning of that same narrative arc. In terms of this micro-narrative, the plot of the <em>Iliad</em>—in the sense that the name <em>Iliad</em> means ‘the story of Ilion [Troy]’—was started or even caused not by the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles, as our <em>Iliad</em> says at the beginning, but rather by an event that preceded that anger. According to this micro-narrative, what really started the Trojan War was the abduction of Helen, which was the <em>kakon</em> ‘bad thing’ that caused all the subsequent bad things, as we read here at I.05.063. And, as predicted at I.05.064, this same event caused the ‘bad thing’ that is about to happen to Phereklos himself. All these events, taken together, thus become part of the overarching plot of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it.</p>

# Iliad 5.059-061

<p>The collocation of <em>tektonos huion</em> (τέκτονος υἱόν) ‘son of the joiner [<em>tektōn</em>]’ at I.05.059 with <em>Harmonideō</em> (Ἁρμονίδεω) ‘son of <em>Harmōn</em>’ at I.05.059 indicates three generations of ‘joiners’, in that Phereklos is a son of a joiner who is in turn a son of a joiner. The grandfather <em>Harmōn</em> has a name that can be reconstructed as a noun *<em>ar-s-mōn</em>, derived from the verb <em>ar-ar-iskein</em> ‘fit together, join together’. And the grandson Phereklos is said at I.05.061 to have ‘built-as-a-carpenter’, <em>tektainesthai</em> (τεκτήνατο), the ships sailed by Paris=Alexandros for the abduction of Helen. This verb <em>tektainein</em> is derived from the noun <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’, which is in turn derived from the verb-root *<em>tek(s)-</em>. No longer attested in Greek, this verb-root *<em>tek(s)-</em> survives in Latin as <em>texō</em>, which can refer to the craft of woodworking, not only the craft of weaving. On verbal art as woodwork, see HC 2§282n. </p>

# Iliad 05.063

<p>The epithet <em>arkhe-kakoi</em> ‘beginning the evil’ at I.05.063 describes the ships in the previous verse, at I.05.062. These ships, as we have seen, were sailed by Paris=Alexandros for the abduction of Helen. The ominous tone of the epithet, and its positioning in the verse immediately following the mention of the ships, is comparable to the ominous tone of the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘accursed’ at I.01.02 in the verse immediately following the mention of the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles in the previous verse, at I.01.01, which is the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>. Even the meaning of the epithet <em>arkhe-kakoi</em> ‘beginning the evil’ at I.05.063 indicates in its own right the beginning of an epic, though of course this beginning does not correspond to the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it. Another point of comparison is the epithet <em>dourateos</em> ‘wooden’ at O.08.493, which is a verse that immediately follows the mention of the <em>hippos</em> ‘horse’ in the previous verse, at O.08.492. Here again we see an ominous mention: this wooden horse, the Trojan Horse, is the marker of yet another potential beginning of an epic narration.</p>

# Iliad 05.440–442

<p>These verses show the fatally serious difficulties encountered in differentiating between mortals and immortals, in the context of similes comparing mortals to immortals by way of words like <em>hoios </em>‘such as’ and <em>enalinkios</em> ‘looking like’; of special relevance are these two words: <em>īsos</em> ‘equal to’ and <em>atalantos</em> ‘equal to’. Here at I.05.440–442, the idea of being <em>īsos</em> ‘equal to’ a divinity is made parallel with the idea of thinking ‘in ways that are equal’, <em>īsa</em>, to divine ways of thinking. These ideas are part of the larger idea, centering on a basic pattern of antagonism between divinity and hero.</p>

# Iliad 5.441/ anchor comment on homoio- 'similiar to, same as'

<p>As the god Apollo says at I.05.441–442, the immortals as a ‘grouping’, <em>phūlon</em>, are different from mortals as a ‘grouping’, <em>phūlon</em>. So, he goes on to say, immortals and mortals are not the same. In the Greek, the ‘grouping’ of immortals and mortals is not <em>homoio</em>-, I.05.441. In terms of this negative context, then, the meaning of <em>homoio</em>- can be interpreted to be ‘the same as’. Meanwhile, the meaning of this same word <em>homoio</em>- in non-negative contexts can be interpreted to be ‘similar to’. In non-negative or let us say positive contexts, <em>homoio</em>- exemplifies the making of comparisons in the form of metaphors and similes. </p><p>In the case of metaphors, Aristotle himself actually uses the word <em>homoio</em>- in his own definition of metaphor, <em>Poetics</em> 1459a5–8:</p><p>πολὺ δὲ μέγιστον τὸ μεταφορικὸν εἶναι. μόνον γὰρ τοῦτο οὔτε παρ’ ἄλλου ἔστι λαβεῖν εὐφυΐας τε σημεῖόν ἐστι· τὸ γὰρ εὖ μεταφέρειν τὸ τὸ ὅμοιον θεωρεῖν ἐστιν</p><p>But the greatest use of words is the use of metaphor [<em>tò metaphorikon</em> ‘that which is transferable’]. This is the only thing that cannot be learned from someone else; and it is also a sign [<em>sēmeion</em>] of a-good-quality-that-is-inborn [<em>euphuia</em>], since the making of good metaphors [<em>eu metapherein</em> ‘good transference’] is the same thing as the contemplation [<em>theōreîn</em>] of what is similar [<em>homoion</em>] to what.</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from MoM 2§§6–7.) Now we turn to similes. This term <em>simile</em> is derived from the neuter form of the Latin adjective <em>similis</em> meaning ‘similar’, from which the English word <em>similar</em> is in turn derived. In English, a <em>simile</em> is signaled by expressions such as <em>like</em> or <em>as</em> or <em>similar to</em>. As for Greek, the primary word for signaling a simile is <em>homoio</em>- in the sense of ‘similar to’. But the etymology of <em>homoio</em>- shows that the meaning ‘similar’ derives from a more basic meaning, ‘same as’. From the standpoint of Indo-European linguistics, the Greek adjective <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) derives from <em>homó</em>- (ὁμό-) ‘same as’, which in turn derives from a prototypical form *<em>somo</em>-, meaning ‘same as’. The English adjective <em>same</em> is derived from this same prototypical form. Another derivative is the Latin adjective <em>similis</em>, meaning ‘same as’ or ‘similar to’. In the usage of both Latin <em>similis</em> and Greek <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-), the same semantic principle applies: for A2 to be similar to A1, it has to be the same as A1 in some respect, which is X. Further, for A2 to be the same as A1, it has to be one with A1 in respect to X. That is because the Indo-European root *<em>som</em>- of *<em>somo</em>- ‘same as’ means ‘one’, as we see in such forms as the Latin adverb <em>semel</em> ‘one time’. And the idea of ‘one’ in words like English <em>same</em> has to do with <em>an act of comparing</em>. When we compare things, what is the ‘same as’ something else in some respect becomes ‘one with’ that something in that respect. That is how a word like Latin <em>similis</em>, deriving from the concept of ‘one’, means ‘similar to’ in the sense of ‘one with’. What is <em>similis</em> ‘similar’ to something else in some respect is ‘one with’ that something in that respect. Similarly in the case of the Greek adjective <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-), it refers to something that is ‘one with’ and therefore ‘the same as’ something else in some respect. And, as we will see in the comment on O.16.172–212, if something else is not the same, then it is <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’, which is the opposite of <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) or ‘the same kind’. As we will also see in that same comment, the extension -<em>io</em>- (-ιο-) of the two adjectives <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’ and <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is parallel to the extension -<em>io</em>- (-ιο-) of the adjectives <em>hoio</em>- (oἷο-) ‘what kind’ and <em>toio</em>- (τοῖο-) ‘that kind’.</p><p>Here we loop back to what the god Apollo says at I.05.441–442: in a negative sense, immortals cannot be the same as mortals. Still, in a special positive sense, mortals can momentarily become the same as immortals <em>when their identities merge in contexts of ritual. Such a special positive sense applies in situations of ritualized antagonism between immortal and mortal</em>. In such situations, the mortal becomes one with the immortal—and can die as a consequence. That is what almost happens to Diomedes, but then he backs off.  </p>

# Iliad 5.696-5.698

<p>At the moment of his fainting or swooning here, the hero’s <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ in the sense of his ‘life’s breath’ is released from his body. But then he ‘comes to’, as it were, and now his life’s breath returns to him. The verb that expresses this idea of revival is <em>ana-pneîn</em> (ἀμπνύνθη)—variant <em>en-pneîn</em> (ἐμπνύνθη)—in the sense of ‘taking a breath’—‘breathing in’. So, the hero’s breath comes back into him, and that is what had left him when his <em>psūkhē</em> in the sense of ‘life’s breath’ had left him. But if we take this same word <em>psūkhē</em> in the sense of a disembodied ‘spirit’, then the spirit that has come back to the hero’s body has not only revived him: it has brought him back to life. Such a mystical sense of revival is most appropriate to the hero Sarpedon when we view a later point in the narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: after he is killed in battle, Sarpedon’s funeral leads to his mystical immortalization.  </p>

# Iliad 5.733-5.747

<p>When the goddess slips out of her <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ and into the <em>khitōn</em> ‘tunic’ that belongs to her father Zeus, there is an intervening moment of nudity. (See MoM 3§1-3§7.) This passage shows (a) the complementarity of the <em>peplos </em>‘robe’ and the <em>khitōn</em> ‘tunic’ worn by Athena and (b) the complementarity of her roles as Athena Polias (goddess of the citadel) and Athena Parthenos (goddess virgin) in the myths and rituals of Athens. This complementarity is re-enacted in the <em>Iliad</em>. (See MoM 3§§9–12.) We see in these verses a linearity that follows a sequence controlled by time in the Homeric reference to the Peplos of Athena. This linearity substitutes for the circular sequence of the Athenians’ charter myth about Athena and the Gigantomachy, which means ‘battle of the gods and giants’. The <em>Iliad</em> here shows a metaphorical substitution of the Trojan War for the Gigantomachy. (On metaphor, see MoM 0§01, 0§1 Extract 0-A.) For the Athenians, Athena is the primary narrator of the Gigantomachy by way of pattern-weaving the narration in her own Peplos as a masterpiece of metonymy. </p>

<p>The hero Kalēsios is identified here at I.06.018 as the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’ of the hero Axulos, who is named at I.06.12–13. In the immediate context, at I.06.018, only the surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘attendant’ is evident. But Kalēsios is not only the <em>therapōn</em> of Axulos: he is also described at I.06.019 as the <em>hup- hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ of Axulos. This description of Kalēsios not only as a <em>therapōn</em> but also as a <em>hup- hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ points to the deeper meaning, ‘ritual substitute’, for <em>therapōn</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 6.286-6.311

<p>The general hostility of the divinity Athena toward the Trojans in this narrative sequence, despite the fact that the women of Troy are shown here in the act of formally worshipping her as the divine protector of their citadel, can be correlated with a pattern of personal hostility felt by the goddess toward Hector as a hero who aspires to some of the same roles that Athena herself exemplifies. In the case of the verses here, I.06.286–311, this goddess is worshipped in her role as <em>protector of citadels under siege</em>: that is why Theano as high priestess of Troy prays to Athena by invoking her as <em>erusi-ptolis</em> ‘protector of the citadel [<em>p(t)olis</em>]’ at I.06.305. Like the goddess, Hector can be seen as an exponent of defensive tactics in protecting a citadel from sieges: as we saw in the comment on I.05.473–474, even his name fits his intended role as the protector of the citadel of Troy, since <em>Hék-tōr</em> is an agent noun derived from the verb <em>ekhein</em> ‘hold’ in the specialized sense of ‘uphold’ or ‘protect’ or ‘guard’. In the context of I.05.473–474, the expected role of Hector is <em>to protect the city of Troy</em>, and the direct object of <em>ekhein</em> ‘uphold, protect, guard’ at I.05.473 is <em>polis</em> ‘city, citadel’, referring to Troy. But the tragedy is, Hector will fail in the role of protecting Troy, since he will abandon strategies of defending the city and will opt instead for staying on the offensive against an enemy that will ultimately capture Troy. And a key to his failure, as we will see in the course of the macro-narrative, is the fact that Athena herself will delude Hector into staying on the offensive until it is too late for him to revert to a defensive role. Such a pattern of antagonism between immortal and mortal, it can be argued, derives from the ideologies of hero cult.  </p>

<p>Hecuba goes ahead and does what she has been told to do, which is, to offer a <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ for Athena as the goddess of the citadel of Troy. The repetition of ritual wording in the sequence of three passages—from I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296—will culminate in a master plan, as it were, for performing the ritual of presenting the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Troy. What has just been described as a “repetition,” however, needs to be explained further (HPC 268): </p><p>In this sequence of three passages [I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296], we see three consecutive restatements of the same ritual act. I say <em>three restatements</em> instead of <em>one statement and two restatements</em> because none of the three passages is basic, from the standpoint of traditional formulaic diction. Not one of the three passages is formulaically predictable on the basis of the other two passages. To put it another way, the variation that we find in the three passages shows that none of the three forms is formally prior to the other two. What priorities we find are purely a function of the narration, not of any chronological order in the composition of the three passages. In terms of oral poetics, such variation is a display of virtuosity in the art of composition in performance.  </p>

# Iliad 6.294

<p>The noun <em>poikilma</em> at I.06.294 refers to ‘pattern-weaving’ in a concrete and not an abstract sense: so, ‘pattern-woven thing’. The ‘pattern-woven things’ here are the <em>peploi</em> ‘robes’ described by the adjective <em>pan-poikilo</em>- ‘completely pattern-woven’ at I.06.289. These words <em>pan-poikilos </em>and <em>poikilma</em>, which refer to the peplos ‘robe’ that is being chosen for Athena, convey not only the general idea of <em>variation</em>, which is relevant to the variability of the wording that describes the ritual of presenting the <em>peplos</em> to Athena. More than that, they convey also the specific idea of pattern-weaving a picture into a fabric. Such a picture was pattern-woven into the Panathenaic Peplos of Athena. See the comment on I.05.734–735. The adjective <em>pan-poikilos</em> ‘completely pattern-woven’ is the epithet of the Panathenaic Peplos (scholia for Aristophanes <em>Birds</em> 827), and the noun <em>poikilma</em> designates the pattern-weaving of the charter myth of the Gigantomachy into the Panathenaic Peplos (Plato <em>Euthyphro</em> 6b-c).  </p>

# Iliad 6.297-310

<p>With each repetition of the wording for the presentation of the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Troy—from I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296—the master plan seems to fit more and more the ritual of presenting a pattern-woven <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Athens at the Athenian festival of the Panathenaia. On the Panathenaic Peplos, see again the comment on I.05.734–735; see also HPC 270. Looking back at the entire narrative sequence as analyzed here—I.06.090–093, I.06.271–273, I.06.286–296, I.06.297–310—I highlight two most salient visual details at Ι.06.297, namely, the citadel or acropolis of Troy and the temple on top of that acropolis. These two details correspond to the two most visible details distinguishing the city of Athens from most other cities. At work here is a process I describe as <em>split referencing</em>. The reference is split between Troy and Athens. The referent is both the prehistorical citadel of Troy and the historical citadel or acropolis of Athens. As for the narrative here at I.06.286-311 about the presentation of the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena, the <em>peplos</em> to be chosen is highlighted as the biggest of all the <em>peploi</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271, I.06.294). It is the <em>peplos</em> that is most ‘beautiful’ or <em>kalon</em> (I.06.294), with the most ‘pleasurable beauty’ or <em>kharis</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271). The size and the beauty of the fabric evoke a vision of the quadrennial Panathenaic Peplos, which is notionally the biggest and most beautiful of all imaginable <em>peploi</em>. As for the association of the word <em>kharis</em> ‘pleasurable beauty’ with the fabric, it is appropriate not only to the <em>peplos</em> that is being described but also to the medium that describes the <em>peplos</em>. That medium is Homeric poetry as performed at the quadrennial festival of the Panathenaia. The concept of <em>kharis</em> conveys the charisma of Homeric poetry as described by Homeric poetry. In terms of this description, the <em>peplos</em> in this narrative, I.06.286-311, can be seen as a metaphor for epic as performed at the Panathenaia. This epic is notionally the biggest and the most beautiful of all epics. Like the <em>peplos</em> that is being offered by the women to Athena, this epic as performed at the Panathenaia has more <em>kharis</em> than all other epics.  </p>

# Iliad 6.402-403

<p>The first name for the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. The meaning of this “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) is relevant to the heroic function of the father as <em>guarding a citadel from sieges</em>. See the comment on I.22.506–507. The second name for the son of Hector, Scamandrius [<em>Skamandrios</em>], I.06.402, derives from a rival Aeolian tradition, here undermined by the prevailing Ionian tradition of the <em>Iliad</em> (HPC 203–205). According to this rival tradition, as we read in Euripides <em>Andromache</em> 224 (together with the scholia for that verse), Scamandrius was a bastard son of Hector who survived the Trojan War, to be distinguished from the legitimate son of Hector and Andromache, Astyanax, who tragically failed to survive. According to Aeolian traditions, Scamandrius not only survived the Trojan War but later became king of Troy (scholia T for I.24.735). By contrast, according to the dominantly Ionian traditions as represented by the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, Scamandrius could not have survived if he was the same child as Astyanax, which is what we read here at I.06.402–403. So, the version as we have it kills off the potentially surviving half-brother.  </p>

tags: lament, sorrows of Andromache, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 6.407-6.439/ anchor comment on: ancient Greek lament

<p>Here at I.06.407–439, the wording of Andromache in addressing her departing husband Hector, whom she will never again see alive, is not just a speech expressing her sorrows: it is also, in terms of Homeric representation, a song of lament. What now follows is a general introduction to what is meant here. Ancient Greek lament is a deeply ritualized ritual practice, and there are survivals of this practice even to this day in some Greek-speaking communities. For background on the continuities and the discontinuities of this practice, I recommend the book by Margaret Alexiou, <em>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition</em> (1974). Aside from the specific example of ancient Greek laments, there are many other examples of such a practice to be found in a wide variety of societies throughout the world. In general, lament is understood to mean the formal expression of the emotion that we know as sadness—or, to say it more formally, <em>sorrow</em>. In Homeric diction, the primary words that are used for referring to sorrow are <em>akhos</em> or <em>penthos</em>, both of which I ordinarily translate as ‘grief’. In the case of ancient Greek society as also in many other cases, however, the general definition of lament as an expression of sorrow is insufficient. A lament can be more than just an expression of some inner sorrow by way of outward signs like crying. The outward signs can be formalized by way of <em>crying</em> and <em>verbalizing</em> at the same time. And the act of verbalizing can even become an act of <em>singing</em>, as in the case of ancient Greek traditions. In terms of these traditions, the act of lamenting is an act of singing while crying and crying while singing. And this kind of singing <em>is</em> crying; this kind of crying <em>is</em> singing. The physical aspects of crying are all integrated into the singing: the flow of tears, the choking of the voice, the convulsions of the body, and so on, are all part of the singing. And such physical aspects are also formalized into a kinetic system of stylized movements—to be seen as a kind of <em>dancing</em> that is integrated with the <em>singing</em>. On such a kinetic aspect of lament, see further the comment on I.18.051–060.  </p>

# Iliad 6.407–439/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 1

<p>In the Iliad, Andromache is represented as singing three songs of lament for Hector. Each one of these three laments is quoted, as it were, by the Master Narrator, and each one of the quotations corresponds morphologically to a genuine song of lament as sung by a lamenting woman. It must be emphasized, however, that the laments that we see being quoted by the epic of Homeric poety do not represent the actual meter of lament as sung in real laments. The genre of epic regularly uses its own meter, which is the dactylic hexameter, in representing other genres that it quotes, including unmetrical genres (Martin 1989:12–42; also pp. 87–88, specifically on lament). But the morphology of laments quoted by epic still follows the rules of lament. On this point about the morphology of lament, see further the comment on I.19.282–302. In other words, each quotation of each one of the three laments performed by Andromache is meant to be heard as a re-enactment, performed by the Master Narrator, of a genuine song of lament. In the first lament, as quoted by the Master Narrator here at I.06.407–439, Andromache is already lamenting the death of Hector before he is even dead. As for the second lament, at I.22.477–514, Andromache will sing it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for the third lament, at I.24.725–745, Andromache will sing it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. The first two laments can be seen as previews, as it were, of the more formal third lament. But it must be kept in mind that the traditions of lamentation can allow for the spontaneous singing of a lament as an instant response to a deep loss that has just happened—or even as a premonition of a future loss that has yet to happen. On this point about premonition, there are further comments in H24H 3§§23–24; see also Nagy 2015.06.17.  </p>

# Iliad 7

<p>Up to now, Diomedes has been the hero who comes closest to Achilles in competing for the title ‘best of the Achaeans’. Here in Rhapsody 7, however, the focus shifts to Ajax, who responds to the challenge of Hector to fight in a duel the one hero among all the Achaeans who is truly the ‘best of the Achaeans’. As we know from the overall references to Ajax in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, this hero is considered to be the second-best of the Achaeans in both epics. So, it does not bode well for Hector that, in his duel with Ajax, he cannot succeed beyond fighting such a hero to a draw. If Hector can do no better than fight to a draw the second-best of the Achaeans, he is surely doomed when the time comes for him to face the very best of the Achaeans in Rhapsody 22.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2010EG3723_jpg_l.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Hector and Ajax separated by heralds, pen and ink drawing by John Flaxman, 1790’s <a href="http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1009262/hector-and-ajax-separated-by-drawing-flaxman-john/">Victoria and Albert Museum</a></p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, elliptic plural/dual, hippoi/hippō as meaning not ‘horses’ but ‘chariot’

# Iliad 7.15-7.17

<p>The hero Dexiades is described at I.07.015 by way of the participle <em>epi-almenos</em> meaning ‘one who leaps on’, and the preverb <em>epi</em>- ‘on’ of the participle takes as its object the noun <em>hippoi</em> ‘horses’ in the genitive case. But the meaning of this combination is not ‘one who leaps on horses’ but rather ‘one who leaps on the chariot drawn by horses’. That, is, <em>hippoi</em> in such a context is an elliptic plural referring not only to the two horses that conventionally draw a chariot in Homeric diction but to the chariot drawn by the two horses. In the action being described here, the same hero Dexiades is mortally wounded at I.07.13 by a spear-throw that hits him and knocks him out of the chariot, and here the preposition <em>ex</em> ‘out of’ in combination with the noun <em>hippoi</em> ‘horses’ as its grammatical object in the genitive case means that the hero has been knocked off the platform of the chariot, falling out of the chariot and landing on the ground with a mighty thud. In short, then, <em>epi</em> + the genitive of <em>hippoi</em> at I.07.11 means ‘on the chariot’, with reference to standing on the platform of a chariot, while <em>ex</em> + the genitive of <em>hippoi</em> at I.07.13 means ‘out of the chariot’, with reference to getting knocked out of the chariot while standing on the platform.  </p>

# Iliad 7.15–17/ anchor comment on: special ways of saying 'chariot'

<p>In general, the noun <em>hippoi</em>/<em>hippō</em> as elliptic plural/dual means not ‘horses’ but ‘chariot’ when this noun functions as a grammatical object in the genitive (G) or dative (D) or accusative (A) case in combination with prepositions or preverbs referring to such situations as <em>standing on the platform of a chariot</em>  (<em>epi</em>+G, <em>epi</em>+D) or <em>leaping down from the platform</em> (<em>apo</em>+G, <em>kata</em>+G) or <em>leaping up onto the platform </em>(<em>epi</em>+G, <em>eis</em>+A) or <em>getting knocked off and falling down from the platform</em> (<em>ek</em>+G, <em>kata</em>+G). What follows is a list showing these occurrences of the word <em>hippoi</em>/<em>hippō</em> with the elliptic meaning of ‘chariot’ but not showing other occurrences where the ellipsis is canceled by way of correlating this word with other words like <em>harma</em> and <em>diphros</em>, both of which have the non-elliptic meaning of ‘chariot’. Here, then, are occurrences showing only <em>hippoi</em>/<em>hippō</em> with the elliptic meaning of ‘chariot’ and without an explicit mention of <em>harma</em> ‘chariot’ or <em>diphros</em> ‘chariot’: I.03.265 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.04.500 (<em>para</em>+G), I.05.013 (<em>apo</em>+G/D), I.05.019 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.05.046 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.05.111 (<em>kata</em>+G), I.05.163 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.05.227 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.05.249 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.05.255 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.05.321 (<em>epi</em>+A), I.05.328 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.05.835 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.06.232 (<em>kata</em>+G), I.07.013 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.07.015 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.07.240 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.08.127 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.08.492 (<em>ek</em>+<em>apo</em>+G), I.10.330 (<em>epi</em>+D), I.10.513 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.10.529 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.11.094 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.11.109 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.11.143 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.11.179 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.11.192 (<em>eis</em>+A), I.11.207 (<em>eis</em>+A), I.11.320 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.11.423 (<em>kata</em>+G), I.12.082 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.14.435 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.15.386 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.15.447 (<em>kata</em>+A), I.16.343 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.16.733 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.16.749 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.16.755 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.17.460 (<em>epi</em>+D), I.17.40 (<em>apo</em>+G), I.17.501 (<em>epi</em>+A), I.18.531 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.19.396 (<em>epi</em>+G/D), I.20.401 (<em>kata</em>+G), I.20.461 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.24.051 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.24.356 (<em>epi</em>+G), I.24.459 (<em>ek</em>+G), I.24.469 (<em>ek</em>+G). These elliptic usages compensate, in part, for the fact that the Mycenaean word for ‘chariot’, <em>hikkʷiā</em> (spelled i-qi-ja in the Linear B tablets), is missing in Homeric diction, where it would be pronounced *<em>hippiā</em>. The metrical shape of such a form, long-short-long, would be incompatible with the rhythmical contour of the dactylic hexameter, which generally does not tolerate forms that have such a shape. But the survival of elliptic plural/dual <em>hippoi</em>/<em>hippō</em> is not necessarily a substitution for the missing *<em>hippiā</em>, nor is it justified to assume that such elliptic forms represent some kind of deformity in Homeric diction. </p>

<p>The divinities Athena and Apollo are not only supporting the Achaeans and the Trojans respectively. They are also opposing the Trojans and the Achaeans respectively. Even more than that, these divinities are also personally antagonistic toward individual heroes: Athena opposes Hector while Apollo opposes Achilles. In this passage, the antagonism between Athena and Hector is particularly evident. When the seer Helenos at I.07.047 addresses his brother Hector by describing him as comparable to the god Zeus himself with respect to Hector’s qualities of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, the wording of this description is a direct affront to the divinity Athena, who is the goddess of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ personified.  </p>

# Iliad 7.063-064

<p>The noun <em>phríx</em> ‘shuddering’, which conveys the subjectivized feeling of an observer who shudders when he looks at the sea being stirred up by the West Wind named Zephyros while feeling the sudden blast of the wind, is related not only formally but even thematically to the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of <em>Phríxos</em>, a hero who escaped the dangers of the <em>pontos</em> ‘[sea-] crossing’ that is the Hellespont, as we read in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 4.160–161. The wording of Pindar goes on to say there that Phríxos was ‘saved’, <em>saōthē</em>, because he was carried to safety by the ram with the golden fleece. Before the occurrence of the name Zephyros here at I.07.063, the same name for the West Wind has occurred in previous similes: I.02.147, I.04.276, 04.423. In a forthcoming simile showing the sea stirred up by the North Wind named Boreas together with the West Wind named Zephyros, I.09.004–008, the subjective feeling of fear that overcomes the observer is described as <em>kruoeis</em> ‘chilling’, I.09.002. So, the observer shudders at the chilling power of the storm at sea. The stormy combination of Boreas and Zephyros is described as stirring up the <em>pontos</em> ‘sea[-crossing]’ also at I.23.230, and this sea, described there as ‘Thracian’, is to be equated with the Hellespont.  </p>

Hector boasts that he will kill this fighter, still to be named, who will then be entombed inside a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ overlooking the Hellespont, I.07.086, and thus Hector will have a <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that is eternal, I.07.091. The irony here is that the fighter still to be named will be the winner of a future duel with Hector. That fighter will be Achilles, and the eternal <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ will be primarily his. On the other hand, Hector’s wording is on the mark when he says at I.07.086 that the hero who is ‘best of the Achaeans’ will be entombed inside a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ overlooking the Hellespont. And that hero will be Achilles.  </p>

# Iliad 7.092–169

<p>The Achaeans, faced with Hector’s challenge, hesitate, I.07.092–093. Their hesitation seems to indicate that not one of them is really the ‘best of the Achaeans’. Finally, Menelaos is first to volunteer for a one-on-one duel with Hector, I.07.094–103. An absence of volunteers, Menelaos knows, would be <em>aklees</em> ‘a thing without glory [<em>kleos</em>]’, I.07.100. It seems of course fitting for him to be the first, since his grievance against the Trojans over the abduction of Helen is primary, but the problem is that all the Achaean chieftains are aware of his inferiority to Hector, I.07.106, and so, fearing for his life, they restrain him from arming himself for a duel. Even the Master Narrator says outright that Hector was superior to Menelaos, I.07.104–105. Then Nestor goads the chieftains to take up the challenge of Hector, I.07.123–161, and his goading now prompts nine of these chieftains to volunteer, I.07.161–169: they are Agamemnon, Diomedes, the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus and Meriones, Eurypylos, Thoas, and Odysseus. It is significant that Nestor’s words refer to these nine chieftains as <em>aristēes Panakhaiōn</em>, I.07.159. For a translation of this expression, the singular form <em>aristeus</em> of plural <em>aristēes</em> first needs to be correlated with the verb <em>aristeuein</em>, which can be translated as ‘strive to be the best, to be <em>aristos</em>’, as at Ι.06.208 and I.11.784. In the second of these two passages, I find it most significant that the referent is significantly Achilles himself. An <em>aristeus</em>, then, is a man who strives to be the best, <em>aristos</em>. Correspondingly, the expression <em>aristēes Panakhaiōn</em> at I.07.159 must refer to ‘men who strive to be the best of all the Achaeans’.  </p>

# Iliad 7.336–343

<p>Nestor, in speaking to the assembled Achaeans, prescribes that they build a Wall for the purpose of protecting both them and their ships from the attacks of the Trojans. This purpose is spelled out at I.07.338. What Nestor prescribes for the Achaeans to accomplish here at I.07.336–343 is then actually accomplished by them, as described at I.07.434–442, where the purpose of protecting both the Achaeans and their ships is restated, I.07.437. The details of the prescription and of the description supplement each other. For example, an important detail that is absent in the prescription is supplemented in the description: the word <em>teikhos</em> ‘wall’, referring to the overall structure that the Achaeans are building, is absent in the prescription, I.07.337, but this word is present in the description, I.07.436. Both in the prescription and in the description, at I.07.336–338 and at I.07.435–437 respectively, the Wall is linked to the collective tomb that the Achaeans are to build for their war dead: this tomb is located right next to the pyre where the bodies of the dead are cremated, I.07.337 and I.07.436.  </p>

# Iliad 07.433–465

<p>Within these verses I.07.433–465 is a description of the building of the Achaean Wall at I.07.434–442 that matches the prescription given by Nestor at I.07.336–343. While the Wall is being built, I.07.434–442, the gods are watching, I.07.443–444, and Poseidon makes a speech to Zeus, I.445–453, indicating that this Achaean project is against his will and, presumably, against the will of Apollo. Poseidon is concerned that the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ of the Achaean Wall, I.07.451, will detract from the corresponding glory of the Trojan Wall that had been built by him together with Apollo for Laomedon, who had been king of Troy before Priam, I.07.452–453. Zeus responds with reassurances, I.07.454–464, reaffirming the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ that belongs to Poseidon, I.07.458 (σὸν …κλέος). In other words, Poseidon and Apollo will never lose the epic glory that is theirs because they built the Wall of Troy. And Zeus then utters a prophecy about the <em>teikhos</em> ‘wall’ of the Achaeans, I.07.461: it will be destroyed once the Achaeans leave the Trojan landscape, I.07.459–464. So the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ of the Achaean Wall, as signaled in the wording of Poseidon at I.07.451, will not destroy the <em>kleos</em> or epic ‘glory’ that is owed to Poseidon and to Apollo for their building of the Trojan Wall. In terms of this formulation made by Zeus, it is not clear whether the Trojan Wall will later be utterly destroyed or simply damaged when the Achaeans finally conquer Troy. Such a distinction is relevant to a claim made in historical times by the inhabitants of New Ilion, which was in fact the Old Ilion, otherwise known simply as Troy: the people of Ilion maintained that their Wall had not been completely destroyed by the Achaeans in the Trojan War and that their city, despite all the destruction, had never been left completely abandoned. This claim is documented but rejected by Strabo 13.1.40 C599. See Point 7 of the anchor comment at I.09.328–333 about efforts of Aeolians to possess ancient Troy and its environs in the historical period.</p>

# Iliad 08.002

<p>This compound noun <em>terpi-kéraunos</em>, interpreted here as ‘he whose bolt strikes’, is an epithet that applies exclusively to Zeus: a parallel epithet, also applied exclusively to Zeus, is the compound noun <em>argi-kéraunos</em> at Ι.19.121, I.20.016, I.22.178, which can be interpreted to mean ‘he whose bolt shines’ (<em>Greek Mythology and Poetics </em>(<em>GMP</em>) 195). Both epithets fit Zeus in his role as a thunder-god. The second part of both compounds <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> and <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly derived from <em>keraunós</em> ‘thunder’, and the first part of <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly related to <em>arg</em>‑<em>ós</em> (earlier *<em>argr</em>‑<em>ós</em>) ‘shining, speeding’, but the first part of <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> seems at first unclear. Related forms in other Indo-European languages, however, help elucidate the meaning of <em>terpi</em>‑ as combined with <em>keraunós</em>. In the case of <em>keraunós</em>, we find in the Baltic and Slavic branches of Indo-European the parallel forms <em>perkūnas</em> and <em>perunŭ</em> respectively, both of which are nouns meaning ‘thunder’ and/or ‘god of thunder’. Although the Greek and the Baltic/Slavic roots here, *<em>kerh₂(u̯)</em>‑ and *<em>per(kʷ)</em>‑ respectively, are different in form, they are parallel in meaning, ‘strike’, and the morphology of their suffixation is also parallel. (<em>GMP</em> 194–195). As for the <em>terpi</em>‑ of <em>terpi</em>‑<em>kéraunos</em>, we find a comparable form in the Italic branch of Indo-European: it is the Latin noun <em>quercus</em>, meaning ‘oak tree’. This form, it can be argued, refers to the defining sacred moment when a thunderbolt strikes an oak tree: here the root of the <em>u</em>-stem noun <em>quercus</em>, from *<em>perkʷu‑</em>, is *<em>perkʷ‑</em>, meaning ‘strike’ (<em>GMP</em> 186). So, <em>terpi‑kéraunos</em> can be derived from *<em>kʷerpi-kéraunos</em> via metathesis from *<em>perkʷi-kéraunos</em>.</p>

# Iliad 8.78–8.117

<p>(What follows is a general commentary on these verses; what follows after that is an anchor comment on Nestor’s entanglement and the poetics of evocation) </p><p>Seeing the lightning sent by Zeus, I.08.076, the Achaean chieftains are now thunderstruck with fear, I.08.076–077. Mentioned by name at I.08.078–079 as those chieftains who now retreat in terror are Idomeneus, Agamemnon, and the two Ajaxes. Only Nestor, it is said, does not retreat, though not because he does not want to: he simply cannot retreat because his chariot has been immobilized, I.08.080-086. The trace horse of Nestor’s chariot team of three horses has been shot dead by Paris and has fallen down violently to the ground, I.08.080-086. The old hero, drawing his sword, is now struggling to cut himself loose from the <em>parēoriai</em> ‘traces’ that were connected to the fallen horse and that have now entangled the chariot team, I.08.087–088. This trace horse, not named, is analogous to the trace horse of Achilles, named Pedasos, who is killed at a much later point in the <em>Iliad</em>, in a scene of chariot fighting that takes place at I.16.466–476. In that scene, a spear throw by Sarpedon in the course of his chariot fight with Patroklos hits Pedasos instead of Patroklos, I.16.466–468. At I.16.471 and at I.16.474, the narrative there refers to Pedasos explicitly as the <em>parēoros</em> ‘trace horse’ of a three-horse chariot team. As a trace horse, Pedasos is not attached to the yoke that attaches the other two horses to the chariot. This distinction is made clear at a slightly earlier moment, I.16.145–154, leading up to the chariot fight. At this moment, the premier chariot driver of Achilles, Automedon, is harnessing for Patroklos the war chariot of Achilles. On this chariot, Automedon and Patroklos will be riding off together as chariot rider and chariot fighter respectively. At this slightly earlier moment, we see that there are two immortal horses of Achilles, Xanthos and Balios, who are attached to the yoke of the chariot, I.16.148–149, while the mortal trace horse Pedasos is simply connected to the <em>parēoriai</em> ‘traces’, I.16.152. (At this same moment, I.16.153, a significant detail is added about Pedasos: this horse had been captured once upon a time by Achilles when that hero killed the horse’s former owner, who was Eëtion the father of Andromache.) Then, at I.16.466–469, when Pedasos is killed by the spear-throw of Sarpedon and falls violently to the ground, the traces of this trace horse get entangled in the reins connected to the other two horses, I.16.470–471, and Automedon the chariot driver must free himself from the entanglement by drawing his sword and cutting the traces, thus severing the ties to the dead trace horse, Ι.16.472–475. Having noted what will happen in this future action, we now return to the present, I.08.087–088: so, what happens to Nestor as he struggles to cut himself loose from his entanglement? Well, meanwhile, the old hero’s predicament has been spotted by Hector, who is now driving his own chariot at high speed toward Nestor, I.08.088–090, intending to attack him before Nestor can disentangle himself from his disabled chariot. As Hector charges ahead, he is holding on to the reins of his own chariot horses, since he is described at I.08.090 as the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ for the moment, or, to translate the word more literally, as ‘the one who holds on to the reins’. For the moment, then, it is the chariot fighter Hector and not his chariot driver who is here taking the initiative of attempting a high-speed attack on Nestor. Hector is thus taking over here from his own chariot driver, who as we will see later is a hero named Eniopeus and who at this precise moment must be standing next to Hector on the platform of the speeding chariot—but not driving the vehicle himself. This detail about Hector as the momentary chariot driver helps explain what happens later on. Eventually, Hector’s driver Eniopeus will be killed while apparently still standing on the chariot platform: it will happen at I.08.119–124, where Diomedes throws his spear at Hector but hits Eniopeus instead, who dies instantly and falls out of the chariot. In that context, we will see that Eniopeus is now and only now described explicitly as the <em>hēni-okho</em>s ‘chariot driver’, I.08.119. There is an irony here. If Eniopeus and not Hector had been driving the chariot when Diomedes threw his spear, it could have been Hector who got hit and killed. Having noted once again what will happen in the future action, we now return to the present. The Master Narrator goes on to say at I.08.090 that the entanglement of the old hero Nestor would surely have resulted in his death at the hands of Hector—had it not been for the intervention of the young hero Diomedes, I.08.091. Urging Nestor to leave behind his disabled chariot, Diomedes offers him an invitation: let the two heroes ride together on the new chariot of Diomedes and let them now counterattack Hector, I.08.092–112. And let the two <em>theraponte</em> ‘attendants’ meanwhile take away the horses and the chariot of Nestor, taking them back to a zone of safety, I.08.109. The old hero agrees to the invitation, I.08.112. So, the two ‘attendants’ now proceed to take away the chariot team of Nestor, I.08.113, and these two figures are identified here as Sthenelos, chariot driver of Diomedes, and Eurymedon, chariot driver of Nestor, I.08.114. Meanwhile the old hero Nestor joins Diomedes, mounting the platform of the young hero’s chariot. And then he even takes the reins of the chariot of Diomedes in hand and drives the chariot himself, I.08.116–117. So, for the moment, Nestor takes over from Sthenelos as the designated charioteer of Diomedes. </p>

# Iliad 8.078–117/ anchor comment on: Nestor's entanglement and the poetics of evocation

<p>This whole epic narrative about Nestor’s entanglement and his rescue by Diomedes is evocative of another epic narrative where the old hero gets entangled—and gets rescued this time by another young hero, his own son Antilokhos, from the onslaught of another enemy, the chariot fighter Memnon. In this other narrative, however, the son will die in the act of rescuing the father. He will be killed by Memnon. There is a reference to this other epic narrative in a song of Pindar, <em>Pythian</em> 6.28–42. The death of Antilokhos was also narrated in a part of the epic Cycle, the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, as we read in the plot-summary of Proclus p. 106 lines 4-6 (ed. Allen 1912). On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas. And there is a passing reference to the death of Antilokhos in O.04.186–188. That said, it is important to add a clarification: to say that the Iliadic narrative about an entanglement experienced by Nestor is <em>evocative</em> of another epic narrative as found in the epic Cycle is not to say that the <em>Iliad</em> is referring to a pre-existing text. In poetic traditions that stem from an evolving process of recomposition-in-performance, as in the case of Homeric poetry, any act of referencing needs to be viewed in terms of the historical context for any given performance. What can work as a reference in one context may not work so well—or work at all— in some other context. A performance that follows one epic version can refer—however indirectly—to another epic version, but only if those who hear the performance are expected to know both versions. Referencing can be direct, as when Sthenelos the chariot driver of Diomedes refers at I.02.119–130 to the role of these two heroes in the epic traditions of the Epigonoi, that is, The Sons-of-the-Seven-against Thebes. Or referencing can be indirect, as is the case here. The narrative about the entanglement of Nestor and his rescue by Diomedes is sure to have a special effect on those who already know of another narrative about a later entanglement of Nestor that leads to tragic consequences. So, the term <em>evocation</em> suits such indirect referencing. Viewed in this light, <em>evocation</em> in Homeric poetry can be defined simply as <em>a reference made not directly but only indirectly from one traditional context to another</em>. For another evocation of the epic moment when Nestor’s chariot gets entangled and his son Antilokhos gets killed in an effort to save the old hero, see the comment on I.09.057–058.  </p>

<p>Diomedes is speaking to Nestor, saying that the old hero’s chariot driver, unnamed here, has lost his energy and usefulness. Diomedes refers to this driver here at I.01.321 as Nestor’s <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’. In the immediate context, only the surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘attendant’ is evident. But this particular attendant is not only the <em>therapōn</em> of Nestor: in the overall context of I.08.076–117, it is also evident that this <em>therapōn</em> is in fact the designated chariot driver of Nestor, though the specific word hēni-okhos ‘chariot driver’ is not used here. The name of this driver is Eurymedon, as we see at I.08.114. He may or may not be the same hero Eurymedon as at I.04.227.  </p>

# Iliad 8.119

<p>The hero Eniopeus son of Thebaios is here both the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ and the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Hector. When Diomedes throws his spear at Hector, it is Eniopeus who “takes the hit” instead, I.08.119–124. This detail is relevant to the fact, highlighted from the start, that Eniopeus is both the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ and the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Hector, I.08.119. In this context, then, the deeper meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’ is overt. The narrative goes on to say that Hector is deeply saddened by the death of his chariot driver, but he leaves the corpse of Eniopeus where that hero fell: instead of trying to rescue the corpse, Hector decides to fight on and immediately proceeds to select a new chariot driver, I.08.124–129, whose name is Arkheptolemos, I.08.128.  </p>

Besides Hector, as here at I.08.215 another hero who will be pointedly described as ‘equal to Ares’ is Patroklos. Besides sharing such an epithet, Hector and Patroklos will also be sharing the armor of Achilles: first it is Patroklos who wears this armor when he goes off to fight as a substitute for Achilles; and then Hector will wear it after he kills Patroklos.  </p>

# Iliad 8.228-235

<p>By blaming or insulting his fellow Achaeans for not daring to stand up to the onslaught of Hector, Agamemnon is goading them into action. His insulting words recall a scene that took place in their collective epic past, on the island of Lemnos, where the Achaeans were competitively boasting about the exploits they will perform in the future when they fight in the Trojan War. The idea of ‘boasting’ is conveyed by the noun <em>eukhōlē</em>, which is derived from <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’. As we already saw at I.01.091, what is at stake when an Achaean hero boasts in the <em>Iliad</em> centers on the all-important question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The noun <em>eukhōlai</em> ‘boastings’ in the plural here at I.08.229 indicates a distributive action: the Achaeans were boasting not as a group but individually and competitively. The object of such competition and dispute would have been: to show who is the <em>aristos</em> ‘best’ of them all. When Agamemnon says at I.08.229 ‘we were saying that we were best [<em>aristoi</em>]’, the plural construction here is distributive in meaning: ‘each one of us was saying that he was the best [<em>aristos</em>]’. We see in this scene of a past event at Lemnos an epic precedent for what is ongoing in the present time of the Trojan War as narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>. Just as there was a dispute at Lemnos, there is a dispute ongoing in the <em>Iliad</em> about that all-important question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? A most relevant detail in the story about the dispute at Lemnos is the fact that the context for the quarreling that took place at that time over the same question, who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’, was a feast where meat was being distributed, I.08.231. So the setting for the quarrel was an event that is elsewhere called a <em>dais</em>, to be defined as ‘feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’ in Homeric diction. As we saw in the comment for I.01.423–425, a <em>dais</em> is a feast where meat is distributed, and this meat comes from the sacrifice of a sacrificial animal. Thus the act of sacrifice converts the feast of humans into a notional feast of the gods. This notion, ‘feast of the gods’, is made explicit in the “micro-Iliad” of O.8.072–083, which is the First Song of Demodokos. At O.08.076, the setting is described this way: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a sumptuous feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. So, what is happening at this feast? There is a dispute going on (δηρίσαντο at Ο.08.076), and the dispute is called a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075. The disputants are Odysseus and Achilles, who are described at O.08.078 as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. In terms of such a dispute in the context of a feast, each one of the two heroes would be claiming to be the ‘best of the Achaeans’. Similarly in the context of the feast at Lemnos as narrated by Agamemnon, each one of the heroes attending would be making such a claim.  </p>

# Iliad 9.001–003/ anchor comment on: a Rhapsody as one of 24 units of performance

<p>The beginning of Rhapsody 9 picks up where Rhapsody 8 ended. There is a brief reference at I.09.001 to the ending of Rhapsody 8. Then, in the rest of the verse at I.09.001 and continuing into I.09.002–003 there is a transition into the narrative as it now resumes. A fitting term for this sort of transition is <em>rhapsodic sequencing</em>. Here as elsewhere, the transition of the narrative from one rhapsody to the next shows that each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Iliad</em>—and each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Odyssey</em>—is a distinct unit of performance. In the classical period of Athens, as we see in Plato’s <em>Ion</em>, professional performers of Homeric rhapsodies were known as <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’. The term <em>rhapsōidiā</em>, translated in this comment as ‘rhapsody’, originates from the traditions of <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’ who performed poetry in competitive relay with other rhapsodes. Accordingly, the <em>rhapsōidiai</em> ‘rhapsodies’ of Homeric poetry can be seen as units of relay performance. </p>

# Iliad 9.002

<p>The name <em>Phúza</em>, which is a personification of <em>phúza</em> ‘running away out of fear’ is described here at I.09.02 as the <em>hetaírē</em> ‘companion’ of <em>Phóbos</em>, which is a personification of <em>phóbos</em> ‘turning and running out of fear’. The immediate context is that the Trojans are now winning while the Achaeans are losing, I.09.1–2. The verse-final feminine form <em>hetaírē</em>, a morphologically leveled replacement of the older feminine form <em>hétairă</em>, likewise meaning ‘companion’, occurs only here in the <em>Iliad</em>. In this case, the morphological leveling can be explained as a replacement of the alternation *-́<em>i̯ă</em>-/-<em>i̯ā́</em>- by way of non-alternating *-<em>i̯ā́</em>-. In the <em>Odyssey</em> as well, feminine <em>hetaírē</em> occurs only once, O.17.271. Elsewhere in the Homeric tradition, feminine <em>hetaírē</em> occurs only in <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 31 and 478. In all three of these other occurrences as well, <em>hetaírē</em> is verse-final. The application of <em>hetaírē</em> to <em>Phúza</em> here at I.09.02 is comparable to the application of the vocalically rhyming form <em>krataiḗ</em> to <em>Moîra</em>, personification of <em>moîra</em> in the sense of ‘fate, destiny’. This form <em>krataiḗ</em>, which is likewise verse-final, is found nine times in the <em>Iliad</em> but not once in the <em>Odyssey</em>. For the occurrences, see the comment on I.05.083. As in the case of <em>hetaírē</em>, this feminine form <em>krataiḗ</em> can be explained as a morphologically leveled replacement of an older feminine form, to be reconstructed as *<em>krataí-u̯i-ă</em> and meaning ‘whose power [*<em>u̯i</em>-] has the upper-hand [<em>krátos</em>]’. In this case as well, the morphological leveling involves a replacement of the alternation *-́<em>i̯ă</em>-/-<em>i̯ā́</em>- by way of non-alternating *-<em>i̯ā́</em>-. </p>

See the comment on I.07.063–064.

<p>After the intervening simile, at I.09.004–008, of the storm at sea, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ felt by the Achaeans at I.09.003 is described further: this grief, it is said at I.09.008, is felt by them inside their collective ‘heart’, as expressed by <em>thūmos</em>. But then, at I.09.009, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ of I.09.003 is now reconfigured as the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ felt by the leader of the Achaeans, Agamemnon, in his individuated ‘heart’, as expressed this time by <em>ētor</em>, which is a partial synonym of <em>thūmos</em>. In this ring-composition, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ of verse 3 comes full circle with the synonym <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of verse 9, but the circle has in the meantime rotated the perspective from a collective to an individuated ‘heart’.  </p>

# Iliad 9.057-058

<p>Here at I.09.057–058, Nestor makes a remark to Diomedes about that hero’s relatively young age. You could be, Nestor tells Diomedes, the youngest of my sons. Elsewhere, at O.03.412–415, six of Nestor’s sons are mentioned, including Peisistratos, who figures prominently in the <em>Odyssey</em>, and Thrasymedes, who has a major role in the fighting at Troy in the <em>Iliad</em>. Missing from this list in the <em>Odyssey</em>, because he had been killed in action at Troy, is Antilokhos. There is a passing reference to the death of Antilokhos at O.04.186–188. When Nestor makes his remark at I.09.057–058 about the youngest of his sons, the referent here must be Antilokhos, since that hero’s relatively young age is noted elsewhere as well in the <em>Iliad</em>. For example, in a battle scene where the Achaeans are urging each other to fight hard, Menelaos singles out Antilokhos as he urges him on, telling him there is no Achaean there who is younger. And the relatively young age of Diomedes is likewise noted in the <em>Iliad</em>. In another battle scene, at I.14.109–114, while addressing his fellow warriors, Diomedes boasts that ‘I am the youngest among you’ (νεώτατός εἰμι μεθ’ ὑμῖν), I.14.112. So, it may be that Diomedes is even younger than Antilokhos, but that is not the point. Rather, the point is that Antilokhos and Diomedes are comparably young. Nestor himself highlights the youth of Antilokhos when he addresses him on a later occasion, I.23.306. In view of all these other Homeric references, Nestor’s remark at I.09.057–058 about Diomedes as comparable in age to Antilokhos can be seen as an evocation of an epic moment that is awaiting Nestor in the future. At that future moment, Antilokhos, his own young son, will try to save the old hero when Nestor gets entangled in his chariot and is about to be attacked and killed by the chariot fighter Memnon. Antilokhos will succeed in saving Nestor, but it is the young son and not the old father who will now get killed by Memnon. This epic moment, which is in the future for the <em>Iliad</em>, is evidently narrated in a part of the epic Cycle, the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, as we read in the plot-summary of Proclus p. 106 lines 4–6 (ed. Allen 1912). On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas. There is also a reference to this same epic moment in a song of Pindar, <em>Pythian</em> 6.28–42. These non–Iliadic passages have already been cited in the anchor comment on the relevant Iliadic passage, Ι.08.076–117. In that passage, which is already in the epic past from the standpoint of the current Iliadic passage taken from I.09.057–058, Diomedes was acting as a stand-in for Antilokhos, performing in the epic past a task that mirrors the task that will be undertaken by Antilokhos in the epic future. That task was to save Nestor from his entanglement in his chariot. Diomedes saved the life of Nestor, and Nestor knows it when he now compares young Diomedes to his own young son, I.09.057–058. As for Antilokhos, he too will save the life of Nestor, but, unlike Diomedes, he will lose his own life in performing this same task in the future, which is, to save Nestor from another entanglement. And of course Nestor does not yet know it. So, there is an irony in the remark made by the old hero here in comparing young Diomedes to young Antilokhos, though of course the character of Nestor did not intend such an irony. The intentionality, rather, is to be found in the poetics of evocation. </p>

<p>Agamemnon here at I.09.115 admits that it was <em>atē</em> for him to dishonor Achilles. In such a context, the noun <em>atē</em> can be translated as an ‘aberration’. The noun is used here in the plural, <em>atai</em>, indicating specific instances of aberration, not just an overall error. After all, in his quarrel with Achilles, Agamemnon insulted the prime hero of the <em>Iliad</em> in multiple ways. Agamemnon goes on to say that he is ready to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.09.120, for his aberrations. For Achilles to reject this compensation has its own risks, as we see in the comment on I.09.502–512: here too, there is a danger of <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’, Ι.09.512.  </p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, Achilles the Aeolian, seven captive Aeolian women from Lesbos, epic deeds of Achilles before the time dramatized in the Iliad

# Iliad 9.128-131

<p>Among the prizes that Agamemnon at I.09.128–131 offers as compensation to Achilles are seven captive Aeolian women who were captured by Achilles when he conquered the Aeolian island of Lesbos. The story about these women as it is told here is then retold at I.09.270–272. The significance of the Aeolian identification of these women will be analyzed in the anchor comment that follows. The focus in the present comment, by contrast, is on the moral problems that are raised in the story about the actual capture of these women—and of other women in the Iliad who suffer the same fate of captivity. Two prominent examples are Briseis and Chryseis, captured by Achilles when he conquered the cities of Lyrnessos and Thēbē respectively, as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694. All these women—the seven unnamed ones and the two named ones—evidently became the common property of the Achaeans after being captured by Achilles, and it appears that Agamemnon as the Achaean over-king originally had a say, ostensibly by way of public deliberation with the rest of the Achaeans, in deciding which woman was allotted as a war-prize to which Achaean man. Even though all these women were captured by Achilles alone, they were thereafter to be distributed as war-prizes among the Achaean men as a group. In terms of this reconstruction of the story as outlined here, the role of Agamemnon in having a say about the awarding of these captive women as war-prizes is morally problematic. Likewise problematic is this over-king’s role in the original awarding of the captive woman Briseis, with the approval of the Achaeans, as a war-prize to Achilles—and in the parallel awarding of the captive woman Chryseis to himself. Moreover, the seizing of Briseis by Agamemnon after his loss of Chryseis is even more problematic. Here, then, is the overriding question to be asked about the treatment of all these women as war-prizes: is Agamemnon entitled to have a say in deciding which Achaean man will have sex with which woman? And the question can be broadened: are the Achaeans as a group entitled to make such decisions? Such a broader question extends also to Achilles.  </p>

# Iliad 9.128–131/ anchor comment on: Aeolian women in the Iliad, part 2

<p>The story that is being told here at I.09.128–131 and retold at I.09.270–272 centers on one single stunning event: Achilles captured the entire island of Lesbos. By implication, this island became Aeolian precisely because it was captured by the principal hero of the Aeolians. The vastness of this story is even broader in scope, since we can see in the <em>Iliad</em> occasional references to other such conquests accomplished by Achilles. Most prominent are the Iliadic references to his capturing of two cities located on the Aeolian mainland of Asia Minor: they are Lyrnessos and Thēbē. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the conquest of Lyrnessos by Achilles and his capturing of Briseis are mentioned for the first time at I.02.690–691. What then follows at I.02.691 is a mention of his conquering the walled city of Thēbē as well. Thēbē is mentioned already at I.01.366: it was there that Achilles captured another woman, Chryseis, when he conquered that city, I.01.366–369. (For background on Briseis and on Chryseis, I again strongly recommend the work of Dué 2002 and 2006, listed in the Bibliography.) Another native of Thēbē was Andromache, who had been married off to Hector at Troy before the beginning of the Trojan War: she was taken captive only later, after Troy was captured, and she was then allotted as a war-prize to the son of Achilles, Neoptolemos: the story was told in an epic that was part of the epic Cycle and was known as the <em>Iliou Persis</em> ‘Destruction of Ilion’, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, plot summary by Proclus p. 108 line 9 (ed. Allen 1912). That said, I now elaborate further on the argument initiated in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694: the conquests of these territories by Achilles, especially his capture of Lesbos, can be interpreted as a charter myth that aetiologizes a prehistoric or even non-historical “colonization” of east Aeolis, as it were, by west Aeolian migrants from Thessaly, situated in the European mainland, which was the reputed birthplace of Achilles. (See Nagy 2011b:171–173.) In using the term “east Aeolis” here, I am referring to the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos, together with the facing mainland of northern Asia Minor. The “colonization” of this area has conventionally been described as the “Aeolian Migration,” and the term ‘migration’ here matches neatly the appropriate Greek word, <em>apoikiā</em> as used in Strabo 9.2.3 C401 and elsewhere (see Nagy 2011b:161). The reference at I.09.129 to the captive women from Lesbos can be correlated with the poetic traditions of Lesbos as later attested in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus, both dated around 600 BCE. These poetic traditions, which are decidedly Aeolian, derive not only from the island of Lesbos but also from the island of Tenedos and from the mainland of northern Asia Minor facing these two islands. (See HPC 184–185.) Traces of these Aeolian poetic traditions can be seen in the Iliadic references to such figures as Briseis, Chryseis, Andromache, and the seven unnamed captive women from Lesbos. All these figures derive from Aeolian poetic traditions, and the same can be said about the figure of Achilles himself: in terms of his poetic heritage, he is Achilles the Aeolian. (See Nagy 2011b:171–172.) But there is an important difference to be highlighted here: Achilles is an Aeolian from European Thessaly, while the captive women are Aeolians from Asia Minor and from the offshore islands of Lesbos and Tenedos (on the captive woman Hekamede from Tenedos, see the anchor comment at I.11.624–627). In the Ionian poetic traditions of epic as exemplified by Homeric poetry, we can track the early influence of corresponding Aeolian poetic traditions as exemplified at a later period, around 600 BCE, by the songmaking of Sappho and Alcaeus. See also anchor comment at I.02.689–694 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 1 and anchor comment at I.11.624–627 on: Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>, part 3.</p>

# Iliad 9.130

<p>The description of the women from Lesbos as victorious over other women in their beauty can be interpreted as a reference to a local tradition at Lesbos known as the <em>Kallisteia</em>, which was a kind of ritualized beauty contest for girls and for women. The scholia D for the <em>Iliad</em> give details, with specific reference to I.09.130: this beauty contest was a seasonally recurring event that took place in a federal space that was shared by five cities on the island of Lesbos, and this space was sacred to the goddess Hērā. See Nagy 2015§§135–159. There are occasional references to this space in what remains of the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus (again, Nagy 2015). Also, as we see at I.09.128, the beauty of the women of Lesbos is matched by the beauty of their handiwork, which externalizes their aristocratic charisma. Such handiwork, as we will see in another comment, comes to life in the skillfulness displayed by women in practicing their art of pattern-weaving: a prime example is Andromache the Aeolian, described at Ι.22.440–441 in the act of pattern-weaving. There and elsewhere, the craft of pattern-weaving by Aeolian women is linked with the power of the craft of Homeric poetry to make contact with the Bronze Age. (See MoM 2§§69–81.)  </p>

# Iliad 9.182–9.198

<p>As the three ambassadors and the two heralds proceed toward the shelter of Achilles, a series of dual forms is activated in the narrative, starting already with the very first verse and continuing from there: 182, 183, 185, 192, 196, 197, 198. The intervening plurals as at 186 are negligible, since plurals can normally substitute for duals in Homeric diction. But duals cannot substitute for plurals. So, the problem is, who are the referents in these contexts where the dual form is used? One way to approach the problem is to follow through on the formulation of Nestor, who had said that Phoenix must lead the embassy, I.09.168, followed by Ajax and then by Odysseus, I.09.169. See the comment on I.09.167–170. But then, when the group reaches the shelter of Achilles, it is said explicitly that Odysseus now takes the lead, I.09.192. Further, when Ajax signals to Phoenix at I.09.223, it is Odysseus who picks up the signal instead, as indicated by the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ (see further the comment on I.09.223), and now it will be Odysseus and not Phoenix who delivers the first of the three speeches. At I.09.224, Odysseus fills a goblet with wine and toasts Achilles—a gesture that may have seemed more appropriate for Achilles to perform as the host, not for Odysseus as the guest. For Odysseus to violate the etiquette is not to violate the traditions of myth, however, in t<em>hat it is traditional for the figure of Odysseus to violate rules of etiquette</em>. At O.08.475–476, to cite another example, Odysseus seems to be behaving like a host in a situation where he is really the guest. (For more on this point, see HQ 142.) In any case, right after pouring the wine and toasting Achilles, Odysseus starts at I.09.225 to deliver the first of the three speeches addressed by the three ambassadors to Achilles. Only after this speech of Odysseus, I.09.225–306, and after the reply of Achilles to that speech, I.09.308–429, will Phoenix get a chance to give his own speech, I.09.434–605—even though Nestor had intended for Phoenix to be the first speaker. So, returning to I.09.192, where Odysseus already takes the lead away from Phoenix, we can view this point in the narrative as the marker of a transition: before this point, the dual forms could refer to Ajax and Odysseus, as led by Phoenix, but then, after this point, the dual forms could refer to Phoenix and Ajax, as led by Odysseus. Alternatively the dual forms in these verses could have an elliptic function, where a singular X is paired with a group Y. This way, the dual still refers to a pair, even though the second part of the pair is a group.  </p>

# Iliad 09.185–191

<p>As the three ambassadors and the two heralds enter the shelter of Achilles, they find the hero singing <em>klea andrōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men’ while his companion Patroklos is listening to the song, waiting to continue it where Achilles will leave off. We see here a dramatization of relay singing, which is a model for the poetic world of <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’ who perform Homeric poetry in sequence. But the relay from one performance to the next is a sequencing that does not have to happen only at one particular time. The sequencing can be seen as happening over time. Relevant here is the meaning of the name of Patroklos, <em>Patrokléēs</em> ‘he who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’. Here the etymology of the name is adjusted by way of interpreting the component <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ in the plural sense of the word, not only in the singular sense that was noted in the comment on I.01.345. In terms of this meaning, the <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ of song is passed on, from one generation to the next, as the living heritage of the <em>patéres</em> ‘ancestors’. As for the original singing of Achilles himself in his shelter, it mirrors the singing of the god Apollo, who performs his songs while accompanying himself on the lyre. In the case of the lyre played by Achilles as he sings, it had once belonged to Eëtion, father of Andromache. As we have seen in the anchor comment at I.06.407–439, Andromache in the <em>Iliad</em> sings laments in expressing her sorrows. Such singing is relevant to songs sung about and perhaps also by Achilles himself. In the case of songs sung about Achilles, we know for a fact that these songs touched on that hero’s direct involvement in the sorrowful fate of Andromache herself. On that involvement, see the comment on I.17.194–214.</p>

# Iliad 9.193-9.198

<p>Achilles greets the ambassadors in the dual, I.09.197–198, and not in the plural. And he refers to them first as <em>philoi</em> ‘near and dear’, I.09.197, and then as the <em>philtatoi</em> ‘most near and dear’ among the Achaeans, I.09.198; again at I.09.204, he refers to them as <em>philtatoi</em> ‘most near and dear’. But are the ambassadors really at the very top of this hero’s ascending scale of affection? The dual construction of the verb in the syntax of I.09.197 might indicate that one of the three ambassadors is being left out of the hero’s reference to his nearest and dearest friends among all the Achaeans. The ambassador who might be left out is Odysseus. At I.09.312–313, Achilles says to Odysseus: whoever says one thing but means another thing is as <em>ekhthros</em> ‘hateful’ to me as the Gates of Hādēs, I.09.313.  </p>

# Iliad 9.249-250

<p>As Odysseus warns, I.09.249, Achilles will suffer <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ in some unforeseeable way if he does not help the Achaeans right now. And there will be no <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ for the pain of this grief, I.09.250. The warning will come true, since the future death of Patroklos will turn Achilles into <em>a man of constant sorrow</em>. See especially the comment on I.18.015–073; also the comment on I.23.046–047. Of special interest here at I.09.249–250 is the morphological parallelism of <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ at I.09.249 with <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ at I.09.250. Another morphological parallel for <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ is the synonym <em>althos</em> ‘remedy’. Whereas <em>akos</em> and <em>althos</em> are synonyms, they are both antonyms of <em>akhos</em>, and the morphological parallelism of all three words serves to highlight the semantic contrast of <em>akhos</em> on one side with <em>akos</em> and <em>althos</em> on the other side. The morphological parallelism extends to names derived from the antonyms <em>althos</em> and <em>akhos</em>, since <em>althos</em> ‘remedy’ is to <em>Althaiā</em> as <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ is to <em>Akhaiā</em> (see BA 88).  </p>

# Iliad 9.270-272

<p>Among the prizes that Agamemnon at I.09.128–131 offers as compensation to Achilles are seven captive Aeolian women who were captured by Achilles when he conquered the Aeolian island of Lesbos. The story about these women as it is told here is then retold at I.09.270–272. The significance of the Aeolian identification of these women will be analyzed in the anchor comment that follows. The focus in the present comment, by contrast, is on the moral problems that are raised in the story about the actual capture of these women—and of other women in the <em>Iliad</em> who suffer the same fate of captivity. Two prominent examples are Briseis and Chryseis, captured by Achilles when he conquered the cities of Lyrnessos and Thēbē respectively, as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–694. All these women—the seven unnamed ones and the two named ones—evidently became the common property of the Achaeans after being captured by Achilles, and it appears that Agamemnon as the Achaean over-king originally had a say, ostensibly by way of public deliberation with the rest of the Achaeans, in deciding which woman was allotted as a war-prize to which Achaean man. Even though all these women were captured by Achilles alone, they were thereafter to be distributed as war-prizes among the Achaean men as a group. In terms of this reconstruction of the story as outlined here, the role of Agamemnon in having a say about the awarding of these captive women as war-prizes is morally problematic. Likewise problematic is this over-king’s role in the original awarding of the captive woman Briseis, with the approval of the Achaeans, as a war-prize to Achilles—and in the parallel awarding of the captive woman Chryseis to himself. Moreover, the seizing of Briseis by Agamemnon after his loss of Chryseis is even more problematic. Here, then, is the overriding question to be asked about the treatment of all these women as war-prizes: is Agamemnon entitled to have a say in deciding which Achaean man will have sex with which woman? And the question can be broadened: are the Achaeans as a group entitled to make such decisions? Such a broader question extends also to Achilles.  </p>

And that is why it can be argued that the earlier wording of Achilles in greeting the ambassadors is designed to exclude Odysseus from the company of those who are near and dear.

tags: Aeolian Dodecapolis, Achilles conquers 11 cities on foot and 12 cities by way of ships, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 9.328–333

<p>I suggest that the story embedded here about 11 cities that Achilles conquers on foot, I.09.329–333, may be an indirect reference to the 12 cities of the Aeolian Dodecapolis minus Smyrna, which was lost to the Ionians. By contrast, Achilles conquers 12 other cities not on foot but <em>sun nēusi</em> (σὺν νηυσί) ‘by way of ships’, I.09.328. Similarly at I.06.640–642, Hēraklēs had earlier conquered Troy itself <em>hex oiēis sun nēusi</em> (ἓξ οἴῃς σὺν νηυσί) ‘by way of merely six ships’, I.06.641. The analogous deed of Hēraklēs here leads me to think that Achilles too was conquering the 12 cities in the vicinity of Troy, whereas the other 11 cities would have been situated further south on the mainland of Asia Minor, that is, in the territory of the ancient Aeolian Dodecapolis. Herodotus 1.149.1 lists the cities of the Aeolian Dodecapolis, and one of them happens to be Killa. I think that this Killa is the same place that is mentioned twice in the <em>Iliad</em>, I.01.038 and I.01.452, in the context of Aeolian places that are specially sacred to Apollo. The two other places mentioned both times in those passages at I.01.038–039 and at I.01.451–452 are Chrysa and Tenedos. It has been argued that the Homeric Killa cannot be the same place as the Killa mentioned by Herodotus (Leaf 1923:310), but such arguments are based on the assumption that Homeric Killa was near Lyrnessos and Thēbē, two other places said to be conquered by Achilles. Herodotus 1.151.1 notes that the Aeolian cities on the mainland of northern Asia Minor in the region of Mount Ida—that is, in the general area of ancient Troy—were grouped separately from the Aeolian Dodecapolis, but he does not list those cities by name. The reason, I suspect, is that any federation of cities situated in this area would have been already severely disrupted by the Athenian empire in the fifth century BCE, that is, in the era of Herodotus, and, earlier, by the domination of this area by the Aeolian city of Mytilene in the seventh and the sixth centuries BCE. In that era, this city on the island of Lesbos was a major rival of Athens in seeking to possess the sacred real estate, so to speak, of ancient Troy and its environs. See Point 7 in the anchor comment that follows immediately below.  </p>

# Iliad 9.328–333/ anchor comment on: efforts of Aeolians to possess ancient Troy and its environs in the historical period

<p>There are ten points in this anchor comment, epitomized mostly from HPC 131–146: </p><p>Point 1. Our point of departure is New Ilion, which in the historical period was an Aeolian city built over the ruins of the old Troy of the Trojan War as narrated in the epic that we know as the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. Archaeologists have verified that Hisarlık, which is the Turkish name for the site of New Ilion, was in fact the same place as the site of old Troy, which was also known in the ancient world as Ilion. [HPC 131]</p><p>Point 2. After a major destruction of the citadel at old Troy sometime around the beginning of the 12th century BCE, which marks the end of a phase that archaeologists recognize as Troy VIIa, the importance of the site was radically diminished, and things stayed that way through the phase known as Troy VIIb, lasting into the 10th century BCE. After Troy VIIb comes Troy VIII, which marks a “Greek era” extending all the way to the so-called “Roman era” that is Troy IX. In the earliest phase of Troy VIII, from the 10th to the mid-7th century BCE, a small population was occupying the area of the citadel, and, on the western side of the citadel wall, they left behind some archaeological remains of a “place of memory” that must have commemorated in some way the epic traditions of the Trojan War (Aslan and Rose 2013:11). At a later phase of Troy VIII, in the mid-7th century BCE, there was a destruction, to be followed in the late 7th century by a reoccupation. From this time onward, in the latest phase of Troy VIII, we see the beginnings of the historical period. Now the old Troy is on its way to becoming the new Troy, that is, New Ilion. [HPC 131.]</p><p>Point 3. As in modern times, the old Troy of New Ilion was sought out in antiquity, most prominently by rulers striving to link themselves with the heroes who fought in the Trojan War of the epic past. In 480 BCE, as we read in Herodotus 7.43.2, Xerxes the king of the Persian Empire traveled to New Ilion and made sacrifice there to the goddess Athena, and his magi made libations to the <em>hērōes</em> ‘heroes’ who were entombed in the environs. Over a century later, Alexander the Great likewise sacrificed to Athena in New Ilion (Strabo 13.1.26 C593; Arrian <em>Anabasis</em> 1.11.7). [HPC 131–132.]</p><p>Point 4. I highlight the term used by Herodotus here at 7.43.2 in referring to the goddess Athena as worshipped in her sacred space at New Ilion: she is <em>hē Ilias</em>, meaning something like ‘she who is in Ilion’. But the name can also be interpreted to mean ‘she who is in the Iliad’, in the sense that <em>Ilias</em> as an ‘Iliad’ means simply ‘the song about Ilion’. [HPC 126.] </p><p>Point 5. Elsewhere, at 5.122.2, Herodotus uses the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> in referring to <em>the territory of Ilion as inhabited by Aeolians</em>. The context is this: a Persian general was redeploying his forces at the time of the Ionian Revolt, ongoing in the first decade of the 5th century BCE, and he was moving his troops westward in the direction of the Hellespont (ἐπὶ τὸν Ἑλλήσποντον). Then, along the way to the Hellespont, ‘he captured all the Aeolians who inhabit the territory of Ilion [<em>hē Ilias</em>]’ (καὶ εἷλε μὲν Αἰολέας πάντας ὅσοι τὴν Ἰλιάδα νέμονται). This detail from Herodotus concerning <em>hē Ilias</em> as ‘the territory of Ilion’ is a most valuable piece of evidence showing that New Ilion was at this time inhabited by <em>Aioleîs</em> ‘Aeolians’. I should add that there is a plethora of further evidence showing the Aeolian identity of New Ilion in the era of Troy VIII. [HPC 142–146.]</p><p>Point 6. But now we must confront a big complication. This New Ilion was not the only ‘new Ilion’. As early as the late seventh century BCE, a rival ‘new Ilion’ emerged, and its occupants claimed that their site replaced the real Troy of olden days. This alternative New Ilion was located not far from the old Troy, but it was a different site. The inherited name of the site was Sigeion, and it was situated on a promontory at Kum Kale, overlooking the entrance to the narrows of the Hellespont. Archaeologists have securely identified the site at Cape Yenişehir as Sigeion. [HPC 143; see the map at HPC 158.] </p><p>Point 7. Like the New Ilion that was built over the old Troy, the site of Sigeion used to be occupied by Aeolians. Also, for some time in the seventh century BCE, Sigeion had been dominated by one particular sub-group of Aeolians, namely, the elites of Mytilene, which was then the most powerful city in Lesbos, an Aeolian island situated due west across the sea from the Aeolian mainland of northern Asia Minor. As we read in Strabo 13.1.38 C599, the Mytilenaeans under the leadership of one Archeanax built the walls of the citadel of Sigeion from the stones of the ruined walls of the ancient citadel of Troy. Strabo thinks that this important piece of information validates arguments made in the second century BCE by the antiquarian Demetrius of Scepsis, who denied any continuity between the old Ilion and the city of New Ilion as it existed in his own day, claiming that there was no trace left of the old Ilion—and that the site of this old city was not New Ilion but rather a village located some 30 stadium-lenghts to the southeast, in the territory of Scepsis. In terms of the theory posited by Demetrius, all the stones of the old Ilion had been used up in the process of building the walls of other cities like Sigeion. But we have already seen at Point 2 that the stones of the old Ilion were in fact still very much in evidence throughout the phase known as Troy VIII, and so the theory of Demetrius is invalidated. See also the comment on I.07.433–465 on the myth about the building of the Trojan Wall by Poseidon and Apollo for Laomedon, who had been king of Troy before Priam, I.07.452–453. Still, the information reported by Demetrius and transmitted by Strabo about the re-using of stones from old Troy for the building of new Troys retains its full value. A shining example of another such new Troy was the Aeolian city of Neon Teikhos ‘New Wall’, which belonged to a confederation of twelve Aeolian cities situated on the mainland of Asia Minor and commonly known as the Aeolian Dodecapolis (Herodotus 1.149.1 lists them all). [HPC 145–146. About Neon Teikhos, see also HPC 180.]</p><p>Point 8. Unlike New Ilion, which remained an Aeolian site, the city of Sigeion underwent a drastic change in identity, and this happened already in the late seventh century BCE. Somewhere around that time, control of Sigeion was seized by the Ionian city of Athens and taken away from the Aeolian city of Mytilene-in-Lesbos, which had dominated Sigeion earlier, as we saw at Point 7. I cannot go into details here about this drastic change, but I will at least highlight the fact that Sigeion is pictured as already belonging to Athens in the poetry of Alcaeus, who can be dated to the late seventh century BCE. Herodotus notes that Alcaeus himself says in his own poetry that his armor was captured from him by the Athenians in a battle against the Mytilenaeans, and that it was displayed by the enemy at the <em>Athḗnaion</em> ‘sacred space of Athena’ in Sigeion. Here is the way Herodotus says it at 5.95.1: ‘the Athenians have his [= Alcaeus’] armor and they have hung it up for display at the space of Athena [<em>Athḗnaion</em>] in Sigeion’ (τὰ δέ οἱ ὅπλα ἴσχουσι Ἀθηναῖοι καί σφεα ἀνεκρέμασαν πρὸς τὸ Ἀθήναιον τὸ ἐν Σιγείῳ). Strabo quotes the words of Alcaeus telling about the captured armor, and these words actually give the name of Athena’s sacred space as <em>Glaukṓpion</em> (Alcaeus F 401B via Strabo 13.1.37 C600). This same name <em>Glaukṓpion</em>, derived from the sacred epithet of Athena <em>glaukôpis</em> ‘having the looks of the owl’, is attested in Athens as well. There it applies to the sacred space of Athena Nike at the southwest corner of the acropolis (Callimachus F 238.11), and this space, like the <em>Glaukṓpion</em> in Sigeion, can be dated at around 600 BCE. On the protracted war between the Athenians and the Mytilenaeans over the possession of Sigeion, I cite the primary sources here: Herodotus (5.94–95), Strabo (13.1.38–39 C599–600), and Diogenes Laertius (1.74); a most admirable secondary source is Aloni 1986. [HPC 142–146.]</p><p>Point 9. Just as Athena had a sacred space in the new Ilion of Sigeion, so also she had her own sacred space in the New Ilion built on top of the old Troy, where as we have already read in Herodotus 7.43.2 the goddess was worshipped as <em>hē Ilias</em>, meaning not only ‘she who is in Ilion’ but also ‘she who is in the Iliad’. As noted at Point 4, such an ‘Iliad’ was not the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> that we have but instead ‘the song about Ilion’ as it was known then—and as it was known even earlier when the occupants of Troy VIII were already venerating a “place of memory” commemorating the epic traditions of the Trojan War, as we saw at Point 2. [HPC 131.]</p><p>Point 10. There may be some uncertainties about positively identifying an earlier version of ‘Iliadic’ Athena—<em>hē Ilias</em>—as the goddess who presided over the “place of memory” in the early phases of Troy VIII, but we can be quite certain about the actual linking of the old Troy with epic traditions about an old Troy. And here again the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> applies: at Point 5, we already saw that Herodotus 5.122.2 says <em>hē Ilias</em> in referring to the territory of Ilion as inhabited by <em>Aioleîs</em> ‘Aeolians’. But now we will see that Herodotus also uses the same expression <em>hē Ilias</em> in a context where he refers to a territory belonging not only to Ilion but also to the Iliadic tradition of poetry. The context is this: Herodotus is describing a scene where representatives of the cities of Mytilene and Athens, which have evidently already fought in many wars over the possession of Sigeion, are submitting their dispute to inter-state arbitration, and now the Aeolians of Mytilene are demanding that the Athenians give back to them the territory of Sigeion and its environs (Herodotus 5.94.2): ‘You see, the Mytilenaeans and the Athenians had been waging war with each other for the longest time. One side [= the Mytilenaeans] operated out of the city [<em>polis</em>] of Akhílleion and the other side [= the Athenians], out of Sigeion. They [= the Mytilenaeans] were demanding the return of the territory [<em>khōrā</em>], but the Athenians rejected the demand, trying to demonstrate by way of what they said that the Aeolians were no more entitled to the Iliadic territory [<em>hē Ilias khōrā</em>] than were they [= the Athenians] and all the other Hellenes who had joined forces in avenging Menelaos for the abduction of Helen’ (ἐπολέμεον γὰρ ἔκ τε Ἀχιλληίου πόλιος ὁρμώμενοι καὶ Σιγείου ἐπὶ χρόνον συχνὸν Μυτιληναῖοί τε καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι, οἱ μὲν ἀπαιτέοντες τὴν χώρην, Ἀθηναῖοι δὲ οὔτε συγγινωσκόμενοι ἀποδεικνύντες τε λόγῳ οὐδὲν μᾶλλον Αἰολεῦσι μετεὸν τῆς Ἰλιάδος χώρης ἢ οὐ καὶ σφίσι καὶ τοῖσι ἄλλοισι, ὅσοι Ἑλλήνων συνεπρήξαντο Μενέλεῳ τὰς Ἑλένης ἁρπαγάς). As the wording of Herodotus indicates, the Aeolian city of Mytilene in Lesbos claimed to be representing all Aeolic-speaking Hellenes in claiming possession of the Iliadic territory of Sigeion in the Troad. By contrast, the city of Athens claimed to be representing all Hellenes who took part in the Trojan War. From the standpoint of both sides, then, the disputed territory is poetic as well as political.  </p>

# Iliad 09.346–352

<p>Achilles in his speech here returns to something that Odysseus had said at I.09.241–243: how the Achaeans are afraid that Hector’s fire will reach their ships beached at the Hellespont, and that such a disaster would surely destroy them. Achilles now gives a biting response at I.09.347: let Agamemnon find a way to ward off the fire of Hector without the help of Achilles. The verb used here for the idea of finding a way, <em>phrazesthai</em> ‘devise a plan’, is correlated with the noun <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in Homeric diction, as we see in the wording of Achilles at a later point, I.09.423. Since Odysseus is the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in Homeric poetry, Achilles is in effect saying to him at I.09.347: let Agamemnon rely on your <em>mētis</em>, Odysseus, since he cannot any longer rely on my <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’. As we see in another comment, Achilles is the primary exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ in Homeric poetry, just as Odysseus is the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’. According to the Scholia A for I.09.347, Aristarchus apparently thought that the passage we are now considering, I.09.346–352, was an allusion to another passage, O.08.072–083, which is about a quarrel that once took place between Achilles and Odysseus over one overriding question: will Troy be conquered by relying on the physical power of Achilles or on the mental power of Odysseus?</p>

# Iliad 09.410–416

<p>From the standpoint of its etymology, derived as it is from the verb <em>keirein</em> ‘cut, slice’, the noun <em>kḗr</em> in the sense of a ‘cut’ or a ‘slice’ or a ‘portion’ need not convey the negative idea of a ‘fated death’. When a hero chooses between two alternative <em>kêres</em> or ‘fates’, one of the two alternatives may be death but the other may be life. Thus when Achilles here speaks of two alternative <em>kêres</em> or ‘fates’ that may await him, namely, either the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ that he will get if he dies young in the Trojan War or the <em>nostos</em> or ‘homecoming’ that will be his if he abandons that war, the second alternative is not really a ‘fated death’ for Achilles as is the first alternative. Instead, a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ would give him life. But this life would be limited. It would last only until the hero’s age runs out of time, just as the age of a plant will surely run out of time. Conversely, the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that the hero would get from dying young in the Trojan War would have an unlimited life of its own, because this <em>kleos</em> is conferred by poetry, and this poetry is held to be imperishable.</p>

# Iliad 9.413

<p> The <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of the song that glorifies Achilles will be <em>aphthiton</em> ‘imperishable, unwilting’, I.09.413. The analysis here will focus first on the general sense of ‘imperishable’ and then on the specific sense of ‘unwilting’. The Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ here at I.09.413 is parallel to the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7 (full argumentation in GMP 123–126). From the standpoint of the formulaic system inherited by Homeric diction, the function of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> in combination with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ in the expression <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413 can be not only predicative, ‘the glory will be imperishable’, but also attributive, ‘there will be a glory that is imperishable’. An attributive syntax is indicated by the shorter expression <em>kleos estai</em> (κλέος ἔσται), as at I.07.458, meaning ‘there will be a glory’. There is also the comparative evidence of the attributive syntax that we see at work in the cognate wording of Sappho Song 44.4, … <em>kleos aphthiton</em> (… κλέος ἄφθιτον) ‘imperishable glory’ (line-final), and of Ibycus S151.47, … <em>kleos aphthiton hexeis</em> (… κλέος ἄφθιτον ἑξεῖς) ‘you will have imperishable glory’ (line-final). On the other hand, the expression <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413 seems to be coefficient with the expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) as at I.02.325, ‘the glory will never perish’. See the comment on I.02.325. The syntax of <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> ‘the glory will never perish’, if we compare it to the syntax of <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> at I.09.413, may point to a predicative use of the adjective <em>aphthiton</em>: ‘the glory will be imperishable’. It has been suggested that the expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) ‘the glory will never perish’ could have been used instead of <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) even at I.09.413 if it were not for the fact that the word <em>ōleto</em> (ὤλετο) ‘perished’ (the subject is <em>nostos</em> ‘[safe] homecoming’) is already used at the beginning of the same verse. It does not follow, however, that the wording <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) instead of <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται) at I.09.413 must be some kind of a reactive innovation: on the contrary, this wording can be an archaism that survives precisely for the stylistic purpose of avoiding an awkward duplication of wording in the same verse. As a general approach to poetics, I suggest that allowance should regularly be made for the possibility that older forms can be activated in situations where a more innovative equivalent form might create a poetically awkward side-effect (GMP 122–123). That said, my focus of analysis now shifts from the general sense of the adjective <em>aphthito</em>- as ‘imperishable’ to its specific sense as ‘unwilting’. This sense has already been noted in the comments on I.01.155, I.02.046, I.02.325. Unlike a plant that runs out of time, the <em>kleos</em> of poetic ‘glory’ is like an imperishable flower that will never wilt, never lose its vibrant color and aroma. Accordingly, the <em>kleos aphthiton</em> of Achilles will be like an unwilting flower. And the way for a hero to be adorned with such an unwilting flower is to experience a fated death. That is why the alternative of death in a choice between <em>kēres</em> ‘fates’ is the desired choice for the hero to make. And that is why the meaning of <em>kḗr</em> defaults to ‘a fated death’ as desired by heroes in the epic world of heroes. See again the overall comment on I.09.410–416. For Achilles, the <em>kleos aphthiton</em> ‘unwilting glory’ that he chooses is really an alternative form of life, while the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ that he ultimately rejects is an alternative form of death, since the name of his homeland is <em>Phthiē</em>, a “speaking name” (<em>nomen</em> <em>loquens</em>) that means literally ‘the land of wilting’. See the comment on I.01.155. See also HPC 168n67 on the ritualized idea of wearing garlands that are ‘unwilting’ in a Thessalian ritual that honors Achilles. By contrast with the hero Achilles, however, who chooses <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ instead of a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, the hero Odysseus does not need to make a choice. In fact, as we will see in a future comment, Odysseus cannot even make such a choice, since he needs a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ to achieve his own <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’, which will be ‘a song of homecoming’. </p>

The <em>Litai</em>, goddesses of supplication personified, I.09.502, afflict with <em>atē</em> a man who does wrong by showing cruelty to suppliants and rejecting their supplications, I.09.510–512. The warning here is intended for Achilles. But why is it that Achilles should heed the <em>Litai</em>? An answer emerges at I.09.507, where the <em>Litai</em> are said to heal the damage caused by the <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that is committed by wrongdoers when these wrongdoers offer compensation for such <em>atē</em>. As we saw in the comment on I.09.115–120, Agamemnon admits his <em>atē</em> ‘aberration, for which he stands ready to offer <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.09.120. In rejecting the <em>Litai</em>, one is rejecting the process whereby compensation can be awarded for damage suffered—and the word for ‘damage’ is <em>Atē</em> personified at I.09.504 and I.09.505. Further, the punishment for such refusal is another round of <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’—this time suffered by the one who rejects the <em>Litai</em>, I.09.510–512. For Achilles, such an <em>atē</em> would be the death of his other self, Patroklos, who personally experiences <em>atē</em> at the moment of his death, I.16.805, in the form of an aberration of the senses. See the comments on I.16.685–687 and on I.16.804–806. At I.19.268–275, Achilles seems to recognize that both he and Agamemnon have in the end been afflicted with <em>atē</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 9.524–599

<p>The story told by Phoenix about Meleagros and Kleopatra is introduced at the very beginning, I.09.524, by the expression <em>houtō</em> ‘this is how’, which conventionally introduces a discourse containing a moral message, such as a fable. The Greek word for such discourse is <em>ainos</em>, the meaning of which is impossible to translate by way of any single English word. For want of a better alternative, I define <em>ainos</em> pragmatically as ‘coded words’—a ‘coded message’. In the case of the story told by Phoenix, it is intended to carry a moral message for Achilles. The story is described, already at I.09.524, as <em>klea andrōn</em> | <em>hērōōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men who were heroes’. By convention, such an expression refers to song, especially to the medium of epic. We saw at I.09.185–191 a truncated version of this expression, <em>klea andrōn</em>, ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men’, I.09.189, and the performer in that context was Achilles himself, singing his song while accompanying himself on the lyre. The male hero in the story of Phoenix, Meleagros, is like Achilles. He too is angry at his community, and he too has withdrawn from fighting in a war, leaving his own people in desperate trouble. Those who are near and dear to him now approach Meleagros, imploring him to return to the fight and making their appeals to him as suppliants. The narrative arranges the order of the suppliants in terms of the hero’s ascending scale of affection. Those who are starting off on the lower levels of this scale will be mentioned earlier, while those who end up on the higher levels will be mentioned later. So, the highest someone on this scale will be mentioned last. Near the top of the scale are the <em>hetairoi</em> ‘companions’ of Meleagros, I.09.585, who are described at I.09.586 as <em>philtatoi</em> ‘nearest and dearest’ to him. So also Phoenix thinks that he and his fellow ambassadors, as companions of Achilles, should be placed at the very top of his ascending scale of affection. But the highest person on the ascending scale of affection for Meleagros turns out to be his wife, named <em>Kleopatra</em>, I.09.556. Her name fits the moral message of the story, since <em>Kleopátrā</em> means ‘she who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors’. Thus Kleopatra is the very embodiment of the story described as <em>klea andrōn</em> | <em>hērōōn</em> ‘the glories [<em>klea</em>] of men who were heroes’, since heroes are figured as stylized ancestors of the community. But the question is, what meaning will this story have for Achilles? For this hero, the top of his own ascending scale of affection will turn out to be Patroklos, whose full name, <em>Patrokléēs</em>, has the same meaning as the name of <em>Kleopátrā</em>, but the two elements of the name, <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ and <em>pateres</em> ‘ancestors’ are in reverse. Each of the two names is a “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), and both names mean ‘he/she who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors’. Further, as noted in the comment for I.09.185–191, the etymology of the name <em>Patrokléēs</em> can be adjusted by way of interpreting the component <em>kléos</em> ‘glory’ in the plural sense of the word, not only in the singular sense: ‘he who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’. And the same can be said for <em>Kleopátrā</em>: ‘she who has the glories [<em>klé(e)a</em> of the ancestors [<em>patéres</em>]’.  </p>

# Iliad 9.561–564

<p>Here at I.09.561–564, it is revealed that Kleopatra had a second “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), and that this name had to do with the singing of laments. Her second name was <em>Alkuónē</em>, I.09.562, which was given to her as a reminder of sorrows suffered by her mother, who is said to have lamented just as a songbird laments, I.09.562–564. The lamenting songbird here is the <em>halkúōn</em> ‘halcyon’, described as <em>polupenthēs</em> ‘having much grief’, I.09.563. See also the comments on I.22.483 and on Ι.24.708, analyzing further contexts where <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is connected with singing songs of ritual lament.  </p>

# Iliad 10.000

<p>At the very beginning of the Iliadic text of Rhapsody 10, we find an interesting claim in the accompanying annotations known as the T Scholia, which stem from Homeric research ongoing in the ancient world. According to that claim, this <em>rhapsōidíā</em> had been composed by Homer separately, not as part of the <em>Iliad</em>, and the separate composition was later arranged, <em>tetákhthai</em>, by Peisistratos to fit into the <em>Iliad</em>. Such a sense of separateness in the content of Rhapsody 10—a separateness already noted, as we have just seen, in the ancient world—is due at least in part to a single basic fact: <em>the actions of heroes here take place at night, not in the daytime</em>. The tactics and even the ethics of nighttime warfare are in many ways different from the protocols of daytime warfare as narrated in the rest of the <em>Iliad</em>, and the differences are traced in the commentary of Dué and Ebbott 2010. And I would add that there are cognate patterns of nighttime warfare in Iranian epic traditions: see Davidson 2013:95–97 (for relevant observations on the figure of Dolon in Rhapsody 10 of the <em>Iliad</em>, see also Davidson 1979). As for the ancient claim that Rhapsody 10 was supposedly inserted into a pre-existing series of 23 rhapsodies, I have serious problems even with the chronology of such a claim. Whereas Peisistratos of Athens lived in the sixth century BCE, the division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> each into 24 performance-units or <em>rhapsōidiai</em> can now plausibly be dated as far back as the late eighth and early seventh century BCE: see Nagy <em>Classical Inquiries </em>2015.12.24 following Frame 2009 ch. 11. My view here supersedes an earlier view of mine as noted in <em>Poetry as Performance</em> 181–182, where I considered the era of Demetrius of Phaleron, late fourth century BCE, as a possible setting for the division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> into 24 <em>rhapsōidiai</em>.</p>

# Iliad 10.1ff

<p>The opening lines of this book follow what seems to be a traditional pattern in which a pressing situation causes an inability to sleep, which in turn results in the formulation of a plan of action. We can compare 10.1ff. to the beginnings of Books 2 and 9 for a more complete understanding of the workings and traditional structure of this theme. <em>Iliad</em> 2 begins:</p><p>ἄλλοι μέν ῥα θεοί τε καὶ ἀνέρες ἱπποκορυσταὶ</p><p>εὗδον παννύχιοι, Δία δ᾽ οὐκ <strong>ἔχε</strong> νήδυμος ὕπνος,</p><p>ἀλλ᾽ ὅ γε μερμήριζε κατὰ φρένα ὡς Ἀχιλῆα</p><p>τιμήσῃ, ὀλέσῃ δὲ πολέας ἐπὶ νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν.</p><p>ἥδε δέ οἱ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀρίστη φαίνετο <strong>βουλή</strong> …</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 2.1–5</p><p>The rest of the gods and the men who wear horse–hair helmets</p><p>slept all night long, but deep sleep did not <strong>hold</strong> Zeus.</p><p>Instead, he was divided in his mind how Achilles</p><p>he would honor, and cause the destruction of many at the ships of the Achaeans.</p><p>This is the <strong>plan</strong> that seemed best in his heart …</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9 similarly starts at night:</p><p>ὣς οἱ μὲν Τρῶες φυλακὰς <strong>ἔχον</strong><em>·</em> αὐτὰρ Ἀχαιοὺς</p><p>θεσπεσίη <strong>ἔχε</strong> φύζα φόβου κρυόεντος ἑταίρη,</p><p>πένθεϊ δ᾽ ἀτλήτῳ βεβολήατο πάντες ἄριστοι.</p><p>ὡς δ᾽ ἄνεμοι δύο πόντον ὀρίνετον ἰχθυόεντα</p><p>5  Βορέης καὶ Ζέφυρος, τώ τε Θρῄκηθεν ἄητον</p><p>ἐλθόντ᾽ ἐξαπίνης<em>·</em> ἄμυδις δέ τε κῦμα κελαινὸν</p><p>κορθύεται, πολλὸν δὲ παρὲξ ἅλα φῦκος ἔχευεν<em>·</em></p><p>ὣς ἐδαΐζετο θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν.</p><p>Ἀτρεΐδης δ᾽ ἄχεϊ μεγάλῳ βεβολημένος ἦτορ</p><p>10  φοίτα κηρύκεσσι λιγυφθόγγοισι κελεύων</p><p>κλήδην εἰς ἀγορὴν κικλήσκειν ἄνδρα ἕκαστον …</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9.1–11</p><p>So the Trojans <strong>kept holding</strong> watches. But the Achaeans</p><p><strong>were held</strong> by awesome panic, the companion of chilling fear,</p><p>and all the best men were struck by unendurable sorrow.</p><p>As when two winds stir up the sea with all its fish,</p><p>5  the North wind and the West wind, which blow from Thrace</p><p>coming suddenly, and at the same time a dark wave</p><p>towers up, and it pours out much seaweed alongside the sea,</p><p>so the heart in the breasts of the Achaeans was torn.</p><p>And the son of Atreus, struck in his heart by great sorrow,</p><p>10  went about telling the clear-voiced heralds</p><p>to call each man by name to assembly …</p><p>The use of ἔχω ‘hold’ in all three passages suggests that even such a common verb can have a traditional poetic resonance in this context. The simile in 9.4–7 resembles the simile in 10.5–8 (discussed further below), in that both use an example from the natural world to convey a heightened emotional state. Whereas in Books 9 and 10 it is Agamemnon and/or the Achaean warriors who are in turmoil, in Book 2 it is Zeus who cannot sleep, as he turns over in his mind how best to accomplish what he has promised to Thetis in Book 1. (Agamemnon, by contrast, is sleeping soundly in this book, and the Dream sent by Zeus reproaches him for it at <em>Iliad</em> 2.23–24.) Zeus’ sleeplessness in Book 2 is not elaborated with a simile, but there the emotional state being conveyed is not one of great sorrow and fear, as it is in Books 9 and 10. The sorrow evoked by the similes of 9 and 10 marks in each case the beginning of a change in plan that will lead to a nighttime episode, a sequence that is in keeping with the incendiary power of lament. (For more on the similes’ associations with lament, see below. On the power of lament to spur action, see Dué 2006a:47 and bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>)</p><p>The three passages together give us a sense of both the strongly felt structure and the flexibility of the traditional system in which they were composed. In Books 2 and 10, a single individual cannot sleep. In Book 9, the whole Achaean army remains awake, but once the simile is complete the focus shifts to an individual, Agamemnon, who is of course the same sleepless individual being described in Book 10. The heightened emotional situation in Books 9 and 10 leads to a simile describing that state. If we postulate that Books 9 and 10 are possible multiforms of one another (see above, p. 13), each introducing an alternative narrative that encompasses the same dramatic night, then it is illuminating to note that they begin in much the same way, following a traditional pattern that expresses anxiety or fear and the resultant sleeplessness as a prelude to nighttime action. This pattern seems to be related, though not identical, to descriptions of the cognitive process that leads to a decision being made (characterized by the verb μερμηρίζειν, as in <em>Iliad</em> 2.3 and also on 10.503 below, on which see Arend 1933:106–115) and/or a plan being formulated, for which we find the use of the word βουλή at both <em>Iliad</em> 2.5 and 10.17. (See also <em>Iliad</em> 9.75 and testimonium 1 of the <em>Cypria</em> [Bernabé] and below on 10.43–44 and 10.302.) It is instructive to compare the beginning of Book 24, where Achilles, unlike the other Greeks, cannot sleep because of his grief. There, no plan is being formulated, and the scene makes use of virtually none of the formulaic language that we find in 2, 9, and 10. This suggests that, as Lord has argued on the basis of comparative evidence, formulas are closely tied to particular themes (Lord 1960/2000:49). (For further analysis of the relationship between Books 2 and 10, as well as 1 and 9, see Haft 1990 and above, “The Poetics of Ambush”).</p><p>Although Achilles’ sleeplessness in Book 24 does not follow the pattern that we have traced in Books 2, 9, and 10, there is a compressed version of the theme in Book 24, in which Hermes, like Zeus in Book 2, does not sleep as he ponders how to help a mortal. This theme appears after Priam has gone stealthily into the Achaean encampment to supplicate Achilles and ransom Hektor’s corpse. After Achilles has agreed both to ransom the corpse and to enforce a cease-fire so that a funeral for Hektor may be held, Priam and his herald go to sleep in the forecourt (<em>prodomos</em>) of Achilles’ shelter, while Hermes, who escorted Priam to the Achaean encampment, ponders how to get him home safely:</p><p>οἳ μὲν ἄρ’ ἐν προδόμῳ δόμου αὐτόθι κοιμήσαντο</p><p>κῆρυξ καὶ Πρίαμος πυκινὰ φρεσὶ μήδε’ ἔχοντες,</p><p>675  αὐτὰρ Ἀχιλλεὺς εὗδε μυχῷ κλισίης ἐϋπήκτου·</p><p>τῷ δὲ Βρισηῒς παρελέξατο καλλιπάρῃος.</p><p>ἄλλοι μέν ῥα θεοί τε καὶ ἀνέρες ἱπποκορυσταὶ</p><p>εὗδον παννύχιοι μαλακῷ δεδμημένοι ὕπνῳ·</p><p>ἀλλ’ οὐχ Ἑρμείαν ἐριούνιον ὕπνος ἔμαρπτεν</p><p>680  ὁρμαίνοντ’ ἀνὰ θυμὸν ὅπως Πρίαμον βασιλῆα</p><p>νηῶν ἐκπέμψειε λαθὼν ἱεροὺς πυλαωρούς.</p><p>στῆ δ’ ἄρ’ ὑπὲρ κεφαλῆς καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν·</p><p>ὦ γέρον οὔ νύ τι σοί γε μέλει κακόν, οἷον ἔθ’ εὕδεις</p><p>ἀνδράσιν ἐν δηΐοισιν, ἐπεί σ’ εἴασεν Ἀχιλλεύς.</p><p>685  καὶ νῦν μὲν φίλον υἱὸν ἐλύσαο, πολλὰ δ’ ἔδωκας·</p><p>σεῖο δέ κε ζωοῦ καὶ τρὶς τόσα δοῖεν ἄποινα</p><p>παῖδες τοὶ μετόπισθε λελειμμένοι, αἴ κ’ Ἀγαμέμνων</p><p>γνώῃ σ’ Ἀτρεΐδης, γνώωσι δὲ πάντες Ἀχαιοί.</p><p>ὣς ἔφατ’, ἔδεισεν δ’ ὃ γέρων, κήρυκα δ’ ἀνίστη.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 24.673–689</p><p>They there in the forecourt of the home bedded down,</p><p>the herald and Priam having schemes one after the other [<em>pukina</em>] in their minds.</p><p>675  But Achilles was sleeping in the inner room of the well-built tent,</p><p>and fine-cheeked Briseis lay next to him.</p><p>The rest of the gods and the men who wear horse-hair helmets [= <em>Iliad</em> 2.1]</p><p>slept all night long, overcome by gentle sleep [= <em>Iliad</em> 10.2],</p><p>but not Hermes the helper—sleep did not lay hold of him</p><p>680  as he pondered in his heart how king Priam</p><p>he would send back from the ships without the sacred guards of the gate noticing.</p><p>He stood over his head and addressed words to him:</p><p>“Old man, now no evil is a concern to you, seeing how you sleep</p><p>among enemy men, since Achilles allowed you to.</p><p>685  And now you have ransomed your dear son, and you have given much.</p><p>But to get you back alive they would give even three times as much,</p><p>those sons of yours whom you left behind, if Agamemnon</p><p>the son of Atreus were to recognize you, and all the Achaeans recognize you.”</p><p>So he spoke, and the old man was afraid and he got the herald up.</p><p>We find the same traditional language in 24.677–678 as we see in <em>Iliad</em> 2.1 and <em>Iliad</em> 10.2, respectively. One god or mortal is sleepless while everyone else rests. We do not find the term βουλή here as we do in Books 2 and 10, but we do have the verb ὁρμαίνω at 24.680 to indicate the formulation of a plan. The same verb is used at 10.4, as Agamemnon ponders many things in a state of sleeplessness. The astonishing situation in which this theme appears (that is, Priam sleeping among the enemy and needing to get out without the guards noticing or anyone recognizing him) may also have more in common with the plan that is ultimately formulated here in Book 10, an infiltration of the enemy camp. In other words, Hermes ponders how to achieve the all-important return to one’s own camp. Priam’s secret expedition to Achilles has much in common with the theme of a spying mission, including the need for stealth, the eluding of guards, and danger in general. If Priam is caught, Hermes tells him, he will need to be ransomed just as he ransomed Hektor from the enemy. We can compare this exchange to Dolon’s offer that his father will ransom him, which he makes to Diomedes and Odysseus after they have captured him (see below on 10.378–381). The thematic association between Priam’s situation and other nighttime missions for spying or ambush may help us to better understand 24.674, where Priam and his herald are described as “having schemes one after another in their minds.” Though it is Hermes who comes up with the plan and ensures their safe homecoming, the words πυκινὰ and μήδεα are so associated with this kind of action (see below on 10.5–9) that Priam and the herald are credited with them even though they go to sleep in the middle of their mission (cf. <em>Iliad</em> 24.282 for the use of this same phrase at the beginning of their mission). For a discussion of the poetic implications of other instances of the word <em>pukinos</em> in <em>Iliad</em> 24 see Lynn-George 1988:230–233 and 240.</p>

# Iliad 10.3

<p>Ἀτρείδην Ἀγαμέμνονα ποιμένα λαῶν </p><p>The epithet ποιμένα λαῶν ‘shepherd of the warriors’ is used most often of Agamemnon, to whom it is applied twelve times in the <em>Iliad</em> and three times in the <em>Odyssey</em>. But the phrase is also used of Nestor (three times in the <em>Iliad</em>; three in the <em>Odyssey</em>), Menelaos (two times in the <em>Iliad</em>; one in the <em>Odyssey</em>), and a number of other heroes, including Diomedes, Hektor (see on 10.406), and, in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus. The traditional epithet is the subject of the first of Milman Parry’s two doctoral theses published in 1928, theses which would revolutionize Homeric studies. Parry’s early work on the Homeric poems focuses on the traditional nature of the diction. <em>L’Épithète traditionelle dans Homère; Essaie sur un problème de style homérique </em>(= <em>The Traditional Epithet in Homer</em>) does not propose that the Homeric poems were composed orally, but theorizes that their traditional diction was the result of a system that had developed over a long period of time. Parry demonstrates both the utility of noun-epithet combinations in the composition of hexameter verse and the economy of Homeric diction, which rarely has more than one way of conveying what Parry calls “an essential idea” in the same metrical configuration. The principle of economy is so pervasive that Agamemnon can be called “shepherd of the warriors” even in instances where his leadership is not being stressed. This type of epithet is what Parry calls “ornamental” (MHV 21, 123–127). Since the epithet is applied to multiple heroes, it is also in Parry’s terms a generic epithet (MHV 64, 84–95). With respect to generic epithets, Parry says that the quality they express is one associated with heroes in general, rather than a hero in particular, and that the language is traditional and thus has a larger meaning for a traditional audience (MHV 137–138). Albert Lord has expanded on that idea: “The tradition feels a sense of meaning in the epithet, and thus a special meaning is imparted to the noun and to the formula … I would prefer to call it the traditionally intuitive meaning” (1960/2000:66; see also below on 10.144).</p><p>Therefore we need not make a choice between Parry’s groundbreaking revelations about the workings of Homeric diction and our appreciation of the beauty of this highly compressed metaphor, which names Agamemnon with reference to his role as the leader of the Achaean forces at Troy. As Parry’s student Albert Lord later shows, singers working within an oral composition-in-performance tradition can expand and compress their narratives under the influence of variety of factors. (See especially Lord 1960/2000:99–123.) In Homeric poetry, noun-epithet combinations are the ultimate compression of a hero’s story. (See Nagy 1990b: “A distinctive epithet is like a small theme song that conjures up a thought-association with the traditional essence of an epic figure, thing, or concept” [23], as well as Danek 2002:6.) For a traditional audience, these phrases conjure not just the present use but all previous performances, imbuing the language with what John Foley has discussed as “traditional referentiality” and “immanent art” (see especially Foley 1991 and 1999): “‘Grey-eyed Athena’ and ‘wise Penelope’ are thus neither brilliant attributions in unrelated situations nor mindless metrical fillers of last resort. Rather they index the characters they name, in all their complexity, not merely in one given situation or even poem but against an enormously larger traditional backdrop” (Foley 1999:18). Similarly, the metaphor of the shepherd is part of a traditional system of expanded associations whose more expanded implications are evoked even in this extremely compressed usage. (See Muellner 1990 and Edwards 1991:48–55.) For more on Parry’s work on generic epithets, see our extended discussion of them in connection with the epithet βοὴν ἀγαθός at 10.283.</p><p>This particular traditional metaphor of the shepherd juxtaposes, as we so often find in Homeric similes, peaceful pastoral life and war. When the epithet is used of Agamemnon and other heroes, it places them in a category of warriors who are also leaders and rulers. When we consider the poetics of shepherds from traditional Homeric similes, we can see that the metaphor emphasizes their responsibility to the warriors who follow them. Note, as an interesting contrast, that the dream that Zeus sends to Agamemnon in Book 2 tells him that a man who is responsible for the <em>laoi</em> and has so many concerns should not sleep all night long (2.24–25), while here that same shepherd of the <em>laoi</em> is indeed lying awake and cannot sleep.</p><p>By bringing their leadership into focus, this epithet also connects the heroes to other war narratives in which they play the leadership role. We can see why Agamemnon’s position as overall leader of the coalition at Troy attracts this particular formula twelve times in the <em>Iliad</em>. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, a poem that holds Agamemnon up as a negative exemplum for Odysseus throughout its narrative, the formula is only used of Agamemnon three times, and in all three of those cases Agamemnon is being remembered in his role as the leader of Achaean forces at Troy. Used of Diomedes, the epithet likely evoked for an ancient audience his role in the capture of Thebes as one of the <em>Epigonoi</em>; when it is used of Nestor, an association is made to the battles of the past that Nestor himself narrates at various points in the poem (see e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 11.668ff.). In this way the epithet has both paradigmatic significance, in that it places the hero in the category of leader, and syntagmatic meaning, in that it connects to specific expanded narratives about the hero in the larger epic tradition. (For more on the terms paradigmatic and syntagmatic, see Dué 2002:5–13.)</p>

# Iliad 10.5-9

<p>ὡς δ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἂν ἀστράπτῃ πόσις Ἥρης ἠϋκόμοιο/…/ὡς πυκὶν᾽ ἐν στήθεσσιν ἀνεστενάχιζ᾽ Ἀγαμέμνων </p><p>This simile has been condemned by previous editors as bad poetry and used as evidence that Book 10 was composed by an inferior poet. In his 1900 commentary, Leaf calls various aspects of the simile “so confused as to be practically unintelligible,” “a pointless comparison,” “turgid and tasteless,” and “an incompetent piece of expression.” Much more recently Hainsworth calls it “overstretched, to say the least” and “the first example of much strained thought and language in this book” (Hainsworth 1993 ad 10.5–9). In many ways, the response to this simile is emblematic of previous approaches to Book 10 as a whole. The arguments made in the introductory essays of this volume as to why a new approach to Book 10 is necessary are especially applicable here. The prominent position of the simile in this book and its highly compressed structure, which, like so many Homeric similes, defies traditional literary criticism, make it an ideal test case for the approach we have taken in this commentary.</p><p>Similes can teach us a great deal about the system in which our <em>Iliad</em> was composed. Although similes were once thought to be some of the latest, least traditional passages in the poem, drawn from the poet’s real world experiences (see e.g. Shipp 1972:7–144 and 208–222), we now know that this view is incorrect. The similes within epics, like the stories they narrate, have been shown to be traditional and to carry traditional associations that go far beyond the mere words of the similes themselves. (See Notopoulos 1957, Scott 1974, Moulton 1977, Muellner 1990, Martin 1997, and Tsagalis 2008:272–285, as well as Fränkel 1921 and Coffey 1957.) Often in epic we find very compressed similes whose fuller meaning would have been obvious to an audience raised in the tradition. A good example is the description of Hektor at <em>Iliad</em> 13.754–755: “He then sped onward, like a snowy mountain, and with a loud cry flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies” (ἦ ῥα, καὶ ὁρμήθη ὄρεϊ νιφόεντι ἐοικὼς/κεκλήγων, διὰ δὲ Τρώων πέτετ’ ἠδ’ ἐπικούρων). Mountains and snowstorms have particular associations, some of which are common to our culture, some which are not. For mountains, there is of course the association of height. But what are we to make of the adjective ‘snowy’? One possibility is that elsewhere in epic the flashing of armor is compared to the light reflecting off falling snowflakes, an association that would not perhaps come immediately to our minds. (See Janko 1992 ad 13.754–755 and <em>Iliad</em> 19.357ff.) But Edward Bradley (1967) has explored all references to snow in epic and found that the quality most often associated with it is “incessant movement,” a phrase that aptly describes Hektor in <em>Iliad</em> 13. So while for us the idea of comparing a quickly striding Hektor to a snowy mountain is almost comical, for an ancient audience the simile, compressed as it is, would no doubt have made perfect sense. It would have been part of a more expanded set of associations with snow and mountains but also more expanded versions of the same simile. So while we have to reconstruct those associations, an ancient audience would have made them effortlessly while listening to the performance. An ancient commentator called the effect of this comparison “savage and fearsome” and something about it must have struck Virgil, who adapts the simile in <em>Aeneid</em> 12.699ff.</p><p>Combined with the snowy mountain metaphor is another one, that of a bird in attack mode: “with a loud cry he flew through the ranks of the Trojans and their allies.” Leonard Muellner has examined this second part of the simile as an example of the way that epic similes and metaphors operate within an expanded system of associations. By comparing this particular instance of bird imagery (“with a loud cry” and “flew”) to other bird similes in related contexts, Muellner is able to show that the narrator is drawing on conventional imagery depicting the rapid movements of mustering warriors and their horses—imagery that we can now see pairs well with a comparison to snow. (See Muellner 1990:68n19.)</p><p>The traditionality of these similes and metaphors, which are themselves micronarratives within the larger narrative of the poem, allows them to operate in a very different way from similes in the poetry of our literate, text-based culture. For interpreting Homeric similes, we are not restricted to the printed page as we try to elicit the implications of a metaphor—we have the whole of Homeric poetry and even beyond to guide us. If we return now to the simile that opens Book 10, how can we use the corpus of Homeric poetry to understand what significance it might have summoned for an ancient audience?</p><p>The idea being conveyed by the simile is the frequency of Agamemnon’s expressions of sorrow (ἀναστενάχιζ’, 10.9), which are <em>pukina</em> (πυκίν’, 10.9). The verb ἀναστεναχίζω is related to other verbs of lament. In <em>Iliad</em> 23.211, Iris describes Patroklos as “the one whom all the Achaeans are bewailing” (Πάτροκλος, τὸν πάντες ἀναστενάχουσιν Ἀχαιοί; see also <em>Iliad</em> 18.315 and 18.355). στενάχω is the verb that describes what Achilles, having just learned of Patroklos’ death, is doing when his mother finds him in <em>Iliad</em> 18.70, and it is also used for the antiphonal cries of mourners who respond to the solo lamenters at <em>Iliad</em> 19.301 and 24.746.</p><p>The cries of grief that accompany songs of lamentation are pukina because they come thick and fast, one close upon the next. In <em>Iliad</em> 18.318, Achilles’ expressions of grief (στενάχων) for Patroklos are πυκνὰ, and, similarly, in <em>Iliad</em> 19.312 Achilles is described as grieving in a <em>pukinos</em> way (πυκινῶς ἀκαχήμενον). Sorrow in overwhelming abundance can also be thought of as <em>pukina</em>. In <em>Iliad</em> 16.599, πυκινὸν ἄχος takes hold of the Achaeans when Bathykles is killed. In <em>Odyssey</em> 19.516–517, Penelope speaks of the πυκιναὶ […] μελεδῶναι that torment her as she weeps (ὀδυρομένην, Odyssey 19.517). The adjective <em>pukinos</em> has a variety of meanings in Homer, all of which are linked by the idea of frequency, density, or closeness. One of the most common contexts for the adjective is in the natural world, where it describes the lairs of animals or places where animals hide. While a connection between natural hiding places for animals and the frequency of one’s cries might not seem elegant or logical, the adjective <em>pukinos</em> seems to link the two meanings so closely that it is difficult to ascertain which meaning is the primary one in the two extended descriptions of lament mentioned above. If we look at these passages more closely, we find that in both cases the adjective <em>pukinos</em> is elaborated upon by way of a simile.</p><p>In <em>Iliad</em> 18, the frequency of Achilles’ cries are compared to the grief of a lion who discovers that his cubs have been killed by a hunter:</p><p>αὐτὰρ Ἀχαιοὶ</p><p>315  παννύχιοι Πάτροκλον ἀνεστενάχοντο γοῶντες.</p><p>τοῖσι δὲ Πηλεΐδης ἁδινοῦ ἐξῆρχε γόοιο</p><p>χεῖρας ἐπ᾽ ἀνδροφόνους θέμενος στήθεσσιν <strong>ἑταίρου</strong></p><p><strong>πυκνὰ</strong> μάλα στενάχων ὥς τε λὶς ἠϋγένειος,</p><p>ᾧ ῥά θ᾽ ὑπὸ σκύμνους ἐλαφηβόλος ἁρπάσῃ ἀνὴρ</p><p>320 <strong> ὕλης ἐκ πυκινῆς</strong><em>·</em> ὃ δέ τ᾽ ἄχνυται ὕστερος ἐλθών,</p><p>πολλὰ δέ τ᾽ ἄγκε᾽ ἐπῆλθε μετ᾽ ἀνέρος ἴχνι᾽ ἐρευνῶν</p><p>εἴ ποθεν ἐξεύροι<em>·</em> μάλα γὰρ δριμὺς χόλος αἱρεῖ<em>·</em></p><p>ὣς ὃ βαρὺ στενάχων μετεφώνεε Μυρμιδόνεσσιν</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 18.314–323</p><p>On the other side the Achaeans</p><p>315  all night long bewailed Patroklos, lamenting.</p><p>And among them the son of Peleus led off the ceaseless lamentation,</p><p>placing his man-slaying hands on the chest of his companion</p><p>with wails <strong>that came thick and fast</strong>, like a well-bearded lion</p><p>whose cubs a man who is a deer hunter has snatched away</p><p>320  <strong>from the thick woods</strong>. He grieves when he later returns</p><p>and he comes to many valleys searching after the tracks of the man,</p><p>if somewhere he can find him, since piercing fury takes hold of him.</p><p>So wailing deeply [Achilles] spoke among the Myrmidons.</p><p>On a conceptual level the comparison being made is between the grief of Achilles and the lion, but what unites the tenor and vehicle on a verbal level is the word <em>pukinos</em>, used in the simile of the woods in which both the hunter and lion lurk.</p><p>The association made between these two semantic realms of the same word occurs in the same way in <em>Odyssey</em> 19:</p><p>“ξεῖνε, τὸ μέν σ᾽ ἔτι τυτθὸν ἐγὼν εἰρήσομαι αὐτή<em>·</em></p><p>510  καὶ γὰρ δὴ κοίτοιο τάχ᾽ ἔσσεται ἡδέος ὥρη,</p><p>ὅν τινά γ᾽ ὕπνος ἕλοι γλυκερός, καὶ κηδόμενόν περ.</p><p>αὐτὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ πένθος ἀμέτρητον πόρε δαίμων<em>·</em></p><p>ἤματα μὲν γὰρ τέρπομ᾽ ὀδυρομένη, γοόωσα,</p><p>ἔς τ᾽ ἐμὰ ἔργ᾽ ὁρόωσα καὶ ἀμφιπόλων ἐνὶ οἴκῳ<em>·</em></p><p>515  αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν νὺξ ἔλθῃ, ἕλῃσί τε κοῖτος ἅπαντας,</p><p>κεῖμαι ἐνὶ λέκτρῳ, πυκιναὶ δέ μοι ἀμφ᾽ ἀδινὸν κῆρ</p><p><strong>ὀξεῖαι μελεδῶναι ὀδυρομένην ἐρέθουσιν</strong></p><p>ὡς δ᾽ ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρη, χλωρηῒς ἀηδών,</p><p>καλὸν ἀείδῃσιν ἔαρος νέον ἱσταμένοιο,</p><p>520  δενδρέων <strong>ἐν πετάλοισι καθεζομένη πυκινοῖσιν</strong>,</p><p>ἥ τε θαμὰ τρωπῶσα χέει πολυηχέα φωνήν,</p><p>παῖδ᾽ ὀλοφυρομένη Ἴτυλον φίλον.”</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 19.509–522</p><p>“Stranger, I for my part would like to speak to you a little further.</p><p>510  For indeed soon will be the hour for going to bed, a pleasant thing,</p><p>at least for anyone whom sweet sleep takes hold of despite their cares.</p><p>As for me, a <em>daimon</em> has given immeasurable sorrow.</p><p>I spend my days delighting in mourning, lamenting,</p><p>as I look to my tasks and attend to the household.</p><p>515  But when night comes, and bedtime takes hold of all,</p><p>I lie in my bed, <strong>while thick and fast in my heart without end</strong></p><p><strong>sharp sorrows torment me as I weep</strong>,</p><p>as when the daughter of Pandareos, the vibrant nightingale,</p><p>sings a beautiful song when spring is newly arrived,</p><p>520  <strong>sitting among the thick leaves</strong> of the trees,</p><p>and she pours forth her resounding voice in one song after another,</p><p>lamenting her beloved child Itylus.”</p><p>Once again the frequency of one’s sobs and cries are compared by way of a simile to an animal in its haunts—in this case, the nightingale sings from amidst the dense foliage of trees. And much as in the description of Achilles, the point of comparison is the lamentation of Penelope and the sorrowful song of the nightingale, but what links tenor and vehicle verbally is the adjective <em>pukinos</em>.</p><p>We will return to the idea of the lair momentarily. For the moment though, let us note that here Penelope describes the impossibility of sleep when one is troubled by sorrows, a situation that matches the opening of <em>Iliad</em> 10. So too at the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 9, no one is sleeping, including Agamemnon, who is “struck in his heart by great sorrow” (ἄχεϊ μεγάλῳ βεβολημένος ἦτορ, <em>Iliad</em> 9.9). He calls an assembly, and when he begins speaking he is crying:</p><p>ἵστατο δάκρυ χέων ὥς τε κρήνη μελάνυδρος</p><p>ἥ τε κατ᾽ αἰγίλιπος πέτρης δνοφερὸν χέει ὕδωρ·</p><p>ὣς ὃ βαρὺ στενάχων ἔπε᾽ Ἀργείοισι μετηύδα</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9.14–16</p><p>He stood shedding a tear, like a spring whose water flows up from the depths,</p><p>a spring which pours dark water down from a steep rock,</p><p>so wailing deeply he addressed words to the Argives.</p><p>This passage recalls the iconic lamenter of Greek myth, Niobe, whose example is invoked by Achilles as he and Priam mourn for fathers and sons in lament-filled <em>Iliad</em> 24. Niobe in her grief for her twelve children was transformed into just such a weeping rock. (For more on Niobe as the prototypical lamenting woman in the <em>Iliad,</em> see Dué 2002:108–109, and on the metaphor of the spring, see Dué 2006a:160–161.)</p><p>We do not find the word <em>pukinos</em> in the initial similes of <em>Iliad</em> 9, as we saw in <em>Iliad</em> 18 and <em>Odyssey</em> 19, but these similes share with <em>Iliad</em> 10 their use of the diction, metaphors, and imagery of lament in their depiction of the sorrow of the Greeks (especially Agamemnon) and their resultant sleeplessness.[1] An explanation for the absence of the concept in <em>Iliad</em> 9, but its presence in <em>Iliad</em> 10, we argue, can be found in yet another semantic aspect of <em>pukinos</em>—its association with the <em>lokhos</em> ‘ambush’. The phrase πυκινὸν λόχον is found three times in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> (<em>Iliad</em> 4.392, 24.779; <em>Odyssey</em> 11.525). Ambush warfare is <em>pukinos</em> because of the cunning involved, and in fact cunning thoughts or schemes are <em>mēdea pukna</em> in Homeric epic. In <em>Iliad</em> 3, Helen describes Odysseus as the master of this kind cunning: οὗτος δ᾽ αὖ Λαερτιάδης πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς … εἰδὼς παντοίους τε δόλους καὶ μήδεα πυκνά (“That is the son of Laertes Odysseus who is crafty in many ways … he knows all sorts of tricks and schemes one after the other,” <em>Iliad</em> 3.200–202). Odysseus, as Helen’s description implies, is our ambush hero par excellence. (Like cunning schemes, shrewd counsel is also <em>pukinos</em>. See below on 10.43–44.)</p><p>Later in <em>Iliad</em> 10 the plan that Hektor proposes to the Trojans (namely, to send a spy to the Achaean camp) is called a πυκινὴν … βουλήν (10.302). (For similar phraseology used in Book 2 of Agamemnon’s testing of the troops, see above, pp. 231–235.) As was noted above (see “The Poetics of Ambush”), ambush warfare is characterized by <em>mētis</em>, while the <em>polemos</em> is characterized by <em>biē</em>. For another collocation of <em>pukinos</em>, cunning, and ambush, we have the ambush of Bellerophon as it is described in <em>Iliad</em> 6:</p><p>τῷ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἀνερχομένῳ <strong>πυκινὸν δόλον</strong> ἄλλον ὕφαινε<em>·</em></p><p>κρίνας ἐκ Λυκίης εὐρείης φῶτας ἀρίστους</p><p>εἷσε <strong>λόχον</strong><em>·</em> τοὶ δ᾽ οὔ τι πάλιν οἶκον δὲ νέοντο<em>·</em></p><p>πάντας γὰρ κατέπεφνεν ἀμύμων Βελλεροφόντης.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 6.187–190</p><p>But for him as he was going back he wove another <strong>close trick</strong>.</p><p>He selected the best men from broad Lycia</p><p>and sent them on an <strong>ambush</strong>. These men did not return back home:</p><p>Faultless Bellerophon slew them all.</p><p>One other element seen here (encapsulated in ἄλλον ‘another’) is that ambush is often used when other means to defeat the enemy have not worked. The king of Lycia has not been able to kill Bellerophon by sending him on various missions or into battle, so he resorts to ambush. A similar sense of desperation drives the plan formed here in <em>Iliad</em> 10.</p><p>Ambushes are <em>pukinos</em> for another reason as well, as we alluded to above: they involve hiding in dark, enclosed spaces, not unlike an animal’s lair. In the story of ambush that Odysseus tells Eumaios in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, Odysseus and his companions hide in the ῥωπήϊα πυκνά ‘dense shrubbery’ before the walls of Troy. Here, we return to the similes that elaborate on the grief of Achilles and Penelope. In both of those similes, the word <em>pukinos</em> describes the place in which the lamenting creature seeks refuge. In another passage in Odyssey 19, the idea of the lair and the place of ambush are directly equated. In the narrative that explains the origins of the scar that Eurykleia recognizes, we find out that on a hunting expedition Odysseus was ambushed by a boar, who rushed forth from a λόχμῃ πυκινῇ and gashed his leg (<em>Odyssey</em> 19.439).</p><p>Two things remain to be noted. First, it is also likely that ambushes are imagined as <em>pukinos</em> because of the density of the men hiding together in a cramped space. The episode of the wooden horse, the <em>lokhos</em> (as it is termed at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.277 and 8.515) that results in the sack of Troy, involves many men enclosed in a small space. In the ambush of Tydeus narrated at <em>Iliad</em> 4.391–398 (called a πυκινὸν λόχον in 4.392), fifty-two men lay in wait for him. Second, a crucial aspect of ambush warfare (which usually happens at night in the cover of darkness) is the necessity of not going to sleep. Staying awake at night in a cramped hiding place surrounded by other men in a closely packed fashion is precisely the kind of endurance ambush requires, and all of these components are encompassed by the adjective <em>pukinos</em>.</p><p>This exploration of the adjective <em>pukinos</em> suggests that the conceptual realms of lament and ambush can be merged in this word. In the simile that describes Agamemnon’s grief and sleeplessness, we find that there is no mention of an animal in his lair. Instead, the entire ambush episode that is about to unfold substitutes for such a simile, linked to Agamemnon’s sobs by the word <em>pukinos</em>. (For more on the traditional referentiality of the word <em>pukinos</em>, as used in the phrase <em>pukinon epos</em>, see Foley 1991:154–156.)</p><p>There are still more parts of the simile that can be unpacked, once we understand the traditional connection between lamentation and ambush and the idea of frequency or closeness that unites them. The frequency of the nightingale’s laments in <em>Odyssey</em> 19 (they come one right after another) is conveyed by the word θαμά at 19.521. The adjectival form of this word is used of snowflakes (as at <em>Iliad</em> 12.278) and, like <em>pukinos</em>, of projectiles (arrows, spears, and rocks) thrown in abundance and in quick succession. When Agamemnon’s cries are compared to falling snow, the traditional resonance of the simile can be understood by a traditional audience. Both are θαμά. Similarly, in <em>Iliad</em> 3.222, Odysseus’ persuasive words in the Trojan assembly are compared, in an extremely compressed simile, to snowflakes (νιφάδεσσιν ἐοικότα χειμερίῃσιν). For an audience on the inside of the tradition, this compressed simile would naturally draw on associations between the frequency and denseness of snowflakes and the close-packed nature of Odysseus’ <em>mēdea</em> (which are called <em>pukna</em> twenty lines before).</p><p>Possibly related to the metaphor world of snowflakes is the metaphor in <em>Iliad</em> 4.274, where the mass of warriors following the two Ajaxes is called a “cloud of foot-soldiers” (νέφος … πεζῶν). As Mark Edwards notes, the scholia on this line in several manuscripts explain that the metaphor is expressing the “denseness (τὸ πυκνὸν) and frightening aspect of the phalanx” by likening it to “a black and threatening cloud” (τὸ πυκνὸν καὶ καταπληκτικὸν τῆς φάλαγγος μιᾷ λέξει περιέλαβεν εἰκάσας μέλανι καὶ σκυθρωπῷ νέφει). (See Edwards 1991:48; the translation is his.) The lines following <em>Iliad</em> 4.274 actually go on to unpack the metaphor by way of a simile:</p><p>275  ὡς δ’ ὅτ’ ἀπὸ σκοπιῆς εἶδεν νέφος αἰπόλος ἀνὴρ</p><p>ἐρχόμενον κατὰ πόντον ὑπὸ Ζεφύροιο ἰωῆς·</p><p>τῷ δέ τ’ ἄνευθεν ἐόντι μελάντερον ἠΰτε πίσσα</p><p>φαίνετ’ ἰὸν κατὰ πόντον, ἄγει δέ τε λαίλαπα πολλήν,</p><p>ῥίγησέν τε ἰδών, ὑπό τε σπέος ἤλασε μῆλα·</p><p>280  τοῖαι ἅμ’ Αἰάντεσσι διοτρεφέων αἰζηῶν</p><p>δήϊον ἐς πόλεμον πυκιναὶ κίνυντο φάλαγγες</p><p>κυάνεαι, σάκεσίν τε καὶ ἔγχεσι πεφρικυῖαι.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 4.275–282</p><p>275  As when a goat-herding man sees from a lookout point a cloud</p><p>coming over the sea, driven by the rush of the West wind,</p><p>and to him being at a distance blacker than pitch</p><p>it appears as it comes over the sea, and it brings a great tempest,</p><p>and seeing it he shudders, and drives his flocks into a cave,</p><p>280  such were the young men nurtured by Zeus who were with the Ajaxes,</p><p>dense phalanxes moving into hostile war,</p><p>dark, bristling with shields and spears.</p><p>Here a single word, “cloud,” elicits an extended simile that conveys denseness by conjuring the image of a closely packed phalanx. But in what way is a cloud dense? If the simile were not present in our text, and we had only the compressed metaphor of <em>Iliad</em> 4.274, we might doubt the scholiast’s interpretation. The key must be in the rain portended by the νέφος, which like hail or snow or Agamemnon’s sighs—or indeed battle—is <em>pukinos</em>. This passage from <em>Iliad</em> 4 allows us to see the richness of this tradition, whose metaphors can be so highly compressed yet full of meaning for a traditional audience. So also does the adjective ἀθέσφατον, used to describe hail in 10.6, have traditional associations, in this case with abundance, but used elsewhere in Homer of rain, food, wine, and, most interesting for us, long winter nights (see <em>Odyssey</em> 11.373 and 15.392).</p><p>Finally, as Hainsworth has pointed out in his discussion of these lines, the phrase “the great jaws of destructive battle” (πτολέμοιο μέγα στόμα πευκεδανοῖο, 10.8) is a perfectly traditional metaphor (we can compare <em>Iliad</em> 19.313 and 20.359), but it is “unexpected as an alternative to rain, hail, or snow” (Hainsworth 1993 ad 10.8). The adjective πευκεδανός is found nowhere else in the archaic epic that survives, but the image, we submit, is unexpected and strained only for us—not for a traditional audience, for whom long-range connections of the kind we have argued for here are made on a subconscious level. Such connections are only possible within a traditional system, participated in by both performer and audience, in which meaning becomes possible with reference to the tradition. To put it another way, this simile only makes sense if we read it against the backdrop of the tradition in which it was created. It can be highly compressed because every word has resonance that links it to the other uses of that word in the tradition. Such a simile cannot be the work of an idiosyncratic poet trying to manipulate the oral tradition into a new, original style, as Danek, for example, has argued (see Danek 1988 and above, “Interpreting <em>Iliad</em> 10”), nor can we agree with Hainsworth that the metaphor we have just cited is “further instance of the pretentious usage of traditional language characteristic of this Book” (Hainsworth 1993 <em>ad</em> 10.8). In the system that created the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>—including, we are arguing, <em>Iliad</em> 10—the poet does not make use of tradition in an artificial way. When confronted with such a formulation on the part of scholars hostile to Iliad 10, it is instructive to consider the words of Albert Lord, who asserts that we must understand the poet to be working “inside an oral tradition of epic song”:</p><p>He is not an outsider approaching the tradition with only a superficial grasp of it, using a bit here and a bit there, or trying to present a “flavor” of the traditional, yet ever thinking in terms that are essentially different from it. He is not a split personality with half of his understanding in the tradition and the other half in a parnassus of literate methods. No, he is not even “immersed” in the tradition. He is the tradition.</p><p>Lord 1960/2000:147</p><p>[1] We may contrast the similes that describe the anxiety and sorrow of the Greeks at the start of Books 9 and 10 with the one at the end of Book 8 that describes the campfires of the Trojans as they make camp on the plain. The fires are compared to the stars on a windless, clear night (<em>Iliad</em> 8.555ff.; see Webster 1958:231–232). Scott (1974:51) notes that similes frequently occur at junctures in the narrative, and that those junctures often correspond with a change in theme, as is the case with the simile under discussion here at 10.5–9.</p>

# Iliad 10.10

<p>τρομέοντο  </p><p>Zenodotus, the first head of the library at Alexandria and a well-known Homer scholar, knew of the reading φοβέοντο here, according to the scholia that survive in our medieval manuscripts, but the reading is not attested elsewhere. (The verb τρομέω is likewise used in the middle voice at 10.492. See also <em>Iliad</em> 6.151.) Hainsworth (1993 <em>ad loc.</em>) notes that Aristarchus, a successor of Zenodotus as head of the library and rival editor of Homer, asserted that “φοβοῦμαι and its cognates signified flight,” whereas here φοβέοντο would have the Classical meaning ‘fear’. Hainsworth adds the qualification “but that [Aristarchus’] doctrine may not be binding on this Book.” Hainsworth’s comment reflects his understanding of <em>Iliad</em> 10 as likely a later composition than the rest of the <em>Iliad</em> (see “Interpreting <em>Iliad</em> 10”). We suggest instead that φοβέοντο’s lack of manuscript attestation indicates that it was not a particularly old or well-known version of the verse, but this is not necessarily indicative of the lateness of the entire book. A version with φοβέοντο may well have entered the formulaic performance language at a later phase in the Homeric tradition than τρομέοντο, eventually becoming part of the textual tradition known to Zenodotus several centuries later. The third-century CE Stoic philosopher Chrysippus (fragment 906 in the edition of von Arnim 1903) quotes this line with still another variation: περὶ γὰρ δίε νηυσὶν Ἀχαιῶν. This phrase is attested at <em>Iliad</em> 9.433 and 13.557 and is in no sense “un-Homeric,” though it, like φοβέοντο, is not attested here in the manuscript tradition. These variations highlight the dynamic nature of Homeric diction, which evolved through time and was in a constant state of flux in its early stages. For more on the Alexandrian editors of Homer see on 10.51–52 below. </p>

# Iliad 10.11-13

<p>Agamemnon sees and hears that the Trojans are also awake, and this fact is confirmed later at 10.299–300. These lines convey a nighttime sensory experience: Agamemnon can see the fires, and he marvels at their number, indicating his anxiety at how large the Trojan army seems. The noise he hears reinforces that anxiety. Agamemnon’s perception of the playing of music may make the Trojans seem more relaxed—they are not fearful for their destruction, at least in Agamemnon’s imagination. (The Trojans are portrayed as noisy in contrast to the silent Achaeans at <em>Iliad</em> 3.1–9, 4.429–438, later in Book 10, and elsewhere, so these lines may also reinforce that common characteristic.) Seeing and hearing the Trojan camp from Agamemnon’s perspective provides additional insight into the concerns that keep him sleepless. Sensory experiences in the dark call for interpretation in a way that daytime experiences do not: because the sense of sight is limited, the fires are visible, but Agamemnon cannot see any further detail that would let him know what is happening near those fires. Hearing becomes much more important at night, but at this point, what he hears only seems to tell Agamemnon that the Trojans are awake, and perhaps that they are relaxed. These perceptions combine to provide a contrast to the Achaean camp, which is silent now. One motivation for nighttime spying raids, as we will see in more detail below, is that each side is guessing what the other will do, and they send out spies to confirm those guesses. </p>

<p>μάχεσθαι  </p><p>With the use of this verb ‘to fight’, we can see that the anxiety is so great among the Achaeans that they fear large-scale attack, and not just a spying mission or an ambush. The fact that they have put seven hundred men on guard duty also reflects their concern that the Trojans will make an all-out assault at night. During the intense battle that occurs the following day, Agamemnon also wonders if the Trojans will stop fighting when night falls (<em>Iliad</em> 14.78–79). </p>

<p>Γερήνιος ἱππότα Νέστωρ</p><p>See Frame 2009 for an in-depth exploration of the epic tradition about Nestor and how it is encapsulated in the phrase <em>hippota Nestor</em>. That Frame could write a work of nearly 800 pages on the implications of this phrase in the epic tradition reveals just how much meaning can be encapsulated in a single epithet. (See also above on 10.3.) Of <em>gerēnios</em> Frame writes (2009:600n189):</p><p>In his separate epic traditions Nestor was a young man; only when Nestor was added to the saga of Troy was the figure of the old man created (cf. Cantieni 1942:87). The idea that at Troy Nestor operates among the third generation of heroes during his own lifetime is meant, I think, to establish a sharp divide between the aged Nestor (who is new) and the young Nestor (who is old); a middle-aged Nestor does not exist in epic as far as we know. It was perhaps to distinguish the old hero at Troy from the young hero in Pylos that the <em>hippóta Néstōr</em> of ancient Pylian fame became <em>Gerḗnios hippóta Néstōr</em> at Troy, if <em>Gerḗnios</em>, derived from <em>géras</em>, “privilege of the old,” simply means “old,” as forcefully argued by Bader 1980:55–56: note in particular <em>Iliad</em> 4.325, where Nestor, referring to his role as counselor and speaker (i.e. to his Homeric role in essence) says τὸ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ γερόντων, “for that is the privilege of the old”; a full and convincing morphological analysis of the derivation of <em>Gerḗnios</em> from <em>géras</em> has now been offered by Timothy Barnes in an unpublished paper delivered at the 2008 annual meeting of the American Philological Association.</p><p>The theory that <em>gerēnios</em> relates to the privileges of old age is strengthened by a notice in the Townley scholia to <em>Iliad</em> 16.196 that “some” have Γερήνιος ἱππότα Φοίνιξ in place of γέρων ἱππηλάτα Φοίνιξ. (Otherwise, the phrase is used exclusively of Nestor.)  </p>

<p>Ἰλιόθι πρὸ    </p><p>In a very early stage of the Greek language, prepositions were adverbs, and their placement is thus far more flexible in Homeric Greek than in Classical Greek. Here πρὸ is strictly adverbial. It is thought that tmesis, the separation of a prepositional prefix from its verb, ceased to be part of the spoken/written language before the Greek of the Linear B tablets (i.e. the thirteenth century BCE) but remained an important part of epic diction because of its deeply ingrained presence in the formulaic system and the flexibility it offered for the creation of new formulas (Horrocks 1997:201). The ending -θι of Ἰλιόθι is locative, a vestige of the Mycenaean Greek case system (attested in Linear B). (On the whole phrase see Chantraine 1988, <em>GH</em> I §112.) </p>

<p>πυρὰ πολλὰ τὰ καίετο  </p><p>These fires that Agamemnon wonders at now were ordered by Hektor to be set earlier in the evening (see <em>Iliad</em> 8.507–511). In his orders Hektor says that he wants the fires to burn all night long specifically so that he can see if the Achaeans are trying to sail away and thus escape the total destruction he wants to inflict on them. In other words, Hektor, too, is trying to see the enemy in the dark. It is this same motive that prompts Hektor to send a spy (see 10.311), and such details show continuity between the events of the narrative at the end of the day in earlier books and what happens here in Book 10. We also hear in <em>Iliad</em> 8.562–565 that the Trojans set a thousand fires, each of which has fifty men and their horses and chariots around it. We can therefore imagine the magnitude of the scene Agamemnon is gazing at here and understand why it inspires his anxiety.</p><p>Dan Petegorsky (1982:47ff., 179) argues that there is a connection between these fires and the “atmospheric activity of Zeus alluded to in the simile” at 10.5–9. Both are visible signs, he contends, of “Zeus’ hostility towards the Achaeans, concrete tokens of Hector’s threat to bring fire against the Achaean camp and ships” (Petegorsky 1982:179). In the interaction between simile and narrative that Petegorsky perceives, we can also add this divine dimension to Agamemnon’s fears. That is, the lightening of Zeus not only reflects the storminess of Agamemnon’s worried mind, but also represents a further reason for him to indeed be anxious on this night.</p>

# Iliad 10.18

<p>ἐλθέμεν is an Aeolic infinitive form (Chantraine 1988, GH I §237). Although the language of Homer is primarily Ionic in nature, Aeolic dialect forms make up a considerable percentage of Homeric diction. Before oral composition-in-performance and dialect diffusion were well understood, a considerable amount of scholarly effort was devoted to finding an explanation for the mix of dialects (see MHV 326–327). In the 1880s August Fick ignited Homeric scholarship by proposing that the <em>Iliad</em> was composed in Aeolic Greek and later translated by Ionic singers into their own dialect, and he even went so far as to produce editions of the <em>Iliad</em> (1886) and <em>Odyssey</em> (1883) with the Aeolic dialect restored everywhere possible. Approximately fifty years later Milman Parry theorized that the oral tradition had passed through several distinct historical phases, one of which was an Aeolic phase. He argued that just as singers in the Homeric tradition would have naturally replaced older forms with more current ones, where meter and other strongly felt patterns allowed, but retained them where they did not, so also did Ionic singers, inheriting an Aeolic epic song tradition, replace Aeolic forms everywhere possible, but retained them where the formulas could not easily be adapted in performance. (See especially MHV, and on the theory of an Aeolic phase, see also Palmer 1962, Hoekstra 1965, Janko 1982, and West 1988.) So here the change of ἐλθέμεν to ἐλθεῖν (which is attested at 10.56 and various other places in the <em>Iliad</em>) would result in a spondee in the fifth foot (generally avoided in Homer, though not impossible). More recently an alternative theory has been proposed, namely, that Aeolic and Ionic epic traditions coexisted after the end of Bronze Age, but the Aeolic tradition was eventually assimilated into and eclipsed by the Ionic tradition in Asia Minor. (On this complex question see the overview in Horrocks 1997.) In any case, certainly an Aeolic tradition of epic poetry did flourish at one time, as is evidenced by such poems as Sappho 44 (on which see West 1973:191, Nagy 1974:134–39, Horrocks 1997:200, and Dué 2002:59).</p>

<p>μῆτιν  </p><p>The plan that Agamemnon hopes Nestor will construct is called simply <em>mētis</em>. In <em>Iliad</em> 9.423, Achilles had in fact advised the Achaeans to come up with a “better <em>mētis</em>” (μῆτιν ἀμείνω), since he was not going to accept Agamemnon’s offer. The plan that Nestor devises is to send someone on a nighttime spying expedition. Night raids and ambush warfare are linked in the epic tradition by their use of cunning or trickery (<em>mētis</em>) and endurance of prolonged hardship as opposed to the outright brute force (<em>biē</em>) of the battlefield (Edwards 1985:18 and above, “The Poetics of Ambush”). Many of the ambushes that are mentioned in epic occur at night: see e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 21.34–39 and <em>Odyssey</em> 14.468–503. Diomedes will be the hero who volunteers for this particular raid (10.219ff.), and he chooses as his companion Odysseus (10.243), the hero of <em>mētis</em>-style warfare.

<p>ἔνδυνε περὶ στήθεσσι χιτῶνα  </p><p>Here begins the first dressing scene of the book, which, as we have argued above (see “The Poetics of Ambush”), signals to the audience an entry into the narrative world of the night raid/ambush. The animal skins and other unusual items that the heroes put on seem to be special features of this type of story, and serve a practical purpose as well. The skins and leather caps are the equivalent of camouflage, a necessary precaution in warfare of this type. (See also below on κυνέην, 10.257.) We can compare what Agamemnon puts on here to his dressing scene in <em>Iliad</em> 2.42–46, where, of course, no night raid will take place:</p><p>… μαλακὸν δ᾽ ἔνδυνε χιτῶνα</p><p>καλὸν νηγάτεον, περὶ δὲ μέγα βάλλετο φᾶρος<em>·</em></p><p>ποσσὶ δ᾽ ὑπὸ λιπαροῖσιν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,</p><p>ἀμφὶ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὤμοισιν βάλετο ξίφος ἀργυρόηλον<em>·</em></p><p>εἵλετο δὲ σκῆπτρον πατρώϊον ἄφθιτον αἰεὶ</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 2.42–46</p><p>He put on a soft <strong>khiton</strong>,</p><p>fine and newly made, and put around himself a great cloak.</p><p>Under his shining feet he fastened fine sandals</p><p>and around his shoulders he placed a silver-studded sword.</p><p>He took up the ancestral scepter which is always unwilting.</p><p>In <em>Iliad</em> 2, Agamemnon dresses for an assembly; in <em>Iliad</em> 10, he dresses for a night raid. Of course, ultimately it will be Diomedes and Odysseus who go on the raid, but this first dressing scene and those that follow set the stage for what is to come, signaling to the audience our entry into the narrative world of the night raid. (See also on 10.254–272.)</p><p>In this book, each hero dresses for a night raid, and each hero has his own particular outfit with no doubt its own particular associations in the tradition. (See Reinhardt 1961:247.) Each subsequent dressing scene (there are five) builds our anticipation for the expedition to come. Agamemnon here fittingly puts on the red-gold skin of a large lion, and it seems that, even apart from the resonance of so many lion similes in epic, Agamemnon and Mycenae were especially linked with lions. Several artifacts featuring lions, including the monumental gateway to the citadel, grave steles, seals, and ceremonial daggers, have been excavated at Mycenae. From the Classical period, we can compare the rich lion imagery and metaphors in Aeschylus’ <em>Oresteia</em> (see e.g. <em>Agamemnon</em> 716–736, 821–828, 1223–1226, 1258–1260, <em>Libation Bearers</em> 935–938). Nevertheless, other heroes do wear lion skins, including, in this book, Diomedes (10.177), but also, most famously, Herakles, who wears the skin of the Nemean lion obtained during the traditional first of his twelve labors.</p>

# Iliad 10.29

<p>παρδαλέῃ μὲν πρῶτα μετάφρενον εὐρὺ κάλυψε  </p><p>In this second of the dressing scenes, Menelaos puts on a leopard skin. Outside of Book 10, the only hero who wears an animal skin is Paris, who likewise wears a leopard skin at <em>Iliad</em> 3.17 when he makes his challenge to the Achaeans. In that encounter, Menelaos does not wear an animal skin, but it is telling that, in the same passage, Menelaos is compared in a simile to a lion that suddenly finds the body of an animal to eat (<em>Iliad</em> 3.23–26). Because of the way that duel comes to an end (Paris is ultimately whisked away to safety by Aphrodite), there is no chance for Menelaos to strip him and take the skin as spoils. Instead, Menelaos’ dressing scene here makes him parallel to Paris, Helen’s other husband. The two husbands have other common traits as well. As we will see below, Menelaos has a tendency to “give way” (10.121). This tendency is shared by this other younger brother of a leader (it is likewise his brother Hektor who describes Paris as one who gives way, <em>Iliad</em> 6.521–523). The connections between the two are a good example of what John Foley calls “traditional referentiality,” which is the kind of meaning made possible by tradition for an audience on the inside of that tradition.</p><p>We should also note that Paris, our other wearer of leopard skin, has associations with ambush. He fights even in daytime battle as an ambushing archer (in <em>Iliad</em> 11 he wounds Diomedes, Machaon, and Eurupylos with his arrows), and, as we have explored above (see pp. 57–61), archery and ambush are conceptually and even visually linked. On the alterity of archer figures, see also Lissarrague 1990:13–34. On attitudes toward archery in the <em>Iliad,</em> see also Farron 2003, who disputes Lorimer’s (1950:289–305) claim that archery is lower class and ineffective. In several (primarily late) accounts of Achilles’ death, Paris ambushes him in the sanctuary of Thymbraion when he comes, unarmed, to arrange his marriage to Polyxena. (See Dictys of Crete 3.2ff, Dares 27, Hyginus 110, and Philostratus <em>Heroikos</em> 51.1. with Burgess 1995.) These late sources may preserve a vestige of a tradition about Achilles’ death at the hands of Paris by archery and ambush. At the very least, surviving evidence (including what we know of the now lost <em>Aithiopis</em>) indicates that in Archaic myth Achilles died after receiving an arrow wound to the ankle (Burgess 1995:225). It may be that Paris’ leopard skin is an iconographic sign of his archer status (cf. Naiden 1999: “Like the leopard, archery is crucial yet marginal, inferior yet effective” [200]), and the overlap between the conceptual realms of archery and ambush warfare, which we have explored in detail in “The Poetics of Ambush,” might explain why Paris wears a leopard skin even in a non-ambush context.</p>

# Iliad 10.30-31

<p>αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ στεφάνην κεφαλῆφιν ἀείρας / θήκατο χαλκείην</p><p>Menelaos wears a helmet that is unsuited to a spying mission or ambush. It is bronze, which, as we hear about the spear points in Diomedes’ encampment, shines even through the dark of night (see 10.152–154). Such armament is a liability, therefore, to stealth and to remaining undetected in the dark (see more on 10.257). Diomedes, Odysseus, and Dolon all wear leather caps to protect their heads on these missions (10.257–259, 10.261–265, 10.335). Although Menelaos is involved in other ambushes within the epic tradition, this subtle detail of his chosen dress here may indicate to a traditional audience that Menelaos is not going to be chosen for this expedition. We may note the anxiety expressed in Agamemnon’s words to Diomedes about his choice of partner; the narrator explicitly states that Agamemnon was afraid for his brother Menelaos (see 10.237–240). In the <em>Odyssey</em>, however, Menelaos is portrayed as an ambusher: he is inside the Trojan Horse with Diomedes and Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.280), he is one of the leaders of the night mission Odysseus describes to Eumaios (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.470–471), and he successfully ambushes Proteus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.388–463; see above on pp. 72–73 for more on this ambush).</p>

<p>ποικίλῃ  </p><p>The leopard skin is further described as <em>poikilos</em>, which in this case has meaning for its physical qualities: the spotted pattern makes it “intricate.” But, as we saw with the wide semantic range of <em>pukinos</em>, which joins many concepts that might seem quite disparate at first to us, so also in the case of <em>poikilos</em> there is another important meaning here. As Detienne and Vernant (1974/1978) have shown, there is an association of this word with <em>mētis</em> and with trickery (“la ruse”). In this way, too, the leopard skin in particular shares common associations with ambush. For more on <em>mētis</em> and ambush, see above on 10.19 and below on 10.43–44.</p>

# Iliad 10.32

<p>βῆ δ᾽ ἴμεν  </p><p>This familiar Homeric expression is a good, straightforward example of a formula with a fixed metrical position. There is flexible variation within the formula: it can be expressed in the third-person singular, as here, as well as in the third-person plural (as at 10.297: βάν ῥ’ ἴμεν), and it can use either the conjuction δ’(ε) or the particle ῥ’(α). But in the more than thirty uses of all these permutations in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, the formula always begins the line, occupying the first foot. Thus this specific way of saying “he/she/they went/left” can be assumed to have been particularly useful at the beginning of the line for the singer as he composed in performance. The formula gains additional flexibility with the use of the later Aeolic infinitive form ἴμεναι (the Aeolic infinitive form ἴμεν is earlier), which extends the phrase into the second foot. We see that version of the formula at least fifteen times. Another version of the formula with the Ionic infinitive form ἰέναι (so either βῆ δ’/ῥ’ ἰέναι or βάν δ’/ῥ’ ἰέναι) likewise extends into the first syllable of the second foot, and this iteration shows up at least eighteen times in our texts: see examples at 10.136, 10.179, 10.273, and 10.336. The only case in which we see this phrase in a metrical position other than the initial position of the line is when it is part of a longer formula, an example of which we see at 10.73. In this longer formula (which also appears in <em>Iliad</em> 20.484 and <em>Iliad</em> 21.205), the line begins αὐτὰρ ὁ βῆ ῥ’ ἰέναι μετὰ and is completed by a name + epithet formula. This longer formula is used in cases of going after/for a specifically named person, while the various shorter versions can be used in a wide variety of situations of going, but always when the singer starts a new line. Because this formula is used seven times in <em>Iliad</em> 10, we can also see that many men are in motion during this night.</p>

# Iliad 10.41

<p>νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην  </p><p>We find night likewise described in 10.142. Ambrosia, the food of both the gods (see e.g. <em>Odyssey</em> 5.93, 5.199, 9.359) and their divine horses, is used by the gods for a variety of other purposes in Homer, including as perfume (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.445), as a cosmetic (<em>Iliad</em> 14.170), and as a preservative for the corpses of Sarpedon and Patroklos (<em>Iliad</em> 16.670 and 16.680, and 19.38). At <em>Iliad</em> 1.529, Zeus’ hair is described as <em>ambrosios</em>, as is sleep at 2.19. In <em>Iliad</em> 18.268 and 24.363, night is again ambrosial. There is, as we can see, a wide range of associations for this word.</p><p>In 10.83, 10.276, and 10.386, the metrically equivalent phrase νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is used in the same position in the line. (See also on 10.142 below and the textual commentaries above on 10.386.) This phrase has a spondee where ἀμβροσίην has a dactyl, but both phrases occupy the same metrical space. νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is also found at <em>Odyssey</em> 9.143 and the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 578. Although it is not impossible to have two metrically equivalent formulas expressing the same essential idea, such duplications are rare in Homer, so we should expect the two adjectives to convey different things. The context of νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην in <em>Odyssey</em> 9 is the ambush-like episode of the Cyclops (see above, “The Poetics of Ambush”), and its use of Hermes (whose nighttime thievery and cunning are celebrated in the <em>Homeric Hymn</em>) is likewise suggestive of an association between this word and nighttime escapades. Norman Austin (1975:71–73) sees ὀρφναίη as being particularly evocative of night’s darkness, which is of course appropriate for both ambush and thievery. Night is in general ambrosial, according to Austin, because of the welcome rest it brings at the end of the day, but it is particularly so in the <em>Iliad</em>: “Night [in the <em>Iliad</em>] means the end of a day’s fighting. It is relief from weary battle, but, more importantly for the Homeric hero, it means survival through another day.” But the night of <em>Iliad</em> 10 is marked by anxiety, fear, and a raid on the enemy camp, hence the appropriateness of νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην. (For alternate views on why night is ambrosial, see Hainsworth 1993 <em>ad</em> 10.41 and Heubeck, West, and Hainsworth 1988 <em>ad</em> 4.429, 4.445, and 5.93 with bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>)</p><p>Georg Danek (1988:80) has interpreted the alternation between the formulas νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην and νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην as an intentional variation on the part of the composer of this book. (On Danek’s arguments about the composer of <em>Iliad</em> 10, see “Interpreting <em>Iliad</em> 10.”) Danek views the attempt to vary traditional phraseology as a hallmark of this poet’s individual style. As we noted above, this approach is problematic from the standpoint of the methodology developed by Parry and Lord in studying oral traditions. It rests on the assumption that a singer within a traditional system would strive to “break free” of that tradition and compose in a new way. Austin’s approach is helpful, because it finds two different ways that night can be characterized and shows how context affects the choice of either formula. Throughout his 1975 work, however, Austin himself seeks to counter Parry’s demonstration of the economy of Homeric diction, and uses these words as an example of how the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> can achieve various literary goals, unconstrained by formulaic diction. But another way to look at it is to say that Austin’s account of the different conceptualizations of the night enhances and clarifies Parry’s arguments about the economy of Homeric diction, which Parry describes as “free of phrases which, having the same metrical value and expressing the same idea, could replace one another” (MHV 86). There is more than one way to say “night” here, because night is not a monolithic concept. When a poet wants to invoke night with its associations with relief and rest, νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην would be easily summoned. The night encompassed by <em>Iliad</em> 10, however, is of a different sort, and as a result, the formula νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is used three or four times. This interpretation seems strengthened by <em>Iliad</em> 24.363, which is identical to 10.83, with the exception of the formula for night:</p><p>τίς δ᾽ οὗτος κατὰ νῆας ἀνα στρατὸν ἔρχεαι οἶος</p><p>νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην, ὅτε θ᾽ εὕδουσι βροτοὶ ἄλλοι,</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 10.82–83</p><p>“Who is this that comes down to the ships through the encamped mass of warriors all alone</p><p>through the dark night, when other mortals are sleeping?”</p><p>πῇ πάτερ ὧδ’ ἵππους τε καὶ ἡμιόνους ἰθύνεις</p><p>νύκτα δι’ ἀμβροσίην, ὅτε θ’ εὕδουσι βροτοὶ ἄλλοι;</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 24.362–363</p><p>“Where, father, are you driving your horses and mules like this</p><p>through the ambrosial night, when the other mortals are sleeping?”</p><p>In <em>Iliad</em> 24, Priam is attempting to sneak into Achilles’ camp during the night undetected; the formula νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην would seem to be appropriate. (See above on 10.1ff. for more on how Priam’s journey has thematic associations with other nighttime missions to the enemy’s camp.) But the speaker of these lines is the disguised Hermes, talking to Priam in the form of a young man who should be unaware of Priam’s mission. Accordingly, he uses the more innocent-sounding and divine νύκτα δι’ ἀμβροσίην. Alternatively, we can interpret the absence of ὀρφναίην as significant within the system that generated the two formulas. As we have seen, the theme of the night raid/ambush attracts its own a subset of formulas, which are not typically found outside of this context in Homer. If Priam’s expedition to Achilles, though it takes place at night, is not being characterized as an ambush, night is therefore not dark, but the more generic “ambrosial.” (For more on Parry’s principle of economy and the attempts that have been made to refute its applicability to the Homeric epics, see the discussion below of Odysseus’ smile in 10.400.)</p>

# Iliad 10.43-52

<p>In these verses, Agamemnon worries about the partiality shown by Zeus to Hector. According to Agamemnon, Zeus favors Hector because of the <em>hiera</em> ‘sacrifices’ offered by that hero to the god, I.10.046, and Zeus shows his favor by letting Hector win against the Achaeans. That is why the Achaeans now need to devise a <em>boulē</em> in the specific sense of a clever ‘plan’, I.10.043, which is <em>kerdaleē</em> ‘crafty’, I.10.044—a plan that is crafty enough to counter the many baneful things that Hector will do to damage the Achaeans by way of his <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, I.10.048. The idea of ‘doing by way of <em>mētis</em>’ here at I.10.048 is expressed by the derivative verb <em>mētīesthai</em> (aorist <em>mētīsasthai</em>)—which is later picked up by the verb <em>mēdesthai</em> ‘devise’ at I.10.52, referring again to the many baneful things that Hector will do—or ‘devise’—against the Achaeans. You would think, adds Agamemnon, that Hector was the son of some god or of some goddess, I.10.050. This wording about Hector evokes the reality of an ongoing antagonism between the goddess Athena and the hero Hector. Already at I.07.047, the wording of the seer Helenos is referring to such a reality: Helenos addresses his brother Hector by describing him as comparable to the god Zeus himself with respect to Hector’s qualities of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, and the wording of this description is a direct affront to the divinity Athena, who is the very personification of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’.  </p>

# Iliad 10.43-44

<p>χρεὼ βουλῆς ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ … κερδαλέης</p><p>Here again we see a parallel with <em>Iliad</em> 9. Compare Nestor’s words at 9.74–76: πολλῶν δ’ ἀγρομένων τῷ πείσεαι ὅς κεν ἀρίστην/βουλὴν βουλεύσῃ· μάλα δὲ χρεὼ πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς/ἐσθλῆς καὶ πυκινῆς (“When many are gathered you can be persuaded to obey him who counsels the best plan. All of the Achaeans are especially in need of good, close [<em>pukinos</em>] counsel”). In 10.17, Agamemnon, after tossing and turning with grief and worry, comes up with a plan (βουλή), a sequence that, as we have seen, parallels the opening of Book 2. He decides that he will go to Nestor and ask <em>him</em> to come up with a plan (there called μῆτιν). <em>Boulē</em> is used therefore in several places in <em>Iliad</em> 2, 9, and 10 to denote a plan of action. As it happens, all three plans are conceived and carried out during the night, and it seems that in these contexts <em>boulē</em> is closely associated with <em>mētis</em>. (See also 10.302, where Hektor likewise conceives of a πυκινὴν … βουλήν in a line that matches <em>Iliad</em> 2.55 in our texts. According to the testimony that has survived about the <em>Cypria</em> [testimonium 1 Bernabé], that epic opened with Zeus in distress about the overpopulation of the earth. It is unfortunately not clear from the context whether Zeus is attempting to sleep or if these thoughts are in fact occurring during the day, but the thoughts that lead to the plan he formulates, called βουλή in line 7 of the surviving fragment, are termed πυκιναῖς πραπίδεσσιν [3].) Here in Book 10 Agamemnon says that their plan must be wily (κερδαλέης); in Book 9 the adjective used is <em>pukinos</em> (as at 10.302; see also on 10.5–9 above). In <em>Odyssey</em> 13, Athena calls Odysseus “by far the best of all mortals in planning” (βροτῶν ὄχ’ ἄριστος ἁπάντων βουλῇ, 13.297–298) and “crafty in intricate ways” (ποικιλομῆτα, 13.293). In <em>Odyssey</em> 22.230, Athena tells Odysseus that the city of Troy was taken by his <em>boulē</em> (σῇ δ’ ἥλω βουλῇ Πριάμου πόλις εὐρυάγυια)—another ambush that according to epic tradition occurred at night. This is how Menelaos describes Odysseus in the wooden horse when he tells Telemakhos the story in <em>Odyssey</em> 4:</p><p>ἤδη μὲν πολέων ἐδάην βουλήν τε νόον τε</p><p>ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, πολλὴν δ’ ἐπελήλυθα γαῖαν·</p><p>ἀλλ’ οὔ πω τοιοῦτον ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν</p><p>οἷον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἔσκε φίλον κῆρ.</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 4.267–270</p><p>I have become familiar with the planning and thinking</p><p>of men who are heroes, and I have traveled over much of the earth.</p><p>But I have not yet known with my eyes a man equivalent</p><p>to my friend Odysseus’ enduring mind.</p><p>The <em>boulē</em> of the wooden horse is arguably Odysseus’ signature <em>mētis</em>, on which see Haft 1990.</p>

Hektor’s deeds on the battlefield are unprecedented in Agamemnon’s experience, and are of course the reason why he is sleepless this night. The language even juxtaposes the “one” and “so many”: <em>mermera erg</em>a are accomplished by one man (or two men, as we shall see) who kill many more. In the next day’s battle, too, Hektor is reported to be accomplishing <em>mermera erga</em> and destroying phalanxes of young men (<em>Iliad</em> 11.502–503).

<p>οὐ γάρ πω ἰδόμην, οὐδ᾽ ἔκλυον  </p><p>Note the augment on ἔκλυον. Egbert Bakker (2005) has argued that in Homeric diction the verbal augment has a primarily deictic function, and signifies proximity or immediacy rather than emphasizing a past tense. For this reason we find it used more often in similes and in speeches than in narrative contexts. In speeches, augmented aorists are almost always best translated as perfects (Bakker 2005:116, with further bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>). Bakker points out that the use of negating particles like οὔ πω with aorist verbs similarly “effaces the distinctness of any past, making it come into the speaker’s present” (Bakker 2005:170). Indeed, our first instance of an augmented aorist in Book 10 is paired with an unaugmented aorist that is preceded by οὔ πω. </p>

# Iliad 10.51-52

<p>These lines were athetized by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus, two great directors of the library in Ptolemaic Alexandria in the second century BCE. Aristarchus was considered the premier editor of Homer in antiquity, and the scholia that survive in our medieval manuscripts of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> are full of references to him. As Gregory Nagy has demonstrated (see especially Nagy 2004), Aristarchus had available to him at the library of Ptolemaic Alexandria a great number of Homeric texts. Aristarchus’ practice was to collate the many texts known to him and to comment on the various readings that he found, often asserting which reading he felt to be the correct one. Unlike a modern editor, however, Aristarchus confined his opinions to his commentary, which was published in its own separate volume. The notes in the commentary were linked to the appropriate passages in the text by means of a system of critical signs. These signs are preserved in the Venetus A manuscript of Homer, and to a lesser extent elsewhere (see Bird 2009). So here, although both Aristarchus and his predecessor Aristophanes did not feel verses 51–52 were composed by Homer, they left them in the text, and indicated their judgment with the sign for athetesis (see Figure 4). The scholia in the margins of the Venetus A tell us that Aristarchus condemned 10.51 because it repeats the content of 10.49, and because δηθά and δολιχόν mean the same thing. There is a tendency among the Alexandrian editors to disapprove of verses that they feel to be repetitive, preferring compression over expansion. This preference for compression is rooted in the poetics of their day (see Dué 2001a), and does not offer us good grounds for condemning the lines. But it is noteworthy that these scholars did not impose their preferences on the text itself, with the result that much more Homeric poetry survives for us today than probably would have otherwise.</p>

<p>Αἴαντα</p><p>The Ajax being referred to here is the son of Telamon. (See below on 10.110–113.) Evidence from the Venetus A scholia indicates that Aristarchus may have known a reading Αἴαντε instead of Αἴαντα:</p><p>ὁ μὲν Δίδυμος τὴν Ἀριστάρχειον γραφὴν λέγει “Αἴαντε” δυϊκῶς, ὁ δὲ Τήλεφος λέγει κακῶς εἰρηκέναι τὸν Δίδυμον· οὐ γὰρ ἐπ’ ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς Αἴαντας ὁ Μενέλαος πέμπεται.</p><p>Didymus says that the Aristarchean reading is “Αἴαντε” in the dual, but Telephos says that Didymus has misspoken, since Menelaos is not sent to both Ajaxes.</p><p>This disagreement in the scholia about Aristarchus’ reading may reflect an evolution in the meaning of the dual form Αἴαντε that has been noted by previous scholars. In some early stage of the Greek epic tradition, the dual Αἴαντε referred not to Ajax the son of Telamon and Ajax the son of Oileus as a pair, but rather to Telamonion Ajax and his brother Teucer (whose special fighting style is discussed above at p.60; see Ebbott 2003:41–43 with references <em>ad loc.</em>) The dual form of the name that Aristarchus knew here would be perfectly appropriate in a time when it was understood to refer to Ajax and Teucer. In any case, at 10.228 the two Ajaxes (Αἴαντε δύω) volunteer to go on the spying mission with Diomedes, but it is not clear whether at that point both Ajaxes are volunteering, or whether it is the fighting pair of Ajax and Teucer. It is possible that the dual would have been understood differently by audiences of different periods.  </p>

# Iliad 10.53

<p>Ἰδομενῆα κάλεσσον</p><p>It is significant that Idomeneus figures prominently here among the chief heroes, since he is the speaker of the most explicit description of ambush warfare in Homeric epic. He and Meriones discuss what it takes to succeed in ambush at <em>Iliad</em> 13.266–294 (discussed above, pp. 45–47). Idomeneus and Meriones are from Crete, and Odysseus links himself to both Idomeneus and Crete throughout his “Cretan lies” in the second half of the <em>Odyssey, </em>including a tale involving the ambush of the son of Idomeneus<em> (Odyssey</em> 13.259–275). The alternative warfare of ambush, with its reliance on cunning and dissimulation rather than force, may have been traditionally a Cretan specialty or in some way associated with Cretans. Certainly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, mention of Crete functions as a narrative signal for the external audience, and possibly for the internal audience as well, since Odysseus seems to use these stories as a kind of coded message or <em>ainos</em> (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.508), by which he gauges the recipient’s loyalty and character. Crete serves as a cloak for Odysseus’ true identity as he carefully and cleverly sets up his return, just as, in war, heroes camouflage themselves for a nighttime spying expedition or ambush. (For more on the concept of the cloak and its connection to Odysseus’ <em>ainos</em> in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, see below at 10.149.)  </p>

There, we hear that the guard consists of seven leaders, each of whom is named, and each leader has a hundred young men with long spears. As we will see later (10.196–197), Meriones and Thrasymedes, named as two of the seven in <em>Iliad</em> 9 but given special mention here at 10.57–59, will join the leaders to deliberate about the plan, and, importantly, give Diomedes and Odysseus some of their armor. Back in <em>Iliad</em> 9.87, we are told that the guard takes up their post between the ditch and the wall (see further on 10.194). For more on the anxieties about the watch falling asleep, see on 10.98.

The concept of the <em>opaōn</em> is similar to that of the <em>therapōn</em> (defined by Gregory Nagy as ‘ritual substitute’), which is what Achilles calls Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 16.244. In that passage, Achilles prays that when Patroklos returns to battle he have the power to fight on his own, instead of as part of the closely linked fighting pair that Achilles and Patroklos normally form. Instead, however, Patroklos dies (at the hands of Apollo, Euphorbus, and Hektor), wearing Achilles’ armor and in many ways previewing Achilles’ own death, in some traditions at least, at the hands of Paris and Apollo. (On <em>opaōn</em> and its application to Meriones, we are indebted to an unpublished paper by Ellen Aitken. On the <em>therapōn</em> as a ‘ritual substitute’ for the hero, as Patroklos functions for Achilles, see Nagy 1979:33 and 292–293. On the relationship between Achilles’ and Patroklos’ death, see also Burgess 1997.) The night watch seems to be led by younger men in particular, like Meriones here: is there a suggestion that they can better endure the sleeplessness? See further on 10.259 for the association between young men like Meriones and ambush.  </p>

# Iliad 10.65

<p>ἀβροτάξομεν</p><p>There are two different spellings of this verb (found only here in our Homeric texts) in the textual tradition: ἀβροτάξομεν and ἀμβροτάξομεν. Sources are nearly evenly divided between them. West (1997: 229) points out that the form ἀμβροτάξομεν “offers the unmetrical sequence ‒ ⏑  ‒, but the difficulty is resolved by going back to an ancient <em>*hamṛtáxomen</em>.” We might speculate, then, that the spelling without the <em>mu</em> came about because it seemed to solve the metrical difficulty by relying on a plosive + liquid exception to the rule that multiple consonants form a closed syllable (see West 1997: 220–221). In any case, ἀμβροτάξομεν belongs to the categories of older words West identifies that became unmetrical as their form evolved. They were preserved as part of the formulaic language even as these sound-changes occurred in the Greek language as a whole. The antiquity of this word could mean that concern about missing one another in the dark of night is a traditional idea, part of the poetics of night raids or nighttime spying missions.  </p>

# Iliad 10.75

<p>εὐνῇ ἔνι μαλακῇ· παρὰ δ᾽ ἔντεα ποικίλ᾽ ἔκειτο</p><p>Nestor and Diomedes are described in the state in which they are found sleeping by the others, with the result that each is characterized as a warrior of a particular style. Nestor is an old man and sleeps on a soft bed, but his weapons are right beside him, which implies that he is ready for battle at a moment’s notice (see also 10.78–79). The battle gear that lies next to him is not the same as that he puts on to go out in 10.131ff. The shining helmet (10.76) would be inappropriate for a night mission (see below on 10.257). Rather, the armor serves to characterize Nestor as a warrior in his own right and give him distinction. Agamemnon here, as elsewhere in the <em>Iliad,</em> looks to Nestor first and foremost for strategy. At <em>Iliad</em> 7.325 and 9.84 he is Νέστωρ, οὗ καὶ πρόσθεν ἀρίστη φαίνετο βουλή (“Nestor, whose planning also before was manifestly the best”). Nestor orchestrates most of the events of Book 9, as he does here in Book 10. In Book 11, it is Nestor who sets in motion Patroklos’ fatal impersonation of Achilles. On Nestor’s role in the <em>Iliad</em> and in the larger epic tradition, see Frame 2009.  </p>

<p>ἠέ τιν᾽ οὐρήων διζήμενος, ἤ τιν᾽ ἑταίρων</p><p>The idea that someone would be out at night looking for a mule (τιν᾽ οὐρήων) seemed odd to Alexandrian scholars, as it might to us. The A scholia indicates that Aristarchus athetized the line because of that word, suggesting that it should be some form of κοῦρος, to indicate the young men of the guard. Instead of assuming a mistake by the poet (as the scholiast does) or by a scribe, another approach would be to see if there are any traditional associations with mules getting loose at night. There are no examples in surviving Homeric poetry, but there may well have been in the larger tradition. In any case, mules are used in a variety of contexts in the <em>Iliad</em>, by both the Trojans and the Achaeans. (See <em>Iliad</em> 1.50, 23.111 and 115, 24.716 for οὐρεύς; the word ἡμίονος is also used in this book at 10.352 and throughout the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>.)   </p>

<p>χρεώ </p><p>As each hero is roused from sleep the theme of the great need the Achaeans find themselves on this night is emphasized. We saw in 10.43 that Agamemnon speaks to Menelaos of their need for a “plan,” <em>boulē</em>, just as Nestor does in the opening of <em>Iliad</em> 9. Here, Nestor naturally asks what need has caused him to be woken in the middle of the night. In 10.118, he advises Agamemnon to wake up the Greek leaders, citing the “unbearable need” (χρειὼ … ἀνεκτός) that has come upon them. Likewise in 10.142 Odysseus asks what need so great (χρειὼ τόσον) has driven Agamemnon and Nestor to wake him. Nestor asks him not to reproach them, since the situation really is that dire: “Such sorrow has come upon the Achaeans” (τοῖον γὰρ ἄχος βεβίηκεν Ἀχαιούς, 10.145). In 10.172, we find χρεώ invoked by Nestor once again, in much the same language as at 10.142: “An especially great need has come upon the Achaeans” (μάλα μεγάλη χρειὼ βεβίηκεν Ἀχαιούς). This theme runs throughout Books 9–11, as Robert Rabel (1991) has demonstrated. Rabel argues that each of these three books has a similar tripartite structure consisting of recognition of need, journey, and return and report.  </p>

# Iliad 10.98

<p>καμάτω ἁδηκότες  </p><p>The meaning of ἁδηκότες can be easily gleaned from context, but its derivation is disputed. This formula appears four times in this book (here, 10.312, 10.399, and 10.471), but with the exception of Odyssey 12.281 nowhere else in the <em>Iliad</em> or <em>Odyssey</em>. (See also <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 460.) Here is another instance of a formula closely tied to the night that has been seen by previous commentators and scholars as evidence of the book’s unusual style. We have argued that <em>Iliad</em> 10 is essentially our only surviving extended narration of a night raid, and this accident of transmission makes these formulas seem more unusual than would otherwise be the case. If we examine the use of καμάτῳ ἁδηκότες in this book more closely, we can see why this formula would have been particularly useful for a poet composing a night raid, and for one composing this episode in particular.</p><p>We have already observed that the necessity of staying awake is part of the hardship that characterizes ambush warfare. This necessity, as it happens, is likewise an important component of keeping a night watch. Because on this night the Trojans are encamped nearby—which we have seen is a cause of great anxiety for the Achaeans—the importance of the night watch is heightened. It is vital that the Achaean watches not fail in their duty; they must not fall asleep.</p><p>In 10.312, Hektor proposes that someone find out if the Achaeans are keeping a proper night watch, or if in fact they are too worn out by the toil of battle to do so (καμάτῳ ἁδηκότες αἰνῷ). In 10.399, Dolon repeats Hektor’s words to Odysseus virtually word for word, as so often happens in Homer when messages and information are relayed. In 10.420–422, Dolon reveals that the allies of the Trojans are not keeping night watches, and are instead leaving security to the Trojans, who have wives and children to protect. And so, in 10.471, we find that Rhesos and his men have done what the Achaeans must not do: they have fallen asleep, overcome by exhaustion (οἱ δ’ εὗδον καμάτῳ ἁδηκότες). In <em>Odyssey</em> 12.281, Odysseus attempts to force his men to sail through the night, past the island of the sun god (where Teiresias had foretold disaster). The men refuse, saying that they are too worn out to do so (καμάτῳ ἀδηκότας ἠδὲ καὶ ὕπνῳ). It seems clear that this formula occurs naturally when the hardship of staying awake is added to the weariness of a day’s toil, whether it be a day spent fighting in the <em>polemos</em>, or, in the case of the <em>Odyssey</em>, a day spent rowing at sea. (Cf. the simile at <em>Iliad</em> 7.4–7, which compares the relief that the Trojan soldiers feel when Hektor and Paris return to the battlefield to that experienced by sailors who, when their limbs are giving out from the toil of rowing [καμάτῳ δ’ ὑπὸ γυῖα λέλυνται], hope for and receive a favorable wind.) It is not necessary to see these instances in Book 10 as idiosyncratic in their concentration, the work of a particular poet with his own personal and/or Odyssean style, as Danek and Hainsworth have most recently explained them. (See Danek 1988:84–86 </p><p>and Hainsworth 1993 <em>ad loc.</em>) Rather, they are yet another example of the way that formulas and traditional themes go hand in hand.</p>

# Iliad 10.104-107

<p>Leaf suggests that these lines “are at least somewhat out of place” because Achilles has just refused to return. This statement follows his argument that it is obvious that <em>Iliad</em> 10 “forms no essential part of the story of the <em>Iliad</em>” (Leaf 1900:423). Hainsworth (1993, <em>ad loc.</em>) similarly remarks, “The open condition, implying the possibility of Akhilleus reentering the fray, is unexpected when such a change of heart has just been ruled out of court. A remote condition … would certainly be more appropriate.” Petegorsky states, “Nestor’s reference to Achilles is curious; for it has the effect of conceding to Achilles the role of the hero who will put a stop to Hector, at the very moment when we would expect him to be suggesting an alternative” (1982:203). But, Petegorsky argues, Achilles’ refusal has in effect made the situation revert to what it was before the Embassy, and this deference to Achilles as the only way to stop Hektor in fact shows how much the Doloneia takes part in the Iliadic tradition, both thematically and in its narrative momentum towards Achilles’ eventual return (1982:177–185). The alternative strategy adopted in <em>Iliad</em> 10, one focused on <em>mētis</em>, spying, and ambush, will not change the <em>Iliad</em>’s traditional course of events, but will highlight through contrast the need for Achilles’ strength to save the Achaeans.</p>

Frame connects that event in particular with Menelaos’ <em>nostos</em>, in which he displays hesitancy, lack of incitement, and a lack of <em>noos</em>. These same qualities will make him a poor choice for the spying mission: Agamemnon seems to know this, as we see in his fear that Diomedes will choose Menelaos based on status alone (see 10.237–240). As we have noted elsewhere (see 10.31), Menelaos is portrayed as a successful ambusher in the <em>Odyssey</em>, but that portrayal seems quite separate from his relationship with his brother, whom, as we have seen earlier on this night, he looks to for direction, even as he is the first to voice the idea of the spying mission.   </p>

One of Odysseus’ most common epithets in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, πολύμητις (as at 10.148), likewise highlights this central aspect of Odysseus’ character. Odysseus is the hero who takes down the Cyclops by a carefully orchestrated ambush, and the attack on the suitors is structured like an ambush in many ways.

# Iliad 10.41

<p>We find night likewise described in <em>Iliad</em> 10.142. Ambrosia, the food of both the gods (see <em>Odyssey</em> 5.93, 5.199, 9.359) and their divine horses, is used by the gods for a variety of other purposes in Homer, including as perfume (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.445), as a cosmetic (<em>Iliad</em> 14.170), and as a preservative for the corpses of Patroklos and Sarpedon (<em>Iliad</em> 16.670 and 680 and 19.38). At <em>Iliad</em> 1.529, Zeus’ hair is described as <em>ambrosios</em>, as is sleep at 2.19. In <em>Iliad</em> 18.268 and 24.363, night is again ambrosial. There is, as we can see, a wide range of associations for this word.

In <em>Iliad </em>10.83, 10.276, and 10.386, the metrically equivalent phrase νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is used in the same position in the line. This phrase has a spondee where ἀμβροσίην has a dactyl, but both phrases occupy the same metrical space. νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is also found at <em>Odyssey</em> 9.143 and <em>the Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 578. Although it is not impossible to have two metrically equivalent formulas expressing the same essential idea, such duplications are rare in Homer, so we should expect the two adjectives to convey different things. The context of νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην in <em>Odyssey</em> 9 is the ambush-like episode of the Cyclops (see Dué and Ebbott 2010), and its use of Hermes (whose nighttime thievery and cunning are celebrated in the Homeric Hymn) is likewise suggestive of an association between this word and nighttime escapades. Norman Austin (1975:71–73) sees ὀρφναίη as being particularly evocative of night’s darkness, which is of course appropriate for both ambush and thievery. Night is in general ambrosial, according to Austin, because of the welcome rest it brings at the end of the day, but it is particularly so in the <em>Iliad</em>: “Night [in the <em>Iliad</em>] means the end of a day’s fighting. It is relief from weary battle, but, more importantly for the Homeric hero, it means survival through another day.” But the night of <em>Iliad</em> 10 is marked by anxiety, fear, and a raid on the enemy camp, hence the appropriateness of νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην. (For alternate views on why night is ambrosial, see Hainsworth 1993 <em>ad</em> 10.41 and Heubeck, West, and Hainsworth 1988 <em>ad</em> 4.429, 4.445, and 5.93 with bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>)

Georg Danek (1988:80) has interpreted the alternation between the formulas νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην and νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην as an intentional variation on the part of the composer of this book. (For more on Danek’s arguments about the composer of <em>Iliad</em> 10, see Dué and Ebbott 2010. Danek views the attempt to vary traditional phraseology as a hallmark of this poet’s individual style. As we note in the above referenced essay, this approach is problematic from the standpoint of the methodology developed by Parry and Lord in studying oral traditions. It rests on the assumption that a singer within a traditional system would strive to “break free” of that tradition and compose in a new way. Austin’s approach is helpful, because it finds two different ways that night can be characterized and shows how context affects the choice of either formula. Throughout his 1975 work, however, Austin himself seeks to counter Parry’s demonstration of the economy of Homeric diction, and uses these words as an example of how the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> can achieve various literary goals, unconstrained by formulaic diction. But another way to look at it is to say that Austin’s account of the different conceptualizations of the night enhances and clarifies Parry’s arguments about the economy of Homeric diction, which Parry describes as “free of phrases which, having the same metrical value and expressing the same idea, could replace one another” (Parry 1971:86). There is more than one way to say “night” here, because night is not a monolithic concept. When a poet wants to invoke night with its associations with relief and rest, νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην would be easily summoned. The night encompassed by <em>Iliad</em> 10, however, is of a different sort, and as a result, the formula νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην is used three or four times. This interpretation seems strengthened by <em>Iliad</em> 24.363, which is identical to 10.83, with the exception of the formula for night:

τίς δ᾽ οὗτος κατὰ νῆας ἀνα στρατὸν ἔρχεαι οἶος

νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην, ὅτε θ᾽ εὕδουσι βροτοὶ ἄλλοι,
<p class="chssourceattrib" style="text-align: right;"><em><span class="chscitetitle">Iliad</span></em> 10.82–83</p>
“Who is this that comes down to the ships through the encamped mass of warriors all alone

through the dark night, when other mortals are sleeping?”

&nbsp;

πῇ πάτερ ὧδ’ ἵππους τε καὶ ἡμιόνους ἰθύνεις

νύκτα δι’ ἀμβροσίην, ὅτε θ’ εὕδουσι βροτοὶ ἄλλοι;
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Iliad</em> 24.362–363</p>
“Where, father, are you driving your horses and mules like this

through the ambrosial night, when the other mortals are sleeping?”

In <em>Iliad</em> 24, Priam is attempting to sneak into Achilles’ camp during the night undetected; the formula νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην would seem to be appropriate. (See above on 10.1ff. for more on how Priam’s journey has thematic associations with other nighttime missions to the enemy’s camp.) But the speaker of these lines is the disguised Hermes, talking to Priam in the form of a young man who should be unaware of Priam’s mission. Accordingly, he uses the more innocent-sounding and divine νύκτα δι’ ἀμβροσίην. Alternatively, we can interpret the absence of ὀρφναίην as significant within the system that generated the two formulas. As we have seen, the theme of the night raid/ambush attracts its own subset of formulas, which are not typically found outside of this context in Homer. If Priam’s expedition to Achilles, though it takes place at night, is not being characterized as an ambush, night is therefore not dark, but the more generic “ambrosial.” (For a more expanded discussion of how this formula works within the theme of ambush, see, in addition to Dué and Ebbott 2010, Dué 2011.

# Iliad 10.144

<p>διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη πολυμήχαν’ Ὀδυσσεῦ</p><p>Nestor, who is the most diplomatic of the heroes in the <em>Iliad</em>, addresses Odysseus in connection with both his lineage and with two of his traditional epithets, thereby using an entire hexameter to address him. He does the same with Agamemnon in 10.103 (Ἀτρεΐδη κύδιστε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν Ἀγάμεμνον), in precisely the way that Agamemnon instructs Menelaos to wake up the heroes in 10.68–69. And as with Agamemnon, Nestor chooses what is perhaps the most honorific of Odysseus’ traditional epithets. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the epithet διογενὲς ‘descended from Zeus’ is applied to several heroes, including Patroklos (1.337), Achilles (1.489), Ajax (4.489), and Menelaos (23.294), but in the <em>Odyssey</em> it is restricted to Odysseus. πολυμήχανος, on the other hand, is Odysseus’ distinctive epithet. It is used of him and him alone, and, with one exception, always in the vocative. That one exception is the signature description of Odysseus by Athena, who in the guise of Mentes tells Telemakhos that his father is on his way home, “since he is a man of many devices (πολυμήχανος, Odyssey 1.205).”</p><p>It is a testament to the economy of Homeric diction that other than the full verse phrase that appears here (and six other places in the <em>Iliad</em>, as well as fifteen times in the <em>Odyssey</em>) there are only three ways to address Odysseus in the vocative in our <em>Iliad</em>, each with a different metrical configuration: ὦ πολύαιν’ Ὀδυσεῦ μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν (9.673, 10.544), ὦ Ὀδυσεῦ πολύαινε (11.430), and [ὦ] Ὀδυσεῦ (9.346, 14.104). This does not mean, however, that the epithets are without semantic weight (see especially the formulation of Lord 1960/2000:66, quoted on 10.3 above). The full verse formula is particularly flexible and can be used or not at a composer’s discretion. Its contexts suggest that it conveys formality and respect. In the <em>Iliad,</em> the goddess Athena and the heroes Agamemnon, Diomedes, Achilles, and Ajax address Odysseus this way. In the <em>Odyssey,</em> Athena, Calypso, and Circe do, as do the shades of Teiresias, Agamemnon, and Achilles.</p><p>Diomedes, by contrast, does not get quite the same respect as Agamemnon and Odysseus. In 10.159, Diomedes is addressed as simply “the son of Tydeus.” In <em>Iliad</em> 9.32–49, Diomedes is the first to speak after Agamemnon’s address to the assembled warriors and is sharply critical of him. Nestor praises Diomedes for his abilities as a warrior and for his speaking ability but qualifies the latter: he is the best in counsel for his age group (<em>Iliad</em> 9.54). It seems that Diomedes is still too junior in relation to Nestor to get the full honorific address. Three times, however, he is addressed by others with the affectionate full-line formula Τυδεΐδη Διόμηδες ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ (<em>Iliad</em> 5.242, by Sthenelos; Iliad 5.826, by Athena; <em>Iliad</em> 10.234, by Agamemnon).  </p>

# Iliad 10.145

<p>τοῖον γὰρ ἄχος βεβίηκεν Ἀχαιούς</p><p>See also above on 10.85. The sorrow (<em>akhos</em>) that Nestor cites here is of course ultimately the result of the withdrawal of Achilles and its disastrous consequences, and Nestor uses an equivalent phrase when the strife between Agamemnon and Achilles begins (see <em>Iliad</em> 1.254; see Nagy 1979:69–72, 94–95 for the equivalence of ἄχος and πένθος in Homeric diction). The Trojans have had a great deal of success in Achilles’ absence and are now encamped on the plain. This sorrow is what keeps Agamemnon and Menelaos awake at the opening of this book. Likewise, in <em>Iliad</em> 9.9, Agamemnon is “struck in his heart by great sorrow” (ἄχεϊ μεγάλῳ βεβολημένος ἦτορ). Achilles had predicted that Agamemnon would feel sorrow (ἀχνύμένος, <em>Iliad</em> 1.241) when the Greeks fell dying. The <em>akhos</em> that Achilles experiences when Agamemnon threatens to take and then in fact takes Briseis in <em>Iliad</em> 1 initiates his wrath, which in turn leads to the sorrow of the Achaeans. Nagy has argued that there is a “pervasive nexus between ἄχος and Ἀχιλ(λ)εύς” in Homeric diction that is “integrated in the inherited formulaic system and hence deeply rooted in the epic tradition” (Nagy 1979:79). This <em>akhos</em> seems to be the root of Achilles’ name, which Nagy etymologizes as <em>*Akhí-lāṷos</em> ‘whose host of men is sorrowful [= grieving]’. (See Nagy 1979:69–93 and Nagy 2004:131–137, as well as Palmer 1963:78–79 and Holland 1993.)   </p>

# Iliad 10.148

<p>πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεὺς</p><p>On Odysseus’ associations with <em>mētis</em>, see on 10.5–9 and on 10.137 above. <em>Polumētis</em> ‘who is crafty in many ways’ is one of Odysseus’ most commonly used epithets. Other than Odysseus it is only used of Hephaistos (πολυμήτιος, <em>Iliad</em> 21.355), who is the god of a different sort of craft. (The English word ‘craft’, like the Greek <em>mētis</em>, encompasses both meanings.) Milman Parry says of this particular epithet: “δῖος and πολύμητις, for the audience, describe the Odysseus of all the epic poems which sang his deeds” (MHV 171). πολύμητις is one of the distinctive epithets of Odysseus, while δῖος is a generic epithet of heroes (see Parry MHV 145 for πολύμητις as a distinctive epithet, and MHV 84 for δῖος as generic). Parry writes:</p><p>Epic lines without epithets would have seemed to them like a heroic character without his traditional attributes. But even now, who among those of us who have any knowledge of the legend has asked why Odysseus should be crafty in this or that particular episode? Just so, Homer’s listeners demanded epithets and paid them no attention, showing thereby the same lack of exact observation that becomes a habit with the modern reader. And it is this lack of exact observation that explains uses of the epithet which appear to us unmotivated, because we look for their motivations in the lines where they occur, rather than in all the poetry Homer’s audience had already heard before they ever heard him sing.</p><p>Parry MHV 137–138</p><p>As we discussed on 10.3 in connection with the phrase ποιμένα λαῶν, the phrase πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεὺς can be used of Odysseus even in situations in which he is not being particularly crafty; the distinctive noun-epithet combination is, to quote the formulation of Nagy once again, “like a small theme song that conjures up a thought-association with the traditional essence of an epic figure” (Nagy 1990b:23). The phrase is not without significance in an ambush context, however, because Odysseus is a pre-eminent ambusher within the tradition as a whole. Odysseus is called πολύμητις just as he leaves his tent, which marks the beginning of what will become a spying mission/ambush episode that will prominently feature Odysseus’ <em>mētis</em>. Once that episode is well underway, Odysseus will be again called πολύμητις when he interrogates Dolon (10.382; see also 10.488, where he handles the horses so they are not spooked).  </p>

# Iliad 10.149

<p>ποικίλον ἀμφ᾽ ὤμοισι σάκος θέτο</p><p>Agamemnon and Diomedes each wear a lion skin, Menelaos wears a leopard skin, Nestor wears a <em>khiton</em> and <em>khlaina</em>, and all take a weapon (<em>egkhos</em> or <em>doru</em>), but Odysseus takes only a shield and leaves without putting on any outerwear of any kind. This seemingly mundane detail actually serves two significant narrative functions. First and foremost, it sets up the extended arming scene that takes place at the assembly, just before the raid itself (see below on 10.254–272). Odysseus’ lack of appropriate gear here means that he will have to borrow armor at the assembly. Second, Odysseus’ lack of an animal skin has an intriguing corollary the Odyssey, where, in one of his Cretan lies to Eumaios in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, Odysseus comes close to revealing his true identity, at least from the perspective of a traditional audience of epic. Odysseus describes how once on a cold night at Troy he went out on an ambush. All the other heroes were dressed for the weather, but he himself had no cloak, and had to come up with a clever scheme to get one from one of his companions on the lokhos. Odysseus’ Cretan lie may well be playfully alluding to a Doloneia tradition, in which case the story is a coded verbal message (<em>ainos</em>) directed at both the internal audience (Eumaios) and the external audience, who will “get” the inside reference. Such a reference is possible if we understand the <em>Iliad</em> (including the Doloneia) and Odyssey to be co-existing oral traditions, evolving in conjunction with one another. (On the <em>ainos</em> as a coded verbal message in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, see both Muellner 1976:97 and Nagy 1979:234–237, with further reference <em>ad loc.</em>) On the multiple significances of the shield being “intricately patterned” (<em>poikilos</em>), see above on 10.30.   </p>

The shining of the bronze like lightning is a frequent image in Homeric poetry (see <em>Iliad</em> 11.66, which is also an explicit simile, and the metaphorical uses of στεροπή with bronze at <em>Iliad</em> 11.83 and 19.363, and <em>Odyssey</em> 4.72 and 14.268 = 17.437). In most of those cases, just as here, the gleam of the bronze has a threatening or awe-inspiring quality to it. That the bronze shines this way at night is suggestive in terms of what is visible in the dark.  </p>

# Iliad 10.159

<p>ὄρσεο  </p><p>The manuscripts are divided between this reading and ἔγρεο. The scholia indicate that Aristarchus had both readings: ὄρσεο· διχῶς ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος, ἔγρεο καὶ ὄρσεο [A intermarginal scholia]; ἔγρεο· γράφεται καὶ ὄρσεο. διχῶς αἱ Ἀριστάρχου [T interlinear scholia]. This is possible because two separate editions or <em>ekdoseis</em> of the text of Homer were attributed to Aristarchus <em>(= </em>αἱ Ἀριστάρχου in the scholia), both of which were known to his student Didymus. From Didymus’ scholarly work many of the scholia derive. (On the <em>ekdoseis</em> of Aristarchus, see Montanari 1998 and Nagy 2004:85–86. On the sources for the Homeric scholia, see Nagy 2004:3–24 and Blackwell and Dué 2009.)</p><p>The sources, both ancient and medieval, are perhaps divided here because both verbs are well attested in the formulaic diction. ἔγρεο occurs here and in two places in the <em>Odyssey</em>; ὄρσεο is attested four times in the <em>Iliad</em> and once in the <em>Odyssey</em>. Clearly, both verbs could be generated by a poet composing in performance. Here is a perfect illustration of the difficulty a modern editor of Homer faces when trying to choose between two or more equally Homeric (= formulaic) variations. We, as the editors of this volume, have for this very reason rejected a traditional text critical approach, and instead have advocated a multitextual approach that accounts for the multiformity of the Homeric poems at different historical points in their transmission. (See above, “<em>Iliad</em> 10: A Multitextual Approach.”)</p>

<p>The third-century CE scholar and poet Diogenes Laertius relates an anecdote (6.53) that features the hexameter line μή τίς τοι εὔδοντι μεταφρένῳ ἐν δόρυ πήξῃ. This verse is probably a literary play on <em>Iliad</em> 8.95: μή τίς τοι φεύγοντι μεταφρένῳ ἐν δόρυ πήξῃ. The twelfth-century scholar Eustathius may be in fact thinking of Diogenes and not Homer when he writes (in 519.32) ὁ Νέστωρ τῷ Διομήδῃ κειμένῳ πού φησιν· ἔγρεο, μή τις τοι καθεύδοντι μεταφρένῳ ἐν δόρυ πήξῃ (“Somewhere Nestor says to the sleeping Diomedes, ‘Wake up, lest someone pierce you in the back with a spear while you sleep’”; cf.

<p>δυσωρήσωνται is another <em>hapax legomenon</em>, appearing only in <em>Iliad</em> 10, but we can understand why it might only appear once in our extant Homeric epics from the simile’s interaction with its context. Although in other parts of the poem there are similes describing predatory animals attacking domestic flocks at night, and the retaliation of men and dogs (see e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 11.546–557), here the simile is for a particularly “painful” night watch. It is painful both because the young men on guard duty have had an extremely hard day of fighting and because the Trojans are camped out for the first time, closer than ever, during this night.

# Iliad 10.194

<p>τάφροιο διέσσυτο</p><p>The act of crossing the ditch for the meeting conveys a spatial significance to the need the Achaeans feel and the plan they will construct to meet it. In <em>Iliad</em> 7, the Achaeans created a new boundary on the landscape by building their wall and ditch. The wall was built in the dark, before the dawn (<em>Iliad</em> 7.433). In the subsequent daytime battles, the boundary created by these two elements is of the utmost importance. M. L. West notes that “once they have been built they are frequently mentioned again, in every book from the eighth to the eighteenth, as well as in the twentieth and twenty-fourth” (1969:255). The boundary is mentioned either in order to indicate who is winning at that point or whenever the tide of battle turns. In the battle that takes place on the day before the night of <em>Iliad</em> 10, for example, Hektor pens in the Achaeans behind the wall so that the entire space is filled with men and horses (<em>Iliad</em> 8.213–216). The Achaeans rally after some inspiration from the gods and cross the ditch on the offensive (<em>Iliad</em> 8.253–265), but Hektor forces them back over the ditch as he once again takes the upper hand (<em>Iliad</em> 8.340–343). And, of course, the boundary will become even more significant the day after the night of <em>Iliad</em> 10, as the Trojans themselves cross it and threaten the ships with fire (the Trojans pass over the ditch and wall at the end of <em>Iliad</em> 12). Since the wall and ditch act as a threshold between the camp and the battlefield, one way of understanding the leaders crossing the ditch to hold their meeting is as a shift toward being on the offensive. Only the ditch is mentioned here: Petegorsky (1982:238n13) suggests that the “absence” of the wall presages its breach the next day. (For more on the poetic possibilities and traditional associations offered by the Achaean wall, see Boyd 1995.)  </p>

<p>ἐν καθαρῷ, ὅθι δὴ νεκύων διεφαίνετο χῶρος</p><p>Another significant feature of the landscape on this night is the number of corpses left on the battlefield. No truce has been allowed this time for the gathering of the dead (compare the truce agreed to at <em>Iliad</em> 7.407–411). The Trojan camp is also in a space specifically said to be free of corpses (this same line is also used at <em>Iliad</em> 8.491), and a picture of the landscape covered with corpses is repeatedly evoked (10.298, 10.343 = 10.387, 10.469). Such a detail is a reminder of the intense battle of the day before, which is the reason both for the embassy to Achilles and for this meeting, which will result in the spying mission and ambush. It is also a harbinger of the even greater battle that will happen on the next day, adding to the eerie atmosphere of the nighttime landscape.   </p>

<p>Fenik (1964:41) excoriates these lines, calling the idea that the Trojans might retreat into the city “wholly fatuous,” and he uses them to inquire “whether some special grounds, other than general incompetence, were responsible for the K poet’s extraordinary failure here.” But the assumption that a different, individual author composed these lines leads to the kind of evaluation that Fenik makes. Instead, using approaches based in oral poetics, we can see how these lines do not ignore the situation that the <em>Iliad</em> has presented, but rather resonate with what is to come. Diomedes and Odysseus will indeed capture (and kill, ἕλοι can mean both) someone at the edge of the enemy (ἐσχατόωντα): in fact, this can allude to both Dolon, from whom they will get information, and Rhesos, whose army is described as encamped at the edge: ἔσχατοι ἄλλων (10.434). Just so, the Trojans will not consider retreating on this night, though they will the next night (see <em>Iliad</em> 18.243–313). Petegorsky (1982:225–230) argues that Nestor’s proposal anticipates the later Trojan council scenes, during the next day’s fighting, particularly that in <em>Iliad</em> 18, in anticipation of Achilles’ return.</p>

# Iliad 10.211-212

<p>καὶ ἂψ εἰς ἡμέας ἔλθοι / ἀσκηθὴς  </p><p>When he proposes the spying mission, Nestor includes the crucial completion of the mission: namely, that the spy return to report what he has found out. The return of the spy ‘unscathed’ connects to the greater theme, and it shares concepts with the theme of the journey. One concern with any of these nighttime or secret operations, such as spying missions or ambushes, is that, if those who undertake them do not return, their comrades may never know what happened to them. Whether, how, and by whom a spy has been killed cannot be verified, and it is such knowledge that allows a warrior to be buried and honored after death. This lack of knowledge provides a strong contrast to daytime battle, in which one comrade will see another fall, and will subsequently go to protect his corpse or to attack his killer in retaliation. That sequence in battle is a pattern we see again and again in the <em>Iliad</em>. The same contrast between a death in open battle (bringing honor) and a death that occurs on a journey (resulting in an inability to bury and honor the person lost because of a lack of knowledge as well as the lack of the corpse) is expressed by loved ones of Odysseus in the <em>Odyssey</em>. The sentiment is first expressed by Telemakhos:</p><p>νῦν δ’ ἑτέρως ἐβόλοντο θεοὶ κακὰ μητιόωντες,</p><p>235  οἳ κεῖνον μὲν ἄϊστον ἐποίησαν περὶ πάντων</p><p>ἀνθρώπων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε θανόντι περ ὧδ’ ἀκαχοίμην,</p><p>εἰ μετὰ οἷσ’ ἑτάροισι δάμη Τρώων ἐνὶ δήμῳ,</p><p>ἠὲ φίλων ἐν χερσίν, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσε.</p><p>τῶ κέν οἱ τύμβον μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί,</p><p>240  ἠδέ κε καὶ ᾧ παιδὶ μέγα κλέος ἤρατ’ ὀπίσσω.</p><p>νῦν δέ μιν ἀκλειῶς Ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρέψαντο·</p><p>οἴχετ’ ἄϊστος ἄπυστος, ἐμοὶ δ’ ὀδύνας τε γόους τε</p><p>κάλλιπεν·</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 1.234–243</p><p>But now the gods have willed it otherwise, devising evils,</p><p>235  who have made that man [Odysseus] unseen beyond all</p><p>mortals, since I would not grieve this way at his death</p><p>if among his comrades he was subdued in the district of the Trojans</p><p>or in the hands of his friends, when he had finished war.</p><p>All the Achaeans would have made a burial mound for him,</p><p>240  and he would have won great fame [<em>kleos</em>] even for his child in the future.</p><p>But now the Arpuiai whirlwinds have snatched him up without fame [<em>kleos</em>].</p><p>He is gone, unseen, unheard of. And for me pain and laments</p><p>he left behind.</p><p>Later (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.365–372), Eumaios says something very similar in response to the disguised Odysseus’ story about the fate of Odysseus. He, too, contrasts the unknown circumstances of Odysseus’ presumed death at sea with a death in battle, after which a man’s comrades can bury him. A known death in battle brings <em>kleos</em>, which, having as its root meaning ‘something heard’ (see Nagy 1979:16, §2n3), is contrasted in Telemakhos’ words not only with an “unglorious” death (<em>Odyssey</em> 1.241) but also with Odysseus himself, who is “unseen” and “unheard of” (<em>Odyssey</em> 1.242). In <em>Iliad</em> 10, in the same line as ἀσκηθής (10.212), Nestor promises <em>kleos</em> to the man who undertakes this mission, but the return is necessary for that <em>kleos</em> to come about. For if a man were to go out on a nighttime spying mission, or an ambush, and not come back, he, too, would be unseen, unheard of, and could not be buried or honored properly.</p><p>So the need to complete the mission, the need for a return, is one way that a spying mission resembles a journey in epic diction. Coming back unscathed, ἀσκηθής, is used elsewhere in Homeric epic of a return home or of some other completion of a journey. It is used prominently in <em>Odyssey</em> 5 of the need to have both Telemakhos (<em>Odyssey</em> 5.26) and Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 5.144, 5.168) return to their fatherland (πατρίδα γαῖαν). At the very beginning of the story of his wanderings, Odysseus says that he would have returned home unscathed if the sea currents had not prevented him from making his way to Ithaka (<em>Odyssey</em> 9.79–81). Thus arriving unscathed seems especially associated with sailing journeys, as Odysseus also uses it in one of his Cretan lies, in this case for an easy sailing from Crete to Egypt (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.255; cf. Solon fr. 19 [West], who says that Kypris sent him home unscathed [<em>askēthēs</em>] in a fast ship for a good homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] to his own land). In one additional case in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus tells Achilles that Neoptolemos was very successful in battle and ambush (see pp. 47–48), and later adds that he was never hurt in the fighting—he was ἀσκηθής, never touched by a weapon. Although the context has referred to both battle and ambush, the word actually describes Neoptolemos as he boards his ship for the journey home, again displaying the connection between sailing journeys and <em>nostos</em>. The “Odyssean” language that many scholars have noted in Book 10, and have even cited as proof of its non-Iliadic nature, may be a thematic result, not only of the greater prominence of ambush in the <em>Odyssey</em>, but also of this thematic overlap between spying missions or ambushes and journeys, especially journeys home and those over the sea.</p><p>In the <em>Iliad</em>, ἀσκηθής is used in one other context, and that is, in fact, daytime battle. As Achilles prays to Zeus that Patroklos will be successful in saving the Achaeans and their ships from the Trojan onslaught, he asks as well that Patroklos then return unscathed to him at the swift ships: ἀσκηθής μοι ἔπειτα θοὰς ἐπὶ νῆας ἵκοιτο (<em>Iliad</em> 16.247). Patroklos is not going on an ambush here, and there is no concern that what happens to him will be unknown. Instead, the fact that he is going as Achilles’ substitute must also be a special kind of departure for battle, and the desire for the substitute to come back unscathed evokes this same word (see Nagy 1979:292–295 for Patroklos as a ritual substitute for Achilles in this battle). Zeus’ reaction is to grant the first part of Achilles’ prayer, but not the safe return: σόον δ’ ἀνένευσε μάχης ἐξαπονέεσθαι (<em>Iliad</em> 16.252). Petegorsky (1982:220–221) argues that these two uses of ἀσκηθής in the Iliad highlight the isolation of Patroklos going into battle without Achilles, in contrast to the pairing of Diomedes and Odysseus.</p>

# Iliad 10.212-213

<p>κλέος ‘glory in song’ and δόσις ‘gift’ are not incompatible rewards in Homeric epic. Throughout the <em>Iliad</em> material prizes are a physical manifestation of a warrior’s place in the song tradition and are a major sources of contention among heroes. In <em>Iliad</em> 1, when Agamemnon threatens to take Achilles’ prize (γέρας), the woman Briseis, Achilles says that he does not intend to continue fighting ἄτιμος (‘without honor’, <em>Iliad</em> 1.171). As Casey Dué has noted, the dispute over prize women in <em>Iliad</em> 1 is actually about τιμή (<em>Iliad</em> 1.161, 1.174, 1.412, 1.503–510). This word is generally translated as ‘honor’, but it conveys specifically the honor heroes receive after death in cult and song as immortalized heroes (Dué 2002:45; see also Nagy 1979:118). In <em>Iliad</em> 9, Achilles, struggling with his mortality, rejects the gifts of Agamemnon and at the same time rejects the glorious death he will have in battle (<em>Iliad</em> 9.410–416). So too do the competitions for the prizes at the funeral games for Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23 have far greater significance than their material value. In <em>Iliad</em> 23.700–737, Ajax and Odysseus compete in wrestling, foreshadowing their competition for the arms of Achilles after his death and for the title of “best of the Achaeans.” In <em>Iliad</em> 23, neither can decisively defeat the other, and eventually Achilles calls the contest a draw, pronouncing that the victory (along with two equal prizes) belongs to both. (The individual contests have been analyzed by various scholars. See e.g. Douglas Frame’s analysis of the chariot race in Frame 2009:131–172 and further bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>) In <em>Iliad</em> 24, Achilles accepts a ransom for Hektor’s body, even though he knows that he too will soon be dead. He asks Patroklos not to be angry with him for accepting it, and says that they will share it equally (<em>Iliad</em> 24.589–595).</p><p>When we understand that prizes are inextricably linked with <em>kleos</em> in this tradition, we can better understand episodes in which heroes act in ways that we might call “selfish,” episodes which are often incompatible with modern notions of heroism (see e.g. Stanford 1965 <em>ad Odyssey</em> 9.229). The <em>Little Iliad</em>, according to Proklos, narrated the theft of the Palladion, a story that survives in several variant versions in which Diomedes or Odysseus or both try to get sole possession of it, betraying the other (see Gantz 1993:643–644). Likewise, Rick Newton (2008 and 2009) has discussed the way that Odysseus seeks gifts at the expense of his comrades throughout his adventures. Newton suggests that, in the <em>Odyssey</em>, guest-gifts function like a <em>geras</em> does in the <br/><em>Iliad</em>: guest-gifts, whatever their intrinsic material value, are tokens of honor and prestige for their recipient (cf. <em>Odyssey</em> 5.29–42 and 11.355–361). Odysseus’ heroic pursuit of guest-gifts generates delays in his homecoming and is instrumental in causing the death of his comrades along the way. See also Newton 2005, especially p. 141: “[In] Odyssean hospitality … the acquisition of property … enhances the honor and status of the hero … But that heroic hospitality, like successful warfare in the Iliad, comes at a price, and a high one … Odysseus will reach Ithaca late and alone.” An analogy can be made between the Iliadic deaths of countless Achaeans due to Achilles’ wrath over his stripped <em>geras</em> and the loss of Odysseus’ entire fleet and crew during his Odyssey <em>nostos</em>.</p><p>Note also that Nestor says there is <em>kleos</em> for undertaking a spying mission, making it parallel to fighting in battle. Nestor promises the sheep and a share at a banquet (see Nagy 1979:118–141 for connections between hero cult and portions at feasts), but the horses of Rhesos also become the reward and a visible sign of the success Diomedes and Odysseus achieve.</p>

<p>occurrences of <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em> ‘throughout humankind’: I.10.213 (with <em>kléos</em> [κλέος] at I.10.212); I.24.202 (with <em>kleesthai</em> [ἔκλε(ο)] at the same verse); I.24.535 (with <em>kekasthai</em> [ἐκέκαστο] at the same verse); O.01.299 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at O.01.298); O.03.252 (in this context, the question is where Menelaos was wandering when Agamemnon was killed by Aigisthos: the question is about that story, but the word for ‘story’ or ‘song’ here is not made explicit); O.14.403 (with <em>eükleiē</em> [ἐϋκλείη] at O.14.402); O.19.334 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at O.19.333); O.23.125 (there is a reference here to the storied fame of the <em>mētis</em> ‘intelligence, mind’ of Odysseus, but the word for ‘fame’ here is not made explicit); O.26.094 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at the same verse); O.24.201 (with <em>aoidē</em> [ἀοιδή] ‘song’: here the song about Klytaimestra is not glorious but inglorious); <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 82 with <em>poluōnumos</em> [πολυώνυμος] at the same verse: the temple of Apollo will have great fame and thus it will be ‘having many names’]</p><p>The syntax of this expression <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em>, meaning ‘throughout humankind’, is unusual in Homeric diction, since there are no obvious parallels to be found for the combination of the preposition <em>epi</em>, ordinarily meaning ‘on’, with the accusative of <em>anthrōpoi</em> ‘humans’. Here and in other occurrences of this expression, what holds the syntax together, it appears, is the idea of a song that spreads the remembrance or even the fame and glory of a story throughout all of humanity.

<p>ἒμ’ ὀτρύνει κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ</p><p>In a simile in <em>Iliad</em> 12, when Sarpedon is about to make his attack on the Achaean wall, we see a lion on ambush (<em>Iliad</em> 12.299–308). The lion is hungry, but it is nevertheless his audacious heart that bids him to attack the flocks and go to their densely packed enclosure (κέλεται δέ ἑ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ / μήλων πειρήσοντα καὶ ἐς πυκινὸν δόμον ἐλθεῖν, <em>Iliad</em> 12.300–301). He is desperate enough that he will make his attack even though the flocks are guarded by dogs and men. The formula θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ thus is used to indicate the motivation to undertake a particularly risky endeavor, and it seems to be used frequently, though not exclusively, for nighttime or ambush situations. Here, the nocturnal nature of the lion’s attack is not explicit, but is implied by the animals being in their pen and by the use of the adjective <em>pukinos</em> for that pen (see above on 10.5–9 for more on the associations between <em>pukinos</em> and ambush). Other examples of ambush contexts in which we see the formula θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ include the suitors’ plan to ambush Telemakhos (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.658), Odysseus preparing the wine-skin before he meets Polyphemos (<em>Odyssey</em> 9.213), and the ambushes Odysseus describes in one of his Cretan lies (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.217–219).

<p>Anthony Edwards (1985:22) identifies two leaders as a common feature of the Homeric ambush, and so Diomedes’ request for a partner may already indicate that the spying mission that Nestor proposed will become an ambush. Robert Rabel (1991, see esp. 288–291) sees an emphasis in <em>Iliad</em> 10 on cooperation among heroes in order to achieve success that contrasts strongly with Achilles’ choice to “go it alone” in <em>Iliad</em> 9. In Diomedes’ description of the ideal night raid team, νόος and νοέω are cited three times in three lines, together with μῆτις (cf. <em>Iliad</em> 23.590).

<p>We can compare this list with the list of those willing to duel with Hektor (after Nestor’s rebuke) in <em>Iliad</em> 7.162–168.

# Iliad 10.228

<p>Αἴαντε  </p><p>As discussed above on 10.53, at one time this dual referred to the fighting team of Ajax and Teucer, which would be a most appropriate meaning here. The dual, then, could mean not that Ajax son of Telamon and Ajax son of Oileus each individually volunteered (no other two warriors are listed as volunteering this way), but rather that Ajax and Teucer volunteered as a team. This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that two-horse chariot teams are described in the dual (as at 10.530–531), as are Diomedes and Odysseus when they are working as a unit, as we will see. (See below on 10.243.) Likewise, when Diomedes makes his case for taking a partner on the expedition (10.222–226), he uses the dual to describe the advantages of such a pair. The Aktorione-Molione, the possibly conjoined twins who fought Nestor in his youth (<em>Iliad</em> 11.709–752 and 23.638–642), are, of course, yet another pair of warriors who are described in the dual. The dual thus seems to be a traditional way of referring to a closely linked fighting team.</p><p>If the dual in this line is referring to Ajax and Teucer, then there is no mention of Ajax the son Oileus volunteering. We can speculate that in some performances of <em>Iliad</em> 10, especially those composed at a time when the dual was understood to refer to Ajax and Teucer, this dual meant that fighting team, although in our version Ajax son of Oileus is specifically named as someone to gather for the meeting at 10.110. It is worth noting that in <em>Iliad</em> 7.164, when the two Ajaxes are included among the heroes who volunteer to fight Hektor one-on-one, the form attested there is the plural, not the dual.</p>

<p>ὁ τλήμων Ὀδυσεὺς</p><p>On this epithet, Milman Parry offers the following:</p><p>The epithet τλήμων, found twice in the <em>Iliad</em>, presents a particular interest because it never occurs in the <em>Odyssey</em>, despite the greater importance of the role played by Odysseus in the latter poem. One might be tempted to see in it a word original with the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> or of the Doloneia, only the meaning of the epithet rules out such a conclusion. Like πολύτλας, τλήμων could never have been invented for the <em>Iliad</em>. It is an epithet whose origin is in some poem describing the wanderings of Odysseus, and which eventually came, like πολύτλας, to be applied to him under all circumstances. For in the <em>Iliad</em> Odysseus has not yet suffered more than other heroes. So we have here a formula indubitably deriving from the tradition and yet never used by the poet (or poets) of the <em>Odyssey</em>. Ought we to infer that the author of the <em>Odyssey</em> knew this formula but never had occasion to make use of it? It could be pointed out in support of this conclusion that the other words of these two lines are often found in the same position [citing 10.231 and 10.498, on which, see below]. It is also true that in the <em>Odyssey</em> Odysseus never has occasion to manage horses or to enter the throng of battle. But all this remains uncertain.</p><p>MHV 82</p><p>For more on the significance of this epithet, see below on 10.248, where we connect Odysseus’ epithets from τλάω with the endurance and daring required for ambush. Here, we see both semantic fields of the word at work: ὁ τλήμων Ὀδυσεὺς is followed in the very next line by the phrase: αἰεὶ γὰρ οἱ ἐνὶ φρεσὶ θυμὸς ἐτόλμα (“For the spirit [<em>thumos</em>] in his heart [<em>phrēn</em>] was always daring”; on the <em>thumos</em> as the motivator in risky undertakings, see also on 10.220 above). If we connect Odysseus’ epithet to the theme of ambush, we need not state with Parry that it could never have been invented for the <em>Iliad</em>, or assert that it is more appropriate for the Odyssey (Hainsworth 1993 <em>ad loc.</em>). Rather, it is appropriate in an ambush context, wherever that theme is invoked. On the significance of the definite article here, see Haft 1990:46–48 (with further bibliography <em>ad loc.</em>), who notes that although ὁ + epithet phrases are relatively rare in Homer, ὁ τλήμων Ὀδυσεὺς is one of four such phrases applied to Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, and should be understood as demonstrative (i.e. “that [well-known] enduring Odysseus”).

<p>Diomedes has to choose among the volunteers who are willing to accompany him on his nighttime spying mission. Agamemnon addresses Diomedes at this point, urging him to choose the hero who is truly most qualified, truly <em>aristos</em> ‘best’, I.10.236, and not to defer to someone who is superior in social status but inferior in heroic status, I.10.237–238. Agamemnon fears for the life of his brother, Menelaos, who is one of the volunteers, I.10.240. Evidently, Agamemnon fears that at least one of the other volunteers in fact superior to Menelaos. But the wording of Agamemnon betrays his own potential inferiority: he says explicitly to Diomedes that he should not chose a hero just because that hero may be <em>basileuteros</em> ‘more kingly’, I.10.239. The same wording, ironically, is used by Agamemnon in another context, where he claims superiority to Achilles himself on the grounds that he, Agamemnon, is <em>basileuteros</em> ‘more kingly’, Ι.09.160. In the present context, Agamemnon neglects to think of himself as a potential referent, since he was not one of the heroes who volunteered for the nighttime mission. See also I.09.392, where Achilles sarcastically uses the same word in rejecting the offer of Agamemnon: let the over-king choose as his son-in-law someone who is <em>basileuteros</em> ‘more kingly’ that I am.</p>

<p>τὸν ἄριστον</p><p>Agamemnon tells Diomedes to choose the “best” man. The question of who is the “best of the Achaeans” is a theme that runs throughout the <em>Iliad</em>, as Gregory Nagy has shown. In the catalogue of ships (<em>Iliad</em> 2.761), the narrator asks the Muses who was the best (<em>aristos</em>) of the Achaeans, and answers that it was Ajax, so long as Achilles had <em>mēnis</em> (2.768–769). But as Nagy points out, the claim to being best of the Achaeans is a disputed and divided one in the <em>Iliad</em>, precisely because the acknowledged best, Achilles, has withdrawn. The <em>Odyssey</em> tradition is not divided, however. There, Odysseus is the unquestioned best (Nagy 1979:26–35 and passim). So too in the Doloneia tradition is Odysseus the “best,” and here he is so in part because of his association with <em>nostos</em> ‘return, homecoming’, as Diomedes states explicitly (see below on 10.243).</p><p>An interesting correlation to this competition to be the “best” in epic is that ambushes feature the “best” men. (See also Edwards 1985:18–24.) There are several examples of the best men going on ambush in Homeric epic. Achilles states that Agamemnon does not go on ambush with the best (σύν ἀριστήεσσιν, <em>Iliad</em> 1.227). Idomeneus’ description of ambush involves a gathering of the best (ἄριστοι, <em>Iliad</em> 13.276). Those in the Wooden Horse are the best (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.272, 8.512–513, 11.523–524), and the best men are selected for ambushes of Bellerophon (<em>Iliad</em> 6.188), Proteus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.409), and Agamemnon (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.530–531). Even in a Cretan lie, Odysseus says that he used to choose the best men for ambush (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.217–218). We can also see that the best are involved in ambush warfare because both Odysseus and Achilles participate in nighttime ambushes (see “The Poetics of Ambush”).  </p>

<p>The narrator makes clear that Agamemnon is referring to his brother Menelaos when he advises Diomedes not to choose his partner based on social status. See above on 10.30–31 and 10.121 for how Menelaos is portrayed as not the best choice. It is, however, an unexpected argument coming from Agamemnon, who depends on social status for his authority, as we see in his dispute with Achilles in <em>Iliad</em> 1 (see also Wilson 2002 for her argument that Agamemnon relies on this kind of status). It is also Agamemnon who insists on his status as kinglier (βασιλεύτερός, 10.239) in Book 9 (160), arguing that Achilles should yield to him for that reason. (Although Odysseus leaves that argument out when he delivers Agamemnon’s offer to Achilles, Achilles seems to know it anyway, as he says in his response that Agamemnon should give his daughter in marriage to someone who is kinglier than he [<em>Iliad</em> 9.392].) This word thus provides a telling thematic contrast to the embassy, and perhaps is an indication that the two nighttime missions are performance alternatives of each other. We should also note that, in ambush, being the “best” is defined strictly in terms of the skills needed to be successful, and not in terms of social standing. The question of how to define the “best” that underlies the conflict between Agamemnon and Achilles is made explicitly moot for this spying mission.</p>

<p>This verse was omitted altogether in the text of Zenodotus (that is to say, it was not present in his text). It was present in the texts of Aristarchus, but he athetized it. The A scholia on these lines say that it was athetized because it is redundant (περισσὸς), tacked on (παρέλκων), and not in keeping with Homer’s <em>dianoia</em>, all of which are common reasons given in the scholia for athetesis. As noted above (see on 10.51–52), Alexandrian editors frequently drew on their own sense of what is appropriate and poetic to determine the authenticity of verses, and athetized those they felt were not in keeping with those standards. It was the practice of Aristarchus, however, to leave verses that were well attested in the texts available to him in his text, and to indicate by way of the athetesis mark his objection to them. Zenodotus’ text seems to have been considerably shorter than that of Aristarchus. We may compare 10.253, which received treatment similar to 10.240. It was omitted in the text of Zenodotus, and present but athetized in the texts of Aristarchus and Aristophanes of Byzantium. Martin West (2001a) has speculated that Zenodotus’ shorter text derives from an Ionian rhapsodic performance tradition, as opposed to the Athenian tradition on which the other Alexandrian editors seem to have relied. </p>

# Iliad 10.243

<p>This verse is also used at <em>Odyssey</em> 1.65 (and compare how the phrasing of <em>Odyssey</em> 1.66 is similar to that of 10.244). There, it is Zeus speaking in response to Athena, saying that he could not overlook Odysseus. Since <em>Iliad</em> 10, like the <em>Odyssey</em>, features Odysseus in a prominent role, the formula seems to be useful and good for introducing Odysseus in a starring role. </p>

# Iliad 10.243

<p>ἂν ἔπειτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην</p><p>Diomedes chooses Odysseus to go with him on the expedition, and that choice is marked in the formulaic language by a shift to the dual from 10.254 onwards, where the two heroes are understood to be a closely linked pair. (See also above on the dual Αἴαντε at 10.53 and 10.228.) The ensuing events of this book have long troubled scholars, who find the actions of Odysseus and Diomedes during this night raid to be un-Homeric and even un-heroic. (See “The Poetics of Ambush.”) But if we look at the Greek epic tradition as a whole, taking into account what we know of the now lost poems of the Epic Cycle, we find that Diomedes and Odysseus traditionally excel at the kind of ambush warfare depicted in <em>Iliad</em> 10. Diomedes is a stellar fighter in the <em>polemos</em>, but he is equally good at the <em>lokhos</em>. The sack of Troy is the ultimate night ambush, and both Odysseus and Diomedes are involved in several nighttime escapades leading up to and during its fall, including the following.</p><p>In testimonium 34 [Bernabé] of the <em>Cypria</em>, a lesser-known version of Polyxena’s story has her being wounded by Odysseus and Diomedes during the sack.</p><p>ὑπὸ Νεοπτολέμου φασὶν αὐτὴν (sc<em>.</em> Πολυξένην) σφαγιασθῆναι Εὐριπίδης καὶ Ἴβυκος. ὁ δὲ τὰ Κυπριακὰ ποιήσας φησίν ὑπὸ Ὀδυσσέως καὶ Διομήδους ἐν τῆι τῆς πόλεως ἁλώσει τραυματισθεῖσαν ἀπολέσθαι.</p><p>Scholia to Euripides, <em>Hecuba</em> 41</p><p>Euripides and Ibycus say that Polyxena’s throat was cut by Neoptolemos. But the composer of the <em>Cypria</em> says that she died after being wounded by Odysseus and Diomedes in the capture of the city.</p><p>In the <em>Little Iliad</em>, Odysseus seems to have been connected to the ambush and capture of Helenos, the prophetic son of Priam, and it is Diomedes, according to Proklos, who brings back Philoktetes from Lemnos. (Cf. Sophocles’ <em>Philoktetes</em>, where Odysseus is the one who goes to get him.) Philoktetes’ presence is required, according to Helenos, for the successful capture of Troy:</p><p>μετὰ ταῦτα Ὀδυσσεὺς λοχήσας Ἕλενον λαμβάνει, καὶ χρήσαντος περὶ τῆς ἁλώσεως τούτου Διομήδης ἐκ Λήμνου Φιλοκτήτην ἀνάγει.</p><p><em>Little Iliad</em>, from the summary of Proklos</p><p>After this Odysseus captures Helenos in an ambush, and as a result of Helenos’ prophecy about the city’s conquest Diomedes brings Philoktetes back from Lemnos.</p><p>Also narrated in the <em>Little Iliad</em>, according to Proklos, was the theft of the Palladion, which survives in several variant versions in which Diomedes or Odysseus or both try to get sole possession of it, betraying the other. The Palladion is yet another item that had been foretold to be required for the successful capture of Troy. In these ambush style episodes we find Odysseus and Diomedes frequently working as a team, though sometimes they split up the work or act on their own. As the episode with the Palladion suggests, the advantages of working as a team do not cancel out the desire on the part of each hero to obtain great glory for himself.</p><p>Still another attested collaborative ambush by Odysseus and Diomedes is the killing of Palamedes. In <em>Cypria</em> testimonium 30 [Bernabé], Diomedes and Odysseus drown Palamedes, ambushing him while he is fishing:</p><p>Παλαμήδην δὲ ἀποπνιγῆναι προελθόντα ἐπὶ ἰχθύων θήραν, Διομήδην δὲ τὸν ἀποκτείναντα εἶναι καὶ Ὀδυσσέα ἐπιλεξάμενος ἐν ἔπεσιν οἶδα τοῖς Κυπρίοις.</p><p>Pausanias 10.31.2</p><p>Palamedes was drowned when he went out to catch fish. Diomedes was the killer and also Odysseus, as I know from reading it in the epic poem the <em>Cypria</em>.</p><p>In all of these episodes Diomedes is linked, as in the Doloneia, with Odysseus. Indeed, Odysseus has long been understood to be the hero of <em>mētis</em>. (See on 10.137 and 10.148 above.) But it should not be forgotten that, like Diomedes, Odysseus has his fair share of traditional fighting. The <em>Odyssey</em> ends with Odysseus about to engage the families of the suitors in battle, and with Laertes rejoicing that he will have a contest for <em>aretē</em> with his son and grandson (<em>Odyssey</em> 24.515). When Demodokos sings about the fall of Troy in <em>Odyssey</em> 8, Odysseus is the hero raging “like Ares” through the streets of Troy (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.515). In <em>Iliad</em> 11.310–319, Odysseus and Diomedes together stave off a rout of the Greek forces before both are wounded. Recent scholarship has focused on the oppositions set up between <em>mētis</em> and <em>biē</em> in Homeric poetry (see e.g. Nagy 1979:45–48), but as Donna Wilson (2005) has recently pointed out, the two concepts are also complementary in many respects.  </p>

# Iliad 10.244

<p>πρόφρων κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ</p><p>At both 10.220 above and 10.319 below, the formula ἔμ’ ὀτρύνει κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ (“my heart and audacious spirit rouse me”) is used when Diomedes and Dolon, respectively, respond to the call for a spying mission. Here, Diomedes says that he is choosing Odysseus as his partner in the mission because his heart and audacious spirit are ready and eager for all kinds of labors; these personal qualities of courage and boldness are what impel men to go on nighttime or spying missions or on ambushes. We can compare the opposite in Achilles’ denunciation of Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 1.225–228, when he says that Agamemnon has the heart (κραδίη) of a deer and never arms himself for war or goes on an ambush with the best of the Achaeans, enduring it in his spirit (θυμός). It is clear that there is a deep-rooted association between these qualities and the daring feats of these types of missions. See also on 10.231 and 10.248.   </p>

<p>ἐκ πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο </p><p>Petegorsky points out that this particular image calls to mind “the background of Achilles’ challenge to the Achaeans to avert the danger that threatens the ships by employing μῆτις. His words acquire a strong ‘horizontal resonance’ by pointing back to Achilles’ challenge and forward to the Patrocleia [cf. <em>Iliad</em> 16.81]. And yet, his description of Odysseus also has a strong ‘vertical resonance’; for it evokes an image of Odysseus that corresponds remarkably well to that which we find in the <em>Odyssey</em>” (1982:193). The types of resonance that Petegorsky reveals remind us of how oral poetry can have complex ways of creating meaning that are different from those in written texts.  </p>

# Iliad 10.247

<p>ἄμφω νοστήσαιμεν, ἐπεὶ περίοιδε νοῆσαι</p><p>Odysseus’ primary heroic identity is concerned with <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, which is the subject of the epic devoted to him. (See Nagy 1979:35 and 38–39.) Douglas Frame has shown that the words <em>nostos</em> and <em>noos</em> ‘mind’ share the verbal root <em>*nes-</em>, whose meaning has to do with “returning to life and light” (a meaning best understood, according to Frame, in the context of solar symbolism), and that the two concepts are combined on a conceptual and verbal level throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>. (Cf. e.g. the opening lines of the <em>Odyssey</em>, 1.3–5: πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ <strong>νόον</strong> ἔγνω … ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ <strong>νόστον</strong> ἑταίρων [“Many are the cities of men and their <strong>ways of thinking</strong> he came to know, as he strove to win the life and <strong>homecoming</strong> of his companions.”]) See especially Frame 2005a and 2005b; on the root <em>*nes</em>, see also Frame 2009 and Bonifazi 2009. We can see that the deep connection between <em>nostos</em> and <em>noos</em> is built into the traditional character of Odysseus and comes into focus whenever he is featured, be it in the Iliad or the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p><p>We have already seen some indications (on 10.211–212) that spying missions share some traditional language and thematic associations with journeys. Diomedes’ choice of Odysseus as the master of the kind of journey called a <em>nostos</em> (due to his quality of <em>noos</em>) is another example of this commonality. See also below on 10.509.  </p>

# Iliad 10.248

<p>πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς</p><p>In this book Odysseus is also referred to as ὁ τλήμων Ὀδυσεὺς (“that enduring Odysseus,” 10.231 and 10.498; cf. <em>Iliad</em> 5.670 and <em>Odyssey</em> 18.319). Although Odysseus is <em>polutlas</em> ‘much enduring’ five times in the <em>Iliad</em>, the epithet is by far more common in the <em>Odyssey</em>, where it is naturally associated with the many travails he endures in that epic (cf. <em>Odyssey</em> 1.4: πολλὰ δ’ ὅ γ’ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα [“many are the pains he suffered”]). It is significant therefore that this formula appears directly following the verse in which Odysseus’ Odyssean association with <em>nostos</em> is conjured. But as we saw in our discussion of the etymologically related epithet τλήμων on 10.231, this formula may well have another aspect to it. When Achilles excoriates Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 1 for his lack of participation in the hardships of war, he says:</p><p>οἰνοβαρές, κυνὸς ὄμματ᾽ ἔχων, κραδίην δ᾽ ἐλάφοιο,</p><p>οὔτέ ποτ᾽ ἐς πόλεμον ἅμα λαῷ θωρηχθῆναι</p><p>οὔτε λόχον δ᾽ ἰέναι σὺν ἀριστήεσσιν Ἀχαιῶν</p><p><strong>τέτληκας</strong> θυμῷ<em>·</em> τὸ δέ τοι κὴρ εἴδεται εἶναι.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 1.225–228</p><p>“You drunkard, with a dog’s eyes and a deer’s heart,</p><p>whenever it comes to arming yourself for war with the rest of the warriors</p><p>or going on an ambush with the champions of the Achaeans,</p><p>you don’t have the heart to <strong>endure</strong> it. That looks like death to you.”</p><p>The verb Achilles uses is τέτληκα. In Idomeneus’ description of ambush warfare in <em>Iliad</em> 13 (discussed above, pp. 45–47), the verb τλάω is not used, but the need for endurance is likewise emphasized. Warriors on an ambush must endure fear, the discomfort of sitting/crouching as they wait for a long period of time to attack, and the cold of the night (as evidenced by the clothing chosen for ambush, clothing which Odysseus forgets to take both in <em>Iliad</em> 10 and in the story narrated in <em>Odyssey</em> 14). When Menelaos tells Telemakhos the story of the wooden horse in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, he praises Odysseus’ endurance (ἔτλη) on that occasion (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.271–272): οἷον καὶ τόδ’ ἔρεξε καὶ ἔτλη καρτερὸς ἀνὴρ / ἵππῳ ἔνι ξεστῷ (“What a thing he accomplished and endured, the mighty man, inside the wooden horse”). Odysseus’ steadfast character and ability to endure the <em>lokhos</em> are contrasted in Menelaos’ anecdote with that of the weaker-willed heroes, Diomedes, Menelaos himself, and Antiklos, all of whom Odysseus has to restrain from succumbing to Helen’s trick. In Odyssey 9, Odysseus describes how in the cave of the Cyclops he hid beneath the ram and held on, awaiting dawn “with an enduring heart” (τετληότι θυμῷ, 9.435; for this same formula in other ambush contexts, see also <em>Odyssey</em> 4.447 and 4.459, Menelaos’ ambush of Proteus, and <em>Odyssey</em> 24.163, the description by the shades of the suitors of how Odysseus ambushed them). This kind of waiting—during the dark of night, in a hiding position—is what a warrior undergoes in an ambush. When Athena tells Odysseus in <em>Odyssey</em> 13 that he will need to conceal his identity in order to take control of his home, family, and kingdom again, she tells him he will have to endure (σὺ δὲ τετλάμεναι καὶ ἀνάγκῃ, 13.307). He will have to take them by ambush, not outright force. (Cf. Odyssey 13.309–310: ἀλλὰ σιωπῇ / πάσχειν ἄλγεα πολλά, βίας ὑποδέγμενος ἀνδρῶν [“{You must} suffer many pains in silence, submitting to the <em>biē</em> of men.”]) Odysseus’ ability to withstand this particular kind of hardship is an important part of his epithet <em>polutlas</em>, and the endurance that Menelaos remembers as being so remarkable during the ambush of Troy is fundamentally connected to Odysseus’ ability to withstand the many <em>algea</em> he suffers on his journey home. (On the connection between the <em>tla-</em> compounds that describe Odysseus and the endurance required for ambush, see also Edwards 1985:17, and on the second half of the <em>Odyssey</em> as an ambush, see again Edwards 1985:35–37.)  </p>

But just as Ajax can be called best for battle so long as Achilles remains withdrawn (<em>Iliad</em> 2.768; Nagy 1979:27, 31), Odysseus here can contend for “best” at nighttime missions, since Achilles is not available now, either.  </p>

In any case, these lines call attention to the urgency of the time, as well as suggesting the possibility of multiple episodes during the same night.   </p>

# Iliad 10.254-272

<p>The passage that begins here functions much like an arming scene. In a well-known article, James Armstrong (1958) shows how formulaic arming scenes are employed at climactic moments in the <em>Iliad</em> with great effect. He analyzes in detail the four major arming scenes of the <em>Iliad</em> (those of Paris in <em>Iliad</em> 3, Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 11, Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 16, and Achilles in <em>Iliad</em> 19), arguing that formulaic language in these passages is manipulated for various poetic purposes, and that each scene resonates with what came before, so that there is a cumulative effect over the course of the poem.</p><p>In the night raid/<em>lohkos</em> tradition, the dressing and arming of heroes would no doubt have had a poetic purpose similar to the expanded arming scenes of conventional battle. These scenes contribute both to suspense, by increasing the audience’s anticipation of the coming ambush or raid, and to characterization, as the details of each dressing or arming passage reveal important aspects of the hero’s character as a fighter. But even more importantly, the passages serve to signal that the poet is moving into a different poetic register. The poet transitions by way of such scenes from one megatheme to another, and the alternative style of clothing is emblematic of not only this alternative mode of fighting but also an alternative poetics.</p><p>The armor described here is in many ways atypical. Most distinctive is what the heroes wear on their heads. Diomedes and Odysseus wear leather skull caps (κυνέην … ταυρείην … ἥ τε καταῖτυξ κέκληται—the word καταῖτυξ is used only here in extant Greek literature), and the history of Odysseus’ cap is elaborately described: Odysseus’ own maternal grandfather Autolykos stole it and gave it away as a gift to Amphidamas, who likewise gave it as a gift to Molos, who then gave it to the Cretan Meriones, who now gives it to Odysseus along with the other weapons Odysseus will carry, a bow and quiver and sword. Meriones must give Odysseus all of this gear because when Odysseus leaves his tent, unlike the other heroes who dress in skins and cloaks and take their weapons, he takes only his shield. (See above on 10.149.)</p><p>But both heroes, it should be noted, are given weapons and armor by the two leaders of the guards, Meriones and Thrasymedes, who came out into the night fully armed. Diomedes, we are told here, borrows a sword and shield from Thrasymedes, just as Odysseus uses Meriones’ bow, quiver, sword, and helmet. Such borrowing may reflect the impromptu nature of the mission—a quality that will be seen again when it changes from a spying mission to an ambush/night raid. Or it may give the mission a communal aspect, which can also be seen in the rest of the leaders remaining in this same spot, beyond the ditch, until Diomedes and Odysseus return. They are all invested in the success of these two.</p><p>But while the clothing they wear and weapons they carry are unusual for extant Homeric epic, they are completely appropriate for a night raid, where, unlike the <em>polemos</em>, it is important not to be conspicuous. (See also Shewan 1911:55.) The history of the cap as a gift indicates that such an object has prestige as well as utility, and possession of it may indicate “the best,” who would wear such equipment for these dangerous and important missions. That it was originally stolen by the thief extraordinaire Autolykos seems related to the stealth that it affords the wearer, and also makes it even more fitting both for Odysseus personally, who is very much like his grandfather, as we know from <em>Odyssey</em> 19.395–412, and for the night mission that requires stealth. Petegorsky (1982:200) also argues that the helmet connects all of these elements of Odysseus’ identity: “This helmet functions as a kind of identity marker for Odysseus, and it is in effect the equivalent of the scar in <em>Odyssey</em> Nineteen, which was the result of a wound inflicted on the hero by the tusk of a boar.”</p>

<p>ἀμφὶ δέ οἱ κυνέην κεφαλῆφιν ἔθηκε</p><p>Nowhere else in surviving Homeric epic do we find heroes putting on leather caps, but we must also recognize that no other expanded descriptions of night raids of this nature survive. If more of the Epic Cycle narratives describing Diomedes’ and Odysseus’ nighttime exploits survived (for these, see on 10.243 above), such items of clothing might not seem so exotic. In the Nisus and Euryalus episode in the <em>Aeneid</em>, Euryalus makes the fatal mistake of putting on the helmet that he takes as spoils from a corpse, and the reflection of the moonlight off the helmet gives him away to the enemy (<em>Aeneid</em> 9.373–374: “alea Euryalum sublustri noctis in umbra / prodidit immemorem radiisque aduersa refulsit”). Whereas heroes strive for conspicuous distinction (<em>kudos</em>) on the battlefield, ambush warfare is characterized by hiding and concealment. Cf. the Venetus B scholia on 10.258, which note that the kind of leather helmet worn here is ἄφαλον and ἄλλοφον “for being inconspicuous” (διὰ τὸ λανθάνειν).   </p>

<p>θαλερῶν αἰζηῶν ‘flourishing, vigorous young men’: Botanic imagery is used here to describe the warriors whose heads are protected by these helmets. The imagery of the hero as a plant that blossoms beautifully and dies quickly is an important theme in Greek lament traditions, as we see in Thetis’ lament for Achilles in <em>Iliad</em> 18.54–60 and in other passages throughout the <em>Iliad</em>. It is also a metaphor that encapsulates what glory means in the <em>Iliad</em>. One of the primary metaphors for epic song in the <em>Iliad</em> is that of a flower that will never wilt:</p><p>410  μήτηρ γάρ τέ μέ φησι θεὰ Θέτις ἀργυρόπεζα</p><p>διχθαδίας κῆρας φερέμεν θανάτοιο τέλος δέ.</p><p>εἰ μέν κ’ αὖθι μένων Τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι,</p><p>ὤλετο μέν μοι νόστος, ἀτὰρ κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται·</p><p>εἰ δέ κεν οἴκαδ’ ἵκωμι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν,</p><p>415  ὤλετό μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν</p><p>ἔσσεται, οὐδέ κέ μ’ ὦκα τέλος θανάτοιο κιχείη.</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9.410–416</p><p>410  My mother the goddess Thetis of the shining feet tells me</p><p>that there are two ways in which I may meet my end.</p><p>If I stay here and fight around the city of Troy,</p><p>my homecoming is lost, but my glory in song [<em>kleos</em>] will be unwilting:</p><p>whereas if I reach home and my dear fatherland,</p><p>415  my <em>kleos</em> is lost, but my life will be long,</p><p>and the outcome of death will not soon take me.</p><p>Here Achilles reveals not only the crux of this choice of fates around which the <em>Iliad</em> itself is built, but also the driving principle of Greek epic song. The unwilting flower of epic poetry is contrasted with the necessarily mortal hero, whose death comes all too quickly. (See especially Nagy 1979:174–184 and Dué 2006a:64–69. Nagy shows that the root <em>phthi</em>- in the Greek word <em>aphthiton</em> ‘unwilting’ is inherently connected with vegetal imagery, and means ‘wilt’.) The <em>Iliad</em> quotes within its narration of Achilles’ kleos many songs of lamentation that highlight the mortality of the central hero, as well as underscoring the immortality of song. The traditional imagery of these quoted laments spills over into epic diction itself, with the result that similes, metaphors, and other traditional descriptions of heroes are infused with themes drawn from the natural world, as here.</p><p>With Diomedes, Meriones, Neoptolemos, and even Achilles as examples, we might also argue that ambush is associated with younger men in particular, and thus the cap that is good for ambush is worn by young men. In the “Tradition and Reception” essay above we noted Gernet’s (1936) work on the Dolon myth, in which he argues that the episode is suggestive of initiation rituals in which young men must spend a period of time apart from society as well as other rites of initiation that take place at night. (See also Johnston 2002 on cattle raiding as a form of initiation; we have explored above in “The Poetics of Ambush” the thematic overlap between cattle raiding and ambush in Homeric epic.) The word <em>thaleros</em> used in this line to describe the young men may be important here. This word is used several times in Homer of husbands or young men and women on the verge of marriage. See e.g. the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 79, where Persephone is called a θαλερὴν ἄκοιτιν; <em>Iliad</em> 6.430, where <em>thaleros</em> is used of Hektor by Andromache and 8.190, used by Hektor of himself as the husband of Andromache; <em>Iliad</em> 4.474, where it is used of Simoesios, who dies before marriage—i.e. at the age when he should have been getting married; <em>Iliad</em> 3.26, where it is used of young hunters, who are likewise αἰζηοί; <em>Iliad</em> 8.156, where it is used of the Trojan husbands whom Diomedes has killed; <em>Odyssey</em> 6.66, where it is used of Nausikaa’s impending marriage; and <em>Odyssey</em> 20.74, where it is used of the requested marriage of the daughters of Pandareus. In the <em>Theogony</em>, it is used of Gaia’s first “husband” Ouranos, but there he is being described as the parent of Zeus. If we posit that ambush expeditions could serve as a rite of passage or form of initiation, it would explain why fear is said to be such an important factor: the success or failure of the mission would hinge on how the young men handled that fear. (See e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 13.277–278, where ambush is described as “the place where the merit of men most shines through, where the coward and the resolute man are revealed” and <em>Odyssey</em> 11.528–530. Both passages are discussed in “The Poetics of Ambush” above.)</p><p>  </p>

<p>βιὸν ἠδὲ φαρέτρην  </p><p>On the bow as a particularly appropriate weapon for night attacks, see the arguments of McLeod 1988. The Townley scholia at this line explain that Odysseus takes the bow so that he can shoot at those who are in the light (as the Trojans would be beside their campfires). McLeod adduces “half a dozen sources, spread over two millennia, testifying to a recurrent connection between the dark of night, the bow, and aiming at light” (McLeod 1988:123). The bow is of course also Odysseus’ signature weapon in the <em>Odyssey, </em>and similar to the lineage of the boar’s tusk helmet below (see 10.267), the bow that Odysseus leaves in Ithaka also has a particular story, being both an heirloom and guest-gift (<em>Odyssey</em> 21.13–41). Steven Farron succinctly describes the importance of the bow in that epic: “Odysseus boasts of his pre-eminence at military archery (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.215–222), establishes his right to Penelope with his skill at using the bow and it is his main weapon against the suitors” (Farron 2003:182). It has been argued (by e.g. Lorimer 1950:296–297 and 483) on this basis that <em>Iliad</em> 10 must be composed later than the <em>Odyssey</em>. On the problems with this argument, see “Interpreting <em>Iliad</em> 10.”</p>

# Iliad 10.263-264

<p>ἔκτοσθε δὲ λευκοὶ ὀδόντες / ἀργιόδοντος ὑὸς θαμέες ἔχον ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα  </p><p>As Hainsworth notes (1993 ad 10.261–265), “There is no doubt that a piece of bronze-age equipment is being referred to.” But how does this much-discussed example of Bronze Age material culture contribute to our understanding of the composition and poetics of the <em>Iliad</em>? Sherratt (1990:818) observes that the boar’s tusk helmet “though still occasionally found in graves as late as the 12th and 11th centuries, disappears from representational art of a military nature after 1200 BC.” (See also Lorimer 1950:212–219 and Stubbings 1962:516.) Is the boar’s tusk helmet evidence that Homeric poetry was being composed in the Bronze Age? Many scholars have rejected such a proposition, and instead have viewed this helmet as an instance of an eighth-century poet deliberately “archaizing” (on this concept, see e.g. Dickinson 1986, Kirk 1960:190ff., and Morris 1986:89ff.). Hainsworth questions whether the verses could survive from the Bronze Age, “their language being in no respect exceptionally archaic”; rather, he asserts that “[t]he poet of this book wanted to introduce an interesting and exotic object.” Those who see <em>Iliad</em> 10 as a particularly late composition are not inclined to accept that such an old object forms a natural part of this book, and instead prefer to see its inclusion as the work of an archaizing individual. But Sherratt (1990) has shown that, just as there are linguistic layers in the traditional language of Homeric poetry, so too are there archaeological layers that are not well explained by those who seek to isolate and dismiss individual Bronze Age relics as heirlooms or as products of deliberate archaizing. And just as the poetic diction evolved in such a way that we cannot easily separate out Aeolic language from Ionic (see above on 10.18), so too elements of disparate material cultures are integrated into the <em>Iliad</em> in such way that they can only be explained as the result of an evolving but also conservative process of oral composition, hundreds of years in the making. The arming scene of Odysseus and Diomedes in <em>Iliad</em> 10 is no different than countless other passages in the <em>Iliad</em> that include weapons from very different eras (see e.g. Sherratt 1990:810–811 on <em>Iliad</em> 19.369–391). Here, the boar’s tusk helmet seems to serve a poetic function beyond that of simply being an exotic object, for which see on 10.267.</p>

# Iliad 10.267

<p>Ἀυτόλυκος was Odysseus’ maternal grandfather. According to some traditions (Apollodorus 1.112, Pausanias 8.4.6, Ovid <em>Metamorphoses</em> 13.146), Autolykos is the son of Hermes (thus making Odysseus Hermes’ great-grandson). In <em>Odyssey</em> 19.395–396, Autolykos is said be a favorite of Hermes and “preeminent among men in thieving and perjury” (ἀνθρώπους ἐκέκαστο / κλεπτοσύνῃ θ’ ὅρκῳ τε), a gift given by Hermes himself. Odysseus is in turn a favorite of Autolykos (see <em>Odyssey</em> 19.393ff.). The relationship with Autolykos is one of many links that Odysseus has to the god Hermes, with whom he shares the epithet πολύτροπος (“of many turns,” <em>Odyssey</em> 1.1; <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 13). Hermes is the god described in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 13–18 as “crafty of counsel, a robber, a driver of cattle, a leader of dreams, a spy at night, a thief at the gates … Born at dawn, at mid-day he played the lyre, in the evening he stole the cattle of far-shooting Apollo.” Athena’s intelligence is central to the attested ambush episodes in Homeric epic (see on 10.275), but Hermes’ thieving and crafty ways play a vital role as well. (See also on 10.41 above for the use of the formula νύκτα δι᾽ ὀρφναίην in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 578.) Here Autolykos is said to have stolen the boar’s tusk helmet that Odysseus wears from a house that is <em>pukinos</em>. The house, in other words, is carefully and solidly built. Its many beams and planks are closely joined one upon the other, much as the boar’s tusks are made to fit seamlessly around the helmet. The word <em>pukinos</em> unites the <em>mētis</em> associated with Odysseus, his maternal grandfather, and Hermes with the cunning required to break into a well-built house and the craft required to construct such a helmet. The invocation of the history of Autolykos’ cunning thievery here thus places Odysseus’ own cunning in a continuum that stretches back through several generations, much as Diomedes’ role in the night raid of <em>Iliad</em> is placed in the context of his father Tydeus’ ambush history in 10.285–286. See 10.5–9 for more on the meanings of <em>pukinos</em>, especially as it relates to ambush.</p><p>For a similar “lineage” of an object of prestige, see the history of Agamemnon’s scepter at <em>Iliad</em> 2.101–108. The fact that the object was originally stolen does not seem to disqualify it from becoming a valued guest-gift.</p>

<p>πάντας ἀρίστους</p><p>In <em>Iliad</em> 7, Hektor challenges whoever is the best of the Achaeans (Ἀχαιῶν … ἄριστος, 7.50) to a duel, which at first only Menelaos accepts, followed (upon the reproach of Nestor) by Agamemnon, Diomedes, the two Ajaxes, Idomeneus, Meriones, Eurypylos, Thoas, and Odysseus. Here, many of the same heroes are being referred to as <em>aristos</em>, namely Agamemnon, the two Ajaxes (if Ajax the son of Oileus is indeed present, as he seems to be in our text; see above on 10.228), Idomeneus, and Meriones.

# Iliad 10.274

<p>ἐρῳδιὸν </p><p>This bird is a night heron. The Venetus A scholia says that it is an auspicious sign for Diomedes and Odysseus as they depart for clandestine activities and appropriate to the marshy area that they are in (see also 10.466–468 on the tamarisk bush for the marshy place of the ambush of Dolon, as well as “The Poetics of Ambush” for the kind of location where ambushes are often set up). The scholia in the Townley (T) manuscript, according to the edition of Maass, likewise call the bird a good sign for ambushers (ἀγαθὸν λίαν τὸ σημεῖον τοῖς ἐνεδρεύουσιν) and appropriate both because of the marshy place and because it hunts at night and is rapacious (νυκτὸς ἀγρεύει καὶ ἁρπακτικόν ἐστιν). The night heron does exhibit ambush-like behavior in its hunting: it waits while standing still for its prey to come into range at night and also plunders the nests of other birds (see e.g. <a href="http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0117 ">http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recnum=BD0117</a> or <a href="https://www.sdakotabirds.com/species/black_crowned_night_heron_info.htm">http://www.sdakotabirds.com/species/black_crowned_night_heron_info.htm</a>). But what we see in these scholia is part of a “system of associated commonplaces” (Black 1962:39 and above at 10.5–9) that the ancient audience would have had for this bird—namely, that the bird itself is an ambusher found in places used by warriors for ambushes—and those associations make it an appropriate omen. Such associations can be common without empirical evidence of the creature’s actual behavior. The fact that the bird is heard but not seen is also appropriate to the poetics of the night, where hearing is the predominant sense.</p><p>See Thompson 1895:58–59 for ancient sources on the ἐρωδιός: he notes that the heron is a symbol of Athena on coins. See also Pollard 1977:68–69 for this bird in general. Pollard notes a story from Aelian relating that Diomedes’ men were transformed into herons (Pollard 1977:164), and Vergil alludes to the story that Diomedes’ men were turned into some kind of bird at <em>Aeneid</em> 11.271–274. Other stories show evidence of a connection between herons and horses (Thompson 1895:59, Pollard 1977:167).</p><p>For another bird omen at night, compare the bird omen Zeus sends to Priam before he infiltrates the Achaean camp (<em>Iliad</em> 24.315–321). </p>

# Iliad 10.275

<p>Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη  </p><p>Walter Burkert describes Athena this way: “More than any other Greek deity, Athena is always near her protégés—‘Goddess of Nearness’ is how Walter F. Otto described her [Otto 1929/1956]. Wherever difficulties disappear and the impossible becomes possible, Athena is at hand, but her presence does not detract from the achievement of the other” (Burkert 1985:141). Athena is present for Odysseus throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>, and indeed she guides his entire <em>nostos</em> from the opening scene among the gods in Olympia to the conclusion of the strife on Ithaka in the final lines of Odyssey 24. They rival one another in cunning intelligence (<em>mētis</em>) and, as Burkert notes, Odysseus and Athena’s special relationship is exemplified by the way they reveal themselves to one another in <em>Odyssey</em> 13. Each knows the other by the false identity/lying tale that each offers to the other. Odysseus’ story is that he killed a man in Crete (by ambush—λοχησάμενος, 13.268) and fled, ending up in Ithaka. But Athena knows exactly who he is:</p><p>ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,</p><p>χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξε· δέμας δ’ ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ</p><p>καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ·</p><p>290  καί μιν φωνήσασ’ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·</p><p>κερδαλέος κ’ εἴη καὶ ἐπίκλοπος, ὅς σε παρέλθοι</p><p>ἐν πάντεσσι δόλοισι, καὶ εἰ θεὸς ἀντιάσειε.</p><p>σχέτλιε, ποικιλομῆτα, δόλων ἄατ’, οὐκ ἄρ’ ἔμελλες,</p><p>οὐδ’ ἐν σῇ περ ἐὼν γαίῃ, λήξειν ἀπατάων</p><p>295  μύθων τε κλοπίων, οἵ τοι πεδόθεν φίλοι εἰσίν.</p><p>ἀλλ’ ἄγε μηκέτι ταῦτα λεγώμεθα, <strong>εἰδότες ἄμφω</strong></p><p><strong>κέρδε’, ἐπεὶ σὺ μέν ἐσσι βροτῶν ὄχ’ ἄριστος ἁπάντων</strong></p><p><strong>βουλῇ καὶ μύθοισιν, ἐγὼ δ’ ἐν πᾶσι θεοῖσι</strong></p><p><strong>μήτι τε κλέομαι καὶ κέρδεσιν</strong>· οὐδὲ σύ γ’ ἔγνως</p><p>300  Παλλάδ’ Ἀθηναίην, κούρην Διός, ἥ τέ τοι αἰεὶ</p><p>ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοισι <strong>παρίσταμαι</strong> ἠδὲ φυλάσσω,</p><p>καὶ δέ σε Φαιήκεσσι φίλον πάντεσσιν ἔθηκα.</p><p>νῦν αὖ δεῦρ’ ἱκόμην, ἵνα τοι σὺν <strong>μῆτιν</strong> ὑφήνω</p><p>χρήματά τε κρύψω, ὅσα τοι Φαίηκες ἀγαυοὶ</p><p>305  ὤπασαν οἴκαδ’ ἰόντι <strong>ἐμῇ βουλῇ τε νόῳ</strong> τε …</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 13.287–305</p><p>So he spoke, and the goddess owl-radiant Athena smiled,</p><p>and took him by the hand.

So here too in <em>Iliad</em> 10 Athena is near to Odysseus, and he prays that she stand by him as she has done in the past (παρίστατσαι, 10.279). Note the same formula used in 10.279 and <em>Odyssey</em> 13.301: Athena there asserts that she does indeed stand by him in his many labors.</p><p>On Odysseus’ relationship with Athena in the <em>Iliad</em>, see also Haft 1990:42, who, in discussing the many parallels between <em>Iliad</em> 2 and 10, notes that Athena makes an epiphany to Odysseus in that book.

# Iliad 10.283

<p>βοὴν ἀγαθός</p><p>The epithet βοὴν ἀγαθός has been used four times in <em>Iliad</em> 10 already, for both Menelaos (10.36, 10.60) and Diomedes (10.219, 10.241), as it is used elsewhere for these heroes in the Homeric epics. We take the opportunity to examine in detail the epithet βοὴν ἀγαθός here because an argument has been made (Machacek 1994) that this particular use of it, in this line, has a special meaning, one that should make us reconsider Parry’s ideas about how epithets work in Homeric epic. Machacek’s article as a whole is a larger reconsideration of Parry’s work, from a stated position sympathetic to Parry (Machacek 1994:322). His basic argument pertaining to the use of this formula here is that “a great shout is a liability at this moment” (Machacek 1994:332)—as noise can indeed be in the night. Machacek argues further that this final use of the epithet in the book is contextually appropriate: once the Achaeans have departed on their mission, they will have to be quiet. Machacek makes several assumptions about the ancient audience’s reception of this episode, including the assumption that they would notice the absence of the epithet after this point, having noticed its use in previous lines (Machacek 1994:331–333). Before we deal with this argument any further, however, let us examine closely what Parry has to say about this epithet and others like it.</p><p>The epithet βοὴν ἀγαθός is what Parry calls a fixed epithet. The four characteristics of fixed epithets, as Parry describes them, are as follows:</p><p>a. (1) Fixed epithets are used in accordance with their metrical value and not in accordance with their signification;</p><p>b. (2) they are traditional;</p><p>c. (3) they are always ornamental;</p><p>d. (4) they are often generic.</p><p>And these four characteristics—a point which cannot be too much insisted on—are interdependent.</p><p>MHV 165–166</p><p>We will elaborate on what each of these characteristics means for our understanding of this traditional epithet, keeping in mind Parry’s point that they are all interdependent. We can see that βοὴν ἀγαθός is fixed because it is always used in the same position in the line: it follows the so-called weak or feminine caesura, where the previous word ends at the first short syllable of the third foot, and the first (short) syllable of βοὴν completes the third foot. This placement within the line is common for epithets, and Parry comments that βοὴν ἀγαθός fulfills the same purpose as other epithets that extend from the weak caesura to the bucolic diaresis (that is, where the word-end coincides with the end of the fourth foot), even though this epithet extends beyond the fourth foot (MHV 66). Because of its length, this epithet phrase is used most often with the same two names we see here in Book 10, Menelaos and Diomedes, which have the same metrical shape, ⏑ ⏑ ‒ Χ. (It is used with the name Diomedes in the <em>Iliad</em> at least twenty-one times; with Menelaos, at least fourteen times in the <em>Iliad</em> and at least eight times in the <em>Odyssey</em>.) But it has the flexibility to adorn other warriors’ names as well: Ajax, Hektor, and Priam’s son Polites are also given this epithet, which stays in its same position, while the rest of the line follows a different pattern, from small adjustments such as the inclusion of a τε before Polites’ name to greater differences in the metrical patterns for Hektor and Ajax. Thus, as Parry argues about these kinds of “rigorously” fixed epithets as a category, they “clearly must have had, for the poets who used them, an existence independent of any particular type of noun-epithet formula” (MHV 64–65). More controversial is Parry’s contention that the poet uses these epithets for metrical reasons rather than their signification. We will have more to say on this below.</p><p>The fixed epithet, as Parry says, is also traditional, having been used again and again over time once it was found to be useful for composing in performance. The principle of analogy applies here since the use of the epithet with more than one hero’s name is profitable for the singer in performance. Parry describes the process as occurring over time, within the tradition, and argues that we cannot discover which hero had this epithet originally:</p><p>To try to discover in which formula the use of a given epithet is oldest would be pointless. The significant fact is that the bards had no hesitation in applying to any hero an epithet which at some point in time had first been ascribed to one particular hero. It was used a first time for this one person; then it was used again for the same person, when the rhythm allowed it and made its use easy. Then the bards applied it to other persons whose names were of the same metrical value with that of the original owner.</p><p>MHV 87</p><p>There are five names in the <em>Iliad</em> that are given this epithet, but if we had more of the epic tradition, we might see it used even more widely. Conversely, if we had only the <em>Odyssey</em>, we would consider this epithet to belong solely to Menelaos. We must be mindful of the limitations of our data when it comes to the larger tradition.</p><p>This epithet is also ornamental, meaning that it is not being used in a context in which the warrior is actually shouting in battle. The non-ornamental epithet is one Parry terms “particularized,” meaning that it is essential to the context, and to completing the thought of the sentence (see MHV 158–164 for more on particularized epithets). A typical example of an ornamental use of this epithet is found at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.307, which describes Menelaos as βοὴν ἀγαθός as he awakes, gets out of bed, and gets dressed at home in Sparta, not displaying any of his shouting prowess. Similarly, the uses here in <em>Iliad</em> 10 do not accompany any battlefield cries. There is one case in which the epithet is followed by a shout on the battlefield: in <em>Iliad</em> 17, when Ajax and Menelaos are protecting the corpse of Patroklos, Ajax asks Menelaos to call others to help them. Menelaos is called βοὴν ἀγαθός in both the lines that open and close Ajax’s request (<em>Iliad</em> 17.237, 246). Menelaos then gives a loud, piercing shout to the Danaans (ἤϋσεν δὲ διαπρύσιον Δαναοῖσι γεγωνώς, <em>Iliad</em> 17.247). Here, then, we might think the epithet is particularized to the context, since Menelaos is demonstrating his battle-cry. One objection to that idea, however, might be that, with a different vocabulary and purpose—a cry for help—this kind of shout is not the same as the battle shout. But that distinction is not what would matter to Parry, for he says of ornamental epithets like βοὴν ἀγαθός: “After what we have learned of the ornamental meaning of the Homeric epithet, we must recognize the principle that an epithet used in a given noun-epithet formula cannot sometimes be ornamental, sometimes particularized: <em>it must always be one or the other</em>” (original emphasis, MHV 156).</p><p>Finally, this epithet is also generic. The fixed epithet, according to Parry is also often (though not always) a generic epithet; that is, it is used in noun-epithet formulas without specific characterization of the person it is applied to. Just as the ornamental epithet is contrasted with the particularized, in this case, the generic epithet is the opposite of the distinctive epithet in Parry’s terminology. Distinctive epithets are those used for only one hero. In fact, Parry uses βοὴν ἀγαθός as an example of a generic epithet with a general meaning: “The expression βοὴν ἀγαθός will, if used of only one hero, say Diomedes, assign to that hero an unusual power of voice, just as ποδάρκης assigns to Achilles a singular swiftness; said of any hero whatever, the expression will mean no more than ‘good at the war-cry as ordinary men are not’” (MHV 146). This idea of the generic meaning of an epithet, especially in combination with Parry’s assertion that the fixed epithet is used for its metrical value rather than its signification in context, has elicited strong reactions from critics.</p><p>But let us notice first that Parry does not say here that this epithet has no meaning at all; he says only that it does not specify one hero in a way that it specifies no other hero. In other words, the heroes designated βοὴν ἀγαθός are, indeed, good at the battle shout. The fact that more than one hero is so designated suggests that such a skill would have been considered a good and useful one for a warrior, just as the formula itself is good and useful for the singer who is composing in performance. And let us also note that there are situations, such as Menelaos getting out of bed at home in Sparta, in which the epithet carries no immediate meaning for the immediate context. In these situations, especially, Parry’s arguments were most illuminating when he first made them, and they freed the critic from spending any more time or energy trying to come up with a reason that the immediate context called for this particular epithet.</p><p>With those important insights in mind, we can turn to the more controversial idea that the poet chooses a fixed epithet such as this for metrical purposes. Parry expresses this idea in two ways: first, he argues that, if a generic epithet is applied to several heroes, it is chosen “not according to the character of the hero, but according to the metrical value of his name” (MHV 95). According to this argument, Menelaos and Diomedes both share this trait because their names have the same metrical value. Second, he argues that the metrical shape of the beginning of the line (in this case, that which ends at the weak caesura) determines which epithet is used in that particular line. In other words, heroes acquire certain epithets according to the metrical value of their name, and then which epithet is used in a particular line is determined by the other words in that line. But as we have already seen, this fixed epithet, even as it stays in the same metrical position, can be used for heroes whose names have different metrical values, such as Ajax or Hektor. And the poet is of course shaping the rest of line using the traditional, formulaic language he commands: the use of this language by a skilled singer is as natural as using spoken language is for anyone fluent in it, including the use and creation of formulas by analogy, as Lord has eloquently argued (Lord 1960/2000:30–36). Additionally, as scholars who have followed Parry and Lord have gone on to demonstrate more fully, thought precedes meter in Homeric diction. Meter and formulas do not imprison the poet (see e.g. Nagy 1996b:22–25 and Foley 2002:133–134).</p><p>There are additional factors that we need to consider as we use and evaluate Parry’s work on epithets. One is that Parry himself did not live to complete his work on Homeric poetry, dying at the young age of thirty-three. Thus the emphasis, seen all too often in scholarly discussions, on his “failures” or the limitations of what he accomplished is, to be frank, unfair. More egregious, however, is treating Parry’s work as though nothing has come after it, when its issues and questions have been thoroughly addressed and its insights expanded upon by generations of scholars. To properly evaluate Parry’s work, these subsequent studies must also be acknowledged and accounted for.[1]</p><p>With that in mind, how should we understand this use of the epithet, or the four others in this Book, or those in the Homeric epics overall? As we have already noted, the epithet has a general meaning for a warrior with a particular skill. For the heroes who are given this epithet, it has a larger meaning within the epic tradition as a whole: although we may not see the heroes shouting at the times when they receive the epithet, within the tradition as a whole, it tells us something about what kind of a warrior the hero is. This larger meaning has already been noted by Parry (MHV 137–138) and Lord (1960/2000:65–67), and both the concept of a formula’s traditional meaning and its significance for the poetics of the epics have been expanded upon by Nagy, Foley, and many others. (See the discussion above on the epithet ποιμένα λαῶν at 10.3.)</p><p>We can now return to the question of whether this particular use of the epithet has a contextual meaning in connection with the need for silence on an ambush. Machacek’s argument implicitly understands this aspect of the poetics of ambush, the need for stealth and quiet. In fact, in the earlier episode of this night, Agamemnon asks his herald to summon the Achaeans for an assembly, but tells him not to shout (μηδὲ βοᾶν, <em>Iliad</em> 9.12), indicating that, even at that point in the night, and even within the encampment, only quiet speaking is appropriate. This need for quiet and stealth, however, prompts the question of whether the epithet should be used at all during night episodes if its meaning is felt to be tied so closely to the current circumstances, as Machacek suggests it is. His answer is that the singer uses it four times in Iliad 10 precisely so that the audience will notice its absence in the rest of the book, when Diomedes is actually on the mission. Machacek proposes that the audience members even “listened carefully to see if he [the singer] would slip up and so describe Diomedes” (Machacek 1994:332). Beyond being an odd conception of the relationship between the singer and audience—in which the audience’s reception is focused on waiting for the singer to make a mistake, and a “literary” mistake at that—such a formulation also misunderstands the important point that the audience, as well as the singer, knows Diomedes to be well-known for his battle shout at all times, whether or not he is shouting (and in all instances where Diomedes gets this epithet in <em>Iliad</em> 10, he is not).</p><p>Instead, we have to recognize that this epithet is not particularly associated with the ambush theme, even though it is used several times in this particular ambush episode. On some deeply felt level, but perhaps not an immediate one, the audience would associate this epithet with Diomedes’ (and Menelaos’) prowess as a warrior in the <em>polemos</em>, where the battle shout is appropriate, and they would know from hearing many episodes from the Trojan War, and perhaps even the Theban epic tradition, that Diomedes is a warrior who excels at both <em>polemos</em> and <em>lokhos</em>. (See also our discussion of Diomedes in these terms in “The Poetics of Ambush.”) In some ways, though, the uses of this epithet reaffirm Parry’s own observations about how epithet formulas, in particular, can be used in situations in Homeric poetry where they would seem odd or even contradictory in poetry that was not oral and traditional. The singer was not forced by metrical considerations to use this formula, but it was useful for the composition of this Book, even though a battle shout happens nowhere in the episode itself and Diomedes, as well as Odysseus, avoids making excessive noise.</p><p>There is one other major methodological problem with Machacek’s argument: it is predicated on this line containing the final instance of this epithet formula. When we consult modern editions of <em>Iliad</em> 10, this can easily appear to be the case. But when we consider the full range of evidence, including papyri and the scholia, and when we fully grasp what composition-in-performance means for the multiformity of the epic tradition (for more on these topics, see our essay “<em>Iliad</em> 10: A Multitextual Approach”), we see that such arguments about epithets in particular can be refuted on an empirical basis. On the papyrus that both Allen and West refer to as “p90” (Oxyrhynchus 6.949 from the second–third century CE), there is a possible use of this epithet again at 10.446: [τον δ ημειβετ επειτα βοην αγα]θος Διομηδης, which would put it squarely in the middle of the mission, after Diomedes and Odysseus have captured Dolon. And from the scholia to both the Venetus A and Townley manuscripts, we hear of a version of 10.349, known to the Homeric critic Aristophanes, that also uses this epithet: ὣς ἔφατ’, οὐδ’ ἀπίθησε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Διομήδης. (See our textual commentary, on the the Venetus A text, p. 217, for more on this multiform.)</p><p>Since name-epithet formulas were so useful, flexible, and traditional—all qualities that Parry himself identifies—it is difficult to prove the argument that the absence of one in a particular passage is significant: even with our limited evidence we can see that this epithet could indeed be used again in this episode, and that doing so would not be considered a “mistake” that an audience would find out of place. Instead, a thorough understanding of the oral traditional poetics of these formulas requires us to take a larger view of their meaning, just as an understanding of the textual tradition requires us to take into account all the evidence we have and to recognize that a singer might have sung this same episode with the variation natural to composition-in-performance. These are some of the differences between Homeric epic and modern poetry that Parry enjoins us to acknowledge and to appreciate with a different aesthetics.</p><p>    </p><p>[1] For a concise bibliography of scholarship since Parry that seeks to appreciate the creativity of a poet working within a traditional medium, see Martin 1989:151n16.

# Iliad 10.284

<p>Διὸς τέκος Ἀτρυτώνη</p><p>As an epithet of Athena, Ἀτρυτώνη is used within the epic tradition for direct address: in our texts, she is addressed this way either by Hera (<em>Iliad</em> 2.157, 5.714, 21.420) or by a mortal praying to her (Diomedes here and at <em>Iliad</em> 5.115; Penelope at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.762; Odysseus at <em>Odyssey</em> 6.324). The Venetus A manuscript at <em>Iliad</em> 2.157 has a gloss written directly above this epithet that says “inexhaustible” (ἀκαταπόνητε). In all of these cases the name is part of an extended formula Διὸς τέκος Ἀτρυτώνη, and in all other instances besides this αἰγιόχοιο precedes Διὸς (see 10.278 for a use of the formula αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος without Ἀτρυτώνη). Thus the formula is one we see regularly throughout the epics, and it is therefore an example of the traditional nature of the language of <em>Iliad</em> 10. But should we find the absence of αἰγιόχοιο in this line evidence of nontraditional usage? We would argue no, since what actually seems to alter the compositional needs of this line is the fact that this is the second in a two-fold prayer to Athena (“Hear now <strong>also me</strong>”), which is not the case in the other attested examples.</p><p>Wherever this formula is used, Athena is reported as having listened to the prayers of the mortals who address her as such (see <em>Iliad</em> 5.121, <em>Iliad</em> 10.295, <em>Odyssey</em> 4.767, and <em>Odyssey</em> 6.328). When Hera addresses her with this epithet, Athena springs into action to do whatever Hera has asked after that initial address. Thus within the tradition it seems a particularly effective way to address the goddess in order to gain her attention. Formulas involving the gods are used especially in prayer contexts (Parry MHV 77–78, 181–182), and this one should be counted among them.  </p>

# Iliad 10.285-290

<p>Another rich epic tradition, one centered on the city of Thebes, is alluded to here, as it is at other places in the <em>Iliad</em>. The story of the Seven Against Thebes seems to have been a parallel epic tradition to that of the Trojan War, out of which the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> emerged: Hesiod refers to these two wars as those fought by the generation of Heroes (<em>Works &amp; Days</em> 161–165). Yet, because the ancient Greek epics known as the <em>Thebaid</em> and <em>Epigonoi</em> are not extant, with only a few fragments surviving in other sources, the <em>Iliad</em> is one of our best and earliest sources for this tradition. The <em>Iliad</em> refers to this other tradition in some detail not only here, but also at <em>Iliad</em> 4.376–410, <em>Iliad</em> 5.800–808, <em>Iliad</em> 6.222–223, and <em>Iliad</em> 14.113–126. (See Gantz 1993:502–525 for other sources.) These <em>Iliad</em> passages refer to two different wars on Thebes. The first attack is instigated by the Theban Polyneikes (son of Oedipus) after his brother Eteokles denies him his share of the kingship of Thebes. Polyneikes then gathers a large military force with the help of his father-in-law Adrastos of Argos and Tydeus, Diomedes’ father, who is also an exile from his native city Kalydon (see <em>Iliad</em> 14.115–120). The other leaders vary according to the source, but can include Kapaneus, Amphiaraos, Parthenopaios, Eteoklos, Hippomedon, Mekisteus, and Lykourgos. The Seven are defeated at Thebes, as is at least implied at <em>Iliad</em> 4.405–409, <em>Iliad</em> 6.222–223, and <em>Iliad</em> 14.114. The second war was one of revenge by the sons of the Seven, called the <em>epigonoi</em>, some time later, when the sons reached manhood (Diomedes tells Glaukos he never knew his father because he was so young when Tydeus died at Thebes, <em>Iliad</em> 6.222–223). The sons who fight at Thebes include Diomedes and his daytime fighting partner Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus. As Sthenelos indicates, they are successful in sacking Thebes (see <em>Iliad</em> 4.403–410). Thus these two are a link between the two epic traditions, since they fight both at Thebes and at Troy. In an oral performance tradition, the singer can allude to the subject matter of other epics in this kind of compressed way and expect an audience to understand the allusion (see further on 10.289–290 below).</p>

# Iliad 10.285

<p>σπεῖό … ἕσπεο  </p><p>Within the epic tradition this verb can have a marked meaning, signifying a god who accompanies a hero and gives him special protection or help. We see the same verb later indicating that Athena is indeed accompanying (ἕπουσαν, 10.516) Diomedes—Apollo is said to see her doing so. Athena has already signaled her presence through a bird sign (10.274–275), and will later speak to Diomedes (10.507–512), although she remains unseen throughout. In other cases, Athena “accompanies” mortals in disguise: at <em>Odyssey</em> 2.287 while disguised as Mentor she offers to accompany Telemakhos on his journey, and at <em>Odyssey</em> 6.32 appearing to Nausikaa in a dream in the guise of the daughter of Dymas she says she will accompany her. (Although she does not go with Nausikaa in this form, she is present at the washing place.)</p><p>Parallel to Athena accompanying Diomedes and Odysseus on this night mission, Iris tells Priam in a dream that Hermes will accompany him on his night mission to the Achaean camp to ransom Hektor’s body (<em>Iliad</em> 24.182), and of course, Hermes does so in disguise (see above on 10.1ff. for more on how Priam’s mission is similar to the ambush theme). Thus we find that this particular use of the verb for gods accompanying mortals has associations with dreams, disguise, and night missions. As we have noted in “The Poetics of Ambush,” there is thematic overlap between such missions and journeys. Therefore, in addition to Athena saying she will accompany Telemakhos on his journey at <em>Odyssey</em> 2.287, we can also include among the examples of this theme Nestor’s proclamation that the gods in general accompany Telemakhos on his journey: τοι νέῳ ὧδε θεοὶ πομπῆες ἕπονται (<em>Odyssey</em> 3.376). Athena has a special relationship with Odysseus (see the commentary on 10.275 for more on that relationship), and that intimacy extends to his son. Here, Diomedes asks for the same kind of consideration based on her relationship with his father. We know that Diomedes indeed has such a relationship with Athena from <em>Iliad</em> 5. See also 10.291.</p><p>Finally, we may compare this use of ἕπομαι for god and mortal pairs to its use for teams of warriors; it is used not only of the team of ambushers here in <em>Iliad</em> 10 (10.222, 10.227, 10.246), but also of warriors who team up in daytime battle, as at <em>Iliad</em> 11.472, 15.559, and 16.632. In each of those latter cases, the one warrior asks the other to join him in pushing the enemy back, and when the second follows/accompanies him, he is called “a man equal to a god,” using the same formula: ὣς εἰπὼν ὃ μὲν ἦρχ’, ὃ δ’ ἅμ’ ἕσπετο ἰσόθεος φώς (“So speaking he led the way and the other man, equal to a god, accompanied him”). </p>

# Iliad 10.288

<p>μειλίχιον μῦθον</p><p>The semantic range of μειλίχιος when used to describe words or speech is a broad one. Kind or gracious words are used to persuade or encourage. The adjective modifies both <em>muthos</em> (used three times) and even more often <em>epos</em> (used nineteen times) in our texts. It is also used as a substantive with the verb προσηύδα (used three times) to indicate this kind of speech. These persuasive words are used between friends. The one context in which this is patently not the case is informative because it uses its antonym to indicate how unsuccessful such persuasion can be between enemies. At <em>Iliad</em> 11.137 two Trojans, Peisandros and Hippolokhos, beg Agamemnon in battle to ransom them as prisoners of war rather than kill them. The narrator says they use gracious speech in their request, but hear an ungracious voice in response (ὣς τώ γε κλαίοντε προσαυδήτην βασιλῆα / μειλιχίοις ἐπέεσσιν· ἀμείλικτον δ’ ὄπ’ ἄκουσαν, <em>Iliad</em> 11.136–137). Agamemnon refuses their pleas and kills them (compare <em>Iliad</em> 21.98 for a similar refusal also termed an “ungracious voice in response”).</p><p>As we will discuss further below (see 10.542), the semantic range of μειλίχιος also includes speech between friends in which the adjective is used with words of welcome (see also <em>Odyssey</em> 19.415 and 24.393). Similarly, Diomedes uses such words with Glaukos once he realizes that their grandfathers were guest-friends (<em>Iliad</em> 6.214).</p><p>This last example brings us to contexts where the words are used to address those who are, could be, or should be friends, but who either are or could be angry with or hostile to the speaker. For example, Helen speaks to Hektor this way when he comes to retrieve Paris, and her words are meant to show him her shame at her own conduct as well as that of Paris (<em>Iliad</em> 6.343; see Ebbott 1999 for more on the way Helen’s shame is portrayed in the <em>Iliad</em>). When Odysseus and Nausikaa see each other, he wonders what would be the best way to approach her: to supplicate her by taking hold of her knees, or stand further off and use gracious words (ἐπέεσσιν ἀποσταδὰ μειλιχίοισι, <em>Odyssey</em> 6.143). He decides on this second option because if he clasps her knees (naked as he is), she might get angry (<em>Odyssey</em> 6.145–147), and so he speaks a gracious and cunning speech (μειλίχιον καὶ κερδαλέον φάτο μῦθον, <em>Odyssey</em> 6.148), which, of course, he hopes will persuade her to help him.</p><p>In addition to these cases of such words meant to assuage or forestall someone’s anger, we have two final examples that are even closer to the case of Tydeus and therefore help us understand the traditional story behind his embassy to the Thebans. Odysseus speaks with such words to Ajax in the underworld, hoping to persuade his friend turned enemy to speak with him (τὸν μὲν ἐγὼν ἐπέεσσι προσηύδων μειλιχίοισιν, <em>Odyssey</em> 11.552). And Nestor proposes approaching Achilles with these kinds of words as well as with gifts to persuade him to return (δώροισίν τ’ ἀγανοῖσιν ἔπεσσί τε μειλιχίοισι, <em>Iliad</em> 9.113). Once we see the wide range of contexts in which this kind of speech can be used, we understand better that Tydeus is sent as a messenger to the Thebans in order to persuade them, and that he comes as a friend to friends who may nevertheless be hostile to him (as indeed they turn out to be). Tydeus comes on behalf of Polyneikes, of course, who was supposed to share the kingship of Thebes with his brother Eteokles. When Tydeus’ words of persuasion (presumably, urging him to follow this original arrangement) fail, he is later ambushed. The attack of the Seven against Thebes will be the next step. But we can infer that Tydeus’ speech, if we had an example of it from an ancient epic about the Theban war, would have started from a friendly stance and would have been gracious toward Eteokles and the Thebans.  </p>

# Iliad 10.289-290

<p>This allusion provides a good illustration of the workings of the <em>Iliad</em>’s performance context. Diomedes says only that Tydeus is able to “mastermind astounding deeds” with Athena’s help on this occasion, without any further detail needed for his internal audience, since Athena would know what happened. A traditional audience of the <em>Iliad</em>, however, would also readily know the events to which Diomedes refers, and this compressed reference would evoke the entire episode for them, whereas we have to try to reconstruct it as best we can. As we have seen, this episode is also related to Diomedes by Agamemnon at <em>Iliad</em> 4.382–398 and Athena at <em>Iliad</em> 5.800–808 as they both try to spur him on to live up to his father’s fighting prowess. As we saw above on 10.48, the phrase <em>mermera erga</em> refers to one man defeating many more, and Tydeus does this twice, in fact, when he is sent alone to Thebes as a messenger. In <em>Iliad</em> 4 and 5, we learn that Tydeus challenges the Thebans to athletic contests, and defeats them all easily, because Athena helps him (<em>Iliad</em> 4.389–390 ≈ 5.807–808). But in <em>Iliad</em> 4, Agamemnon continues the story by saying that the Thebans in retaliation send fifty men to ambush Tydeus (they go on a πυκινὸν λόχον, <em>Iliad</em> 4.391–393; see above at 10.5–9 for the implications of <em>pukinos</em> in an ambush context). Tydeus defeats them as well, slaying all of them except for Maion, whom he intentionally leaves alive in obedience to the portents of the gods (<em>Iliad</em> 4.396–398). The A scholia on <em>Iliad</em> 4.394 inform us that “some guess that Maion was a herald, and for that reason he alone was saved.” Nevertheless, Tydeus’ status as <em>angelos</em> does not protect him from being attacked. In his much later (and Latin) epic <em>Thebaid</em>, Statius portrays Maion as a seer, and Tydeus makes him a herald by default, giving him the message to take back to Thebes to prepare for war (<em>Thebaid</em> 2.682–703).</p><p>We see here that, in addition to <em>mermera erga</em> indicating one man defeating many, it can apply to either daytime fighting in open battle (as in the case of Hektor above [10.48] and at <em>Iliad</em> 11.502, in the case of Achilles at <em>Iliad</em> 21.217, and in Zeus’ phrase πολέμοιό τε μέρμερα ἔργα at <em>Iliad</em> 8.453) or nighttime/ambush fighting, as in this case and also below on 10.524. Here and on 10.48, these astounding deeds are associated with verbs like μήδομαι (10.52 as well as this line) and μητίομαι (10.48), so whether daytime battle or nighttime ambush, whether attacker or attacked, such success against greater numbers can be thought of as “devised” or “masterminded.” Also, in this case, the fact that one ambusher is left alive is a significant detail. In the poetics of ambush, there is narrative tension surrounding the possibility of not knowing what happens to those who go on a spying mission, an ambush, or another nighttime expedition unless they return successfully. Maion’s return, although apparently granted by the gods, is also necessary for Tydeus’ victory to be known.</p><p>This allusion indicates that ambush was a theme in the Theban epic tradition as well. Like Bellerophon (<em>Iliad</em> 6.187–190), Tydeus is successful in defeating the ambushers even though he is vastly outnumbered. Another night episode within this tradition that shares features with <em>Iliad</em> 10 is Tydeus’ arrival in Argos after his exile. The scholia to <em>Iliad</em> 4.376 from the Venetus A relate the story that both Tydeus and Polyneikes arrive at the house of Adrastos at night, each wearing an animal skin, like those of the heroes in <em>Iliad</em> 10. Tydeus wears a boar skin, and Polyneikes a lion skin. Adrastos had received an oracle that he should marry his daughters to a lion and a boar, and seeing these men on his doorstep he realizes that they should be his sons-in-law. As we have argued above, the wearing of animal skins puts the episode in a distinct register. The connection to the animals mentioned in the oracle plays off that register, by making the meaning of the skins symbolic in a more particular way. See also the commentary on Dolon’s wolf skin at 10.334.</p>

# Iliad 10.291

<p>ὡς νῦν μοι ἐθέλουσα παρίστασο καί με φύλασσε</p><p>As we saw with the verb ἕπομαι on 10.285, Athena in particular is a goddess who stands by and protects the heroes she favors. She asserts to Diomedes on the battlefield that she indeed does what he asks her to do in his prayer: σοὶ δ’ ἤτοι μὲν ἐγὼ παρά θ’ ἵσταμαι ἠδὲ φυλάσσω (“Indeed I stand by you and guard you,” <em>Iliad</em> 5.809). In the <em>Odyssey</em>, she claims the same thing to Odysseus, using the same verbs: ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοισι παρίσταμαι ἠδὲ φυλάσσω (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.301). For the use of παρίσταμαι we can also compare the use of this same verb at <em>Odyssey</em> 3.222, when Nestor tells Telemakhos that Athena used to stand beside Odysseus openly: ὡς κείνῳ ἀναφανδὰ παρίστατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη. (See above on 10.275 and 10.278–279 for more on Odysseus’ relationship with Athena.) Thus this line is yet another clear example of the traditional language in <em>Iliad</em> 10. Diomedes requests Athena’s assistance here on the basis of that which she had given his father, and when Athena uses this combination of verbs at <em>Iliad</em> 5.809, it is also in the context of a comparison between Tydeus and Diomedes. Thus we see again (cf. 10.285) a patrilineal continuation of Athena’s special protection of her favorite heroes.  </p>

<p>These lines are the same as those found in our texts at <em>Odyssey</em> 3.382–384. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, it is Nestor making the promise of such a sacrifice, again to Athena. Nestor prays to Athena for good <em>kleos</em> for himself, his children, and his wife and promises her in return this same kind of unbroken one-year-old cow with gilded horns. The identical vow in both contexts suggests that an unbroken cow is especially appropriate for Athena, perhaps because of her own virgin status, and, of course, that the sacrifice is made in reciprocity for success. But also suggestive is the vow’s close association in both cases with Athena’s personal involvement with heroes, and specifically her accompaniment of them on a particular mission. Although it is not Telemakhos who makes the vow (the way Diomedes does here), Nestor mentions that she accompanies Telemakhos before he makes the vow in return for his own <em>kleos</em>. </p>

# Iliad 10.297

<p>ὥς τε λέοντε δύω</p><p>There are other examples in our Homeric texts of a pair of lions together. Only in the case of Hektor and Patroklos fighting do we find a simile of two lions fighting each other (<em>Iliad</em> 16.756–761). There are three examples, however, of lions hunting together as a team. At <em>Iliad</em> 5.539–560, Aeneas kills two twin brothers, Orsilokhos and Krethon, who are compared to two lions that prey on cattle and sheep until they are finally killed by the weapons of men. At <em>Iliad</em> 13.170–202, Teucer kills the Trojan Imbrios, and Hektor in return kills Amphimakhos. Ajax beats Hektor back, and the Achaeans drag both corpses out of battle. The Aiante, when they carry the corpse of Imbrios off the battlefield, are compared to two lions snatching a goat from the guard dogs and carrying it high in their jaws into the brush. These lion similes belong to a tradition of similes about lions attacking herds of domesticated animals, whether cattle, sheep, or goats, which are often protected by dogs and men. There are also two lions depicted on the shield of Achilles that attack a bull, drag it off, and gorge themselves on its blood while keeping dogs at bay (<em>Iliad</em> 18.579–586). A pair of lions working together, therefore, seems to be a traditional image, and as we can see from the similes in <em>Iliad</em> 5 and 13, this image is associated with special pairs of fighters. See above on 10.243 for Diomedes and Odysseus as one of these special pairs, especially in ambush situations, and also on 10.53 and 10.228 for the Aiante, when that dual form means Ajax and Teucer, as it seems to in Iliad 13. For more on lion similes in Homeric epic, see Scott 1974, Moulton 1977, Schnapp-Gourbeillon 1981, Lonsdale 1990, and Muellner 1990.</p><p>Also noteworthy in this simile, in terms of composition, is the lack of clear division between the lions and the warriors—both can be imagined going through the night, slaughter, corpses, war gear, and black blood. That is, at the end of 10.297 it seems like we could be going into an extended simile, but once we reach 10.298, and especially the mention of the war gear, we must reconsider the boundary of the simile. The simile then seems to be of the sort that is the ultimate compression: simply “like two lions” (compare other compressed lion similes at <em>Iliad</em> 5.299, 11.129, 12.293, 15.592, 17.542, and 24.572 and at <em>Odyssey</em> 9.292 and 23.48). Leonard Muellner (1990) has compellingly argued that these shorter similes are indeed compressed versions of the longer, more detailed lion similes, rather than the longer being (newer) extensions of these shorter types. Therefore, even this short phrase would evoke the imagery of two lions working together, as we see in greater detail in other similes. For similes involving lions that attack at night, see 10.485–488. See Scott 1974:90 for the combination, as on this line, of the formula βῆ/βᾶν δ’/ῥ’ ἴμεν followed by a simile.  </p>

# Iliad 10.298

<p>ἀμ φόνον, ἀν νέκυας, διά τ᾽ ἔντεα καὶ μέλαν αἷμα</p><p>As we have already seen on 10.199, corpses and gore are a significant feature of the landscape on this night. The second half of this line (διά τ᾽ ἔντεα καὶ μέλαν αἷμα) appears again at 10.469 as Odysseus and Diomedes move toward the Thracians. The scholia cite this phrase in different ways, reflecting various practices of ancient textual criticism. Looking at just the scholia in the Townley manuscripts (in the edition of Maass), for example, we see that the phrase is cited as a parallel use of διά with an accusative, as on <em>Iliad</em> 15.1 and 22.190. In this way, 10.298 is treated no differently from any other line in showing “Homeric” usage. This same phrase, however, is objected to on <em>Iliad</em> 23.806, because it is “transferred from the Doloneia,” an argument that reflects the Alexandrian dislike of repeated phrases, even though we know they are a natural and necessary element of oral composition-in-performance (see also 10.51–52). </p>

# Iliad 10.299-300

<p>οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδὲ Τρῶας ἀγήνορας εἴασεν Ἕκτωρ / εὕδειν, ἀλλ᾽ ἄμυδις κικλῄσκετο πάντας ἀρίστους</p><p>At the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 10, where Agamemnon cannot sleep because of worry, he looks out at the Trojan encampment and wonders at both the sight of the many fires and the sounds of flutes and pipes and the clamor of men (see 10.11–13). From that description, we already know that the Trojans are not sleeping. But this passage can also be a compressed version of the theme of a leader who cannot sleep and so calls together a council to make a plan. We see such a theme at the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 2, as well as in this book (see comments at 10.1ff.). In the process of oral composition-in-performance, the singer can compress or expand a theme, Lord’s term for “the groups of ideas regularly used in telling a tale in the formulaic style of traditional song” (Lord 1960/2000:68; for the singer’s ability to expand and compress themes, see Lord 1960/2000:78–80, 88–91). So here the singer, who has already sung a version of the theme for the scene at the Achaean camp, merely mentions sleeplessness and the calling together of the council without the development and expansion seen earlier. Even the enjambment of the verb εὕδειν on the second line of this compressed version is reminiscent of that at <em>Iliad</em> 2.2 and 10.2, indicating a compositional pattern.  </p>

# Iliad 10.300-301

<p>The identity of the ἄριστοι (10.300) whom Hektor calls together is explained by the following line: the leaders and rulers of the Trojans. On both sides, the leaders are regularly called the ἄριστοι (compare the same sense of the word on 10.1, 10.117, 10.214, and 10.273, as well as below on 10.326). Within this group, however, there is a competition to be the best of all, and participation in these dangerous nighttime missions is part of that competition: see above on 10.236 for this heightened sense of the word ἄριστος and the role that the best men play in ambush. </p>

This same phrase is used at <em>Iliad</em> 2.55, another episode that begins at night, when the Achaeans are similarly debating the very thing that Hektor wants to find out on this night: whether they should continue fighting or return home. There, the plan they decide upon also involves deception. In other contexts, too, the verb ἀρτύνω is used to set an ambush (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.469) or to devise false stories (<em>Odyssey</em> 11.366), so it, too, has thematic associations with cunning, deception, and ambush. Thus the whole phrase thematically encompasses the kind of plan that Hektor here proposes.  </p>

# Iliad 10.304

<p>μισθός </p><p>Disapproving interpretations of this term have added to the negative reception of the character of Dolon, from the scholia in the Venetus B and Townley manuscripts through to negative assumptions made in passing in more recent studies such as Schnapp-Goubeillon 1982:58, Holoka 1983:8, and Coffee 2009:62. (Hektor is criticized as well for offering a reward that he does not himself have, at that point, to give.) In Homeric diction, the term is used as remuneration for work, such as woodworking (<em>Iliad</em> 12.435) or shepherding (<em>Odyssey</em> 10.84), and can be used within a taunt (Odyssey 18.358, although so can ‘guest-gift’ [see Odyssey 9.370]). But <em>misthos</em> is also used for what Poseidon and Apollo expect in return for building the walls of Troy (<em>Iliad</em> 21.445, 21.450, 21.451, 21.457), so the labor itself need not be common. μισθός is also connected with another ambush episode: Menelaos says that the “pay” for the men who watched for Agamemnon’s return on Aegisthus’ behalf was two talents of gold (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.524–526). There, the task has a negative sense to it, but does the fact that pay is involved make this so? Focusing exclusively on the word <em>misthos</em> here ignores both that the reward is called a δῶρον in this same line (similar to Nestor calling his offer a δόσις, see 10.213) and that the spy will get κῦδος (10.307) for this mission as well. There may indeed be an implicit contrast in the poetry between the rewards offered on each side on this night, but condemnation of Dolon based on a notion of “work-for-pay” is too extreme, nor does it seem evident that <em>misthos</em> is indicative of the “unheroic” character of Dolon or of the Doloneia as a whole. </p>

# Iliad 10.305-306

<p>The recorded textual multiforms for 10.306 provide a good example of how oral composition operates within its tradition. In 10.305, Hektor offers as the great gift a chariot and two horses, and in the reading of the main text of the Venetus A, in 10.306, he further qualifies that he will give whichever horses are best at the swift ships of the Achaeans (οἵ κεν ἀριστεύωσι θοῇς ἐπὶ νηυσίν Ἀχαιῶν). The scholia in the A manuscript record three different readings by the three major Alexandrian Homeric scholars, which in turn all differ from this main text. First, it says that Aristarchus read οἵ κεν ἄριστοι ἔωσι θοῇς ἐπὶ νηυσίν Ἀχαιῶν. The meanings of that version and that of the main text of A are similar: Hektor indicates that the gift will be the best of the Achaean horses, but he does not make it any more specific. The difference between ἀριστεύωσι and ἄριστοι ἔωσι may be a performance variation, or it might have been introduced at some point in the textual tradition. Both Zenodotus and Aristophanes, however, knew versions of a line that did specify which horses: those of Achilles. Zenodotus read αὐτοὺς οἳ φορέουσι ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα (“the ones which carry the faultless son of Peleus”), similar to line 10.323 below. Aristophanes read something slightly different: καλοὺς οἳ φορέουσι ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα (“the fine ones which carry the faultless son of Peleus”).</p><p>In these four readings, then, we see how from performance to performance certain words or phrases might be used in place of one another, ἀριστεύωσι or ἄριστοι ἔωσι, αὐτοὺς or καλοὺς. But the choice between simply stating “whichever are best” and specifying the horses of Achilles reveals a deeper layer. In either case, Dolon would likely name the horses of Achilles in his reply, as he does in our version (see 10.323), so it is not a question of someone else’s horses being offered as a prize that is at issue here. Instead, if the singer sings “whichever are best at the ships of the Achaeans,” a traditional audience will immediately think of Achilles’ horses, knowing that they are indeed the best. We know this, too, because at the end of the catalog of ships, the narrator asks the Muse who was the best of the men, and who the best of the horses (<em>Iliad</em> 2.761–762). Eumelos’ mares are at first mentioned as the best horses (<em>Iliad</em> 2.763–765) and Ajax, son of Telamon, as the best man, but then both are qualified by the statement that this was true only so long as Achilles stayed angry, since both he and his horses were by far the best (<em>Iliad</em> 2.768–770; there, too, we have a similar phrase to describe the horses: ἵπποι θ’ οἳ φορέεσκον ἀμύμονα Πηλείωνα). So the singer may be implicit or explicit about which horses Hektor is offering, and these textual variations record different possibilities for how the line was performed. As we will see in further detail below (see 10.332), in both the Iliadic tradition and in other versions of this story, Hektor has his own designs on capturing the horses of Achilles (for example, he pursues them after the death of Patroklos, who drove them into battle, see <em>Iliad</em> 17.483–496), and the performance variation of whether Hektor is explicit or not in naming Achilles’ horses as the reward may be related to whether the singer has in mind that aspect of the tradition. In any case, these variations recorded in the scholia of the Venetus A reveal the multiplicity of the compositional possibilities here.</p>

# Iliad 10.305

<p>ἐριαύχενας ἵππους</p><p>Parry notes that ἐρι- is the Aeolic prefix. The Ionic form, ἀρι-, has the same metrical value, and so we would expect such words to shift to the Ionic. But, Parry argues, exceptions to that general rule of the evolution of Homeric language, such as we have in this case, show that “not only the bards’ habit of using epithets with the Aeolic prefix, but also their sense of the formula which contained such epithets, protected the prefix here from their tendency to keep only those elements of the λέξις ξενική which differed metrically from the corresponding Ionic forms.” Parry also notes that ἐριαύχενας appears only within this formula (Parry, MHV 181n1). From this we can see how conservative the oral composition process can be, in addition to how formulaic phrases can be thought of, used, and preserved by the singers as a unit.   </p>

As we argued above, these are clear indications that success on an ambush was considered prestigious for Homeric warriors.</p>

At 10.218, the same verse is used for the Achaean reaction to Nestor’s proposal for a spying mission. In general the formula is used after a challenge by one man to a group, whether his own comrades or the enemy, and this verse serves as a pause before another individual responds in one way or another to the challenge.

<p>These four lines provide us a brief introduction to Dolon. We are given his father’s name (314), and we learn that his father was a herald (315) and that Dolon was his only son, but that he had five sisters (317). Dolon is also described as wealthy (315), not good looking, and swift (316). We discuss in detail in the Dolon section of our essay “Tradition and Reception” how we understand Dolon’s traditional status. Here, we will look at each of these elements individually, each in its own context. To understand these characteristics properly, we must investigate what each attribute would mean to a traditional audience by examining evidence from the tradition itself, leaving aside any of our own cultural assumptions. </p>

# Iliad 10.314-315

<p>Εὐμήδεος υἱὸς / κήρυκος θείοιο</p><p>A patronymic is often read as a sign of traditionality: that is, a character with a patronymic has a lineage within traditional epic (for more about this initial line of introduction, see “Tradition and Reception” above). As we see here, and again when the patronymic is used on lines 412 and 426, it is also a useful formula for composition: combined with Dolon’s name, it fills the line from the weak caesura to the end of the line, one of the most common metrical patterns for name-epithet formulas. The enjambment of his father’s occupation on the next line is compositionally noteworthy: it is not necessary to complete the thought of the previous line (indeed, none of these details are strictly necessary—line 318 could follow 314 with no loss of sense). As Lord reminds us, “This absence of necessary enjambment is a characteristic of oral composition and is one of the easiest touchstones to apply in testing the orality of a poem. Milman Parry called it an ‘adding style’; the term is apt” (Lord 1960/2000:54). Eumedes’ role as herald must strongly suggest itself to the singer when his name is used in the patronymic formula. Scholiasts offer the possibility that Odysseus and Diomedes would perhaps know Dolon because he accompanied his father on official dispatches to the Greek camp (see below on 10.447). But there may also be implicit contrasts here: his father the herald visits the Achaean camp in an official capacity during the <em>daylight</em>. We can compare <em>Iliad</em> 7.370–415, when the Trojans decide <em>at dinner time</em> to send Idaios to the Achaeans <em>at dawn</em> the next day (see <em>Iliad</em> 7.370–372, 380–381). That is, it is made explicit that the herald will wait for daylight to go to the opposing camp, rather than immediately going in the dark. Dolon, as a spy at night, is a different kind of unofficial “visitor” to the enemy camp. Heralds are divinely protected in their duties, as the epithet θεῖος indicates, but spies are not, and Dolon cannot expect protection, or even mercy, when he encounters the Achaeans on his mission.  </p>

# Iliad 10.315

<p>πολύχρυσος πολύχαλκος</p><p>Dolon is also described as wealthy: “rich in gold, rich in bronze.” These epithets are more commonly used of places in our texts, and Dolon is the only person to be called by them. Mycenae is called πολύχρυσος three times (<em>Iliad</em> 7.180, 11.46, <em>Odyssey</em> 3.305). Sidon is called πολύχαλκος (<em>Odyssey</em> 15.425), as is the <em>ouranos</em> (<em>Iliad</em> 5.504; <em>Odyssey</em> 3.2), perhaps because of an association between the sky and the homes of the gods, which have bronze floors (<em>Iliad</em> 1.426, 14.173, 21.438, 21.505, <em>Odyssey</em> 8.321). The combination of both adjectives πολύχρυσος and πολύχαλκος is used only of Troy in our texts (<em>Iliad</em> 18.289), when Hektor says that formerly all mortals used to speak of Priam’s city as rich in gold, rich in bronze, but now the Trojans have had to sacrifice most of that wealth (<em>Iliad</em> 18.285–292). So the question emerges whether the combination of these adjectives evokes an association between Dolon and Priam’s Troy and its eventual doom, despite its wealth. Such an association may be too far-reaching, since in our texts Troy is described with these adjectives only once, although it is a very wealthy city according to tradition. Certainly Dolon’s wealth comes into play after his capture: when he promises Diomedes and Odysseus a great ransom (10.378–381) the traditional characteristic of his wealth indicates that he could indeed pay handsomely in exchange for his life.  </p>

# Iliad 10.316

<p>ὃς δή τοι εἶδος μὲν ἔην κακός, ἀλλὰ ποδώκης</p><p>These two characteristics are contrasted, one negative (ugly) and one positive (swift-footed). The phrase εἶδος … κακός is analogous to the more frequently used constructions for being good-looking, such as εἶδος ἄριστος / -η (<em>Iliad</em> 2.715, 3.39 = 13.769, 3.124, 13.365, 13.378, 17.142, <em>Odyssey</em> 11.469 = 24.17) and εἶδος ἀγητός / -όν / οί (<em>Iliad</em> 5.787 = 8.228, 22.370, 24.376, <em>Odyssey</em> 14.177). Compositionally, it is most like <em>Odyssey</em> 11.469 (= 24.17), which is also a relative clause with ἔην between the noun and adjective.</p><p>When we think of Homeric heroes who are explicitly labeled ugly, the first to come to mind is Thersites, who is described as “the ugliest man who came to Troy” (αἴσχιστος δὲ ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἦλθε, <em>Iliad</em> 2.216). We know that αἴσχιστος refers to his looks in particular because the next three lines expand on this adjective with details of his physical appearance: he is bandy-legged and lame in one foot, his shoulders hunch over his chest, and his head is pointy, with sparse hair on top (<em>Iliad</em> 2.217–219). He is especially hateful to Achilles and Odysseus, two preeminent heroes of the epic tradition (<em>Iliad</em> 2.220). Of course, Odysseus has a bitter encounter with Thersites in <em>Iliad</em> 2, and we know from Proklos’ summary of the <em>Aithiopis</em> that Achilles will eventually kill him in anger. Indeed, although we are told by the narrator that Thersites is a source of laughter (γελοίϊον, <em>Iliad</em> 2.215), and in his lameness he might be thought similar to Hephaistos, whose bustling provokes laughter (<em>Iliad</em> 1.599–600), Thersites provokes anger from the Achaeans (see Kouklanakis 1999). Dolon’s ugliness, by comparison, is not dwelled upon, and does not seem to provoke any particular strong reaction, whether ridicule, repulsion, or irritation (see, however, 10.400 for Odysseus’ smile and 10.446 for Diomedes’ glare as their reactions to Dolon upon his capture). Yet pairing Thersites and Dolon based on their looks might also suggest that, in the <em>Iliad</em>, Odysseus, whose own appearance is not unequivocally impressive (<em>Iliad</em> 3.209–224), seems to have the role of confronting ugly men (but in neither case is he their killer).</p><p>In contrast to his bad looks, Dolon does have the positive attribute of being swift-footed (ποδώκης). For a traditional audience, as well as for us, the epithet “swift-footed” brings to mind Achilles, of course. Achilles has two other “distinctive” (in Parry’s terms) epithets that indicate his swiftness, ποδάρκης and πόδας ὠκύς (Parry, MHV 64, 145), but he is also called “swift-footed” with the adjective ποδώκης twenty-two times in the <em>Iliad</em> and twice in the <em>Odyssey</em>. In addition to Achilles and Dolon, the adjective is also used for horses four times (in one of these cases, it is applied to the horses’ drivers in an apparent transference of the epithet). So, here, the epithet evokes both Achilles and horses just before Dolon asks for Achilles’ horses as his reward for undertaking the spying mission (10.322–323). Achilles, we know, is the best looking of the Achaeans, as well as the best overall (his horses are the best as well, see <em>Iliad</em> 2.769–770), and the trait of swiftness that Dolon shares with him heightens the contrast of Dolon’s ugliness. As we will see below (10.330), there seems to be a prohibition on the taking of Achilles’ horses by his enemies within the Iliadic tradition, and Odysseus’ reaction to Dolon’s confession that he has been promised them also points to this contrast: Dolon is like Achilles in being fast, but he is no Achilles. Like Dolon, however, Achilles is also involved in ambushes at night (see e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 21.34–39 and “The Poetics of Ambush”). Achilles’ swiftness has been understood as an important quality in battle, and it may also be so for ambush missions. If this is the case, Dolon’s swiftness will likewise be important for the spying mission he volunteers to undertake. We will see Dolon run, but he is outsmarted and overtaken by Odysseus and Diomedes. In one of his Cretan lies, Odysseus claims to have ambushed and killed Orsilokhos, a son of Idomeneus, in Crete, and he says that Orsilokhos is swift-footed, faster than all other seafaring men in wide Crete (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.259–270). That story provides another example of the victim of an ambusher being swift. It may be that the strategy involved in ambush is traditionally associated with overcoming physical talents, such as being a fast runner.  </p>

# Iliad 10.317

<p>αὐτὰρ ὃ μοῦνος ἔην μετὰ πέντε κασιγνήτῃσιν</p><p>Dolon’s status as an only son may be a detail that increases the audience’s sympathy for his death. Although some modern scholars revile Dolon completely (on this line, see e.g. Holoka 1983:8–9 and Hainsworth 1993, who calls Dolon a “sissy”), an ancient audience might have reacted quite differently. For example, we might compare Ilioneus the son of Phorbas: he is a Trojan identified as an only son, and his brief life story, given at the moment of his death, seems intended to arouse sympathy based on that status (<em>Iliad</em> 14.489–492). Both Achilles and Odysseus are only sons (as is Odysseus’ son Telemakhos, in the Odyssean tradition), and the epics offer intensely emotional scenes about the potential loss of the son. In <em>Iliad</em> 24.485–512, Priam appeals to Achilles to think of his father and how much he hopes to see his son return home, and Achilles weeps remembering both Patroklos and his father. In <em>Odyssey</em> 24.345–348, Laertes indeed sees his only son return home after twenty years and faints. We see the hope of and joy at the son’s return also embodied in a simile comparing Eumaios’ joy at greeting Telemakhos to a father greeting his only son (μοῦνος at <em>Odyssey</em> 16.19, just as here) coming home from a foreign land in the tenth year, having suffered greatly (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.17–19). Following this self-referential Odyssean simile, Eumaios kisses Telemakhos as though Telemakhos has escaped death. In fact, Telemakhos has just outsmarted the suitors in their ambush attempt, and so has escaped death (see also <em>Odyssey</em> 17.47, where Telemakhos says he has just escaped sheer destruction). Dolon will not return after he is ambushed, so his status as an only son should engender some sympathy for his father. Hainsworth (1993 <em>ad loc.</em>) objects to any notion of sympathy because Dolon’s status as an only son is mentioned here, but not at his death. At the moment of his departure, however, we already know that Dolon will die (10.336–337), so any sympathy evoked here is not that far from the indication of his death.</p><p>The detail of Dolon’s five sisters might add to the pathos in a different way, for brothers are possible avengers, and Dolon has none. (As an example of a brother as an avenger, compare <em>Iliad</em> 14.478–485, where Akamas stands over his fallen brother, claiming a <em>poinē</em> for him and saying that a man prays to leave someone behind him in his home to avenge his death in battle.) The death of a brother often causes anger and desire for revenge (e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 9.567, 11.248–258, 16.320) or is offered as a standard measure of a great loss (e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 9.632–636, 24.46–49). Once Dolon is dead, his sisters have a potential future fate as captive women: both Andromache and Briseis mention the loss of their brothers in war as a factor in their dire straits (<em>Iliad</em> 6.421–424 for Andromache; <em>Iliad</em> 19.293–294 for Briseis). Both of these factors, then, can be seen within the Homeric tradition to potentially evoke sympathy for Dolon’s death.</p><p>Throughout the <em>Iliad</em> passages that introduce warriors just before they die and provide details of their biographies would likely have served a commemorative function, and, compressed though they are, often share themes and imagery with traditional female laments, such as those sung by Andromache, Briseis, and Achilles’ mother Thetis in the <em>Iliad</em>. Many of these passages seem to be focalized through the eyes of a mother or widow. There are several examples of this phenomenon. In <em>Iliad</em> 11.221–228, we hear the story of Iphidamas, who leaves behind his bride to “go after the kleos of the Achaeans.” In <em>Iliad</em> 4.473–489, we learn how Simoeisios comes to be named by his parents, and that he dies before he can repay their care in raising him. He is compared to a felled poplar, a use of plant imagery that is also common in lament. The death of Gorgythion at <em>Iliad</em> 8.302–308 is a particularly beautiful example of this kind of passage, for which we use the evocative translation of Samuel Butler:</p><p>ὃ δ’ ἀμύμονα Γοργυθίωνα</p><p>υἱὸν ἐῢν Πριάμοιο κατὰ στῆθος βάλεν ἰῷ,</p><p>τόν ῥ’ ἐξ Αἰσύμηθεν ὀπυιομένη τέκε μήτηρ</p><p>καλὴ Καστιάνειρα δέμας ἐϊκυῖα θεῇσι.</p><p>μήκων δ’ ὡς ἑτέρωσε κάρη βάλεν, ἥ τ’ ἐνὶ κήπῳ</p><p>καρπῷ βριθομένη νοτίῃσί τε εἰαρινῇσιν,</p><p>ὣς ἑτέρωσ’ ἤμυσε κάρη πήληκι βαρυνθέν.</p><p>The arrow hit Priam’s brave son faultless Gorgythion in the chest. His mother, fair Kastianeira, lovely as a goddess, bore him after she had been married from Aisyme, and now he bowed his head as a garden poppy in full bloom when it is weighed down by showers in spring—even thus heavy bowed his head beneath the weight of his helmet.</p><p>Translation based on that of Samuel Butler</p><p>We can easily imagine these words spoken in the first person by Kastianeira upon learning of the death of her son in battle. Indeed, epic poetry is infused with the imagery, themes, and language of lament, so much so that a number of scholars have speculated that women’s lament traditions played a crucial role in the development of epic. Epic poetry narrates the glory of heroes, the <em>klea andrōn</em>, but it also laments their untimely deaths and the suffering they cause. That these lament-filled passages are more often than not sung for the death of the Trojans and their allies, and in this case the spy Dolon, is a testament to the remarkable parity of compassion that underlies the <em>Iliad</em>. Both sides are mourned equally. On the relationship between lament and epic, women’s songs and men’s songs, see Murnaghan 1999, Nagy 1999, Sultan 1999, and Dué 2002 and 2006a. On the mortality of the hero as a central theme of epic, see also Schein 1984, Greene 1999, and above on 10.259. On passages that lament the death of heroes in a highly compressed form, such as the one quoted from <em>Iliad</em> 8 here, see also Tsagalis 2004:179–187. Tsagalis argues that lament is “the form of speech that best represents the poem’s perspective” (167). If he is right then it is illuminating to consider that Dolon may once have been understood to be as deserving of sympathy and lamentation as any of the warriors who fall in battle in the <em>Iliad</em>.    </p>

# Iliad 10.325-327

<p>As we know from 10.56, 10.126–127, 10.180, and 10.198–199, the council first gathers at the watch station and then crosses the ditch to hold their deliberations. Dolon’s supposition of where to find them, then, is wrong, but not entirely misguided. Earlier that morning, the Trojan herald Idaios found the Achaeans assembled near the stern of Agamemnon’s ship (<em>Iliad</em> 7.382–383). Earlier on this night Agamemnon held a council of the leaders in his shelter (<em>Iliad</em> 9.89–90), and it was there that the embassy returned to deliver their news (<em>Iliad</em> 9.669). Another council had been held at night at Nestor’s ship (<em>Iliad</em> 2.53–54). That such councils are usually held at the ships gives even greater meaning to the choice of a meeting place across the ditch (see on 10.194 and 10.199).</p><p>Another question that scholars have raised about his supposition, however, is whether Dolon is ignorant of the ditch and wall, since he does not mention them. In discussing another so-called problem connected to the wall—namely, whether or not it is present in <em>Iliad</em> 10, and if it is, how Agamemnon can see over it to the Trojan camp at the beginning of the Book—Shewan (1911:181) argues against such prosaic demands of the poetry. Fenik (1964:60) argues that presuming some version of the Doloneia in which there is no wall goes too far, and he notes that, in the <em>Rhesos</em> (213), Dolon is aware of the ditch and the wall but intends to be able to spy anyway. So when Dolon says that he will go through the Achaean encampment all the way to Agamemnon’s ship, we can easily understand that he is including making his way across the ditch and wall. But, of course, he will never make it that far. Exactly how he will get over them becomes a moot point, especially given that this is a traditional story in which his fortunes are not only known but are even foretold as he leaves (see below on 10.336–337).</p>

# Iliad 10.329

<p>Ζεὺς αὐτὸς ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης  </p><p>At 10.5 Zeus is named only as “the husband of Hera with her beautiful hair” (πόσις Ἥρης ἠϋκόμοιο); here, his name is combined with the epithet phrase “the loud-sounding husband of Hera.” These two epithets reveal more about how oral traditional language operates within composition-in-performance. Zeus is called the husband of Hera with these two formulas, and Alexander is called “radiant Alexander, the husband of Helen, with her beautiful hair” (δῖος Ἀλέξανδρος Ἑλένης πόσις ἠϋκόμοιο, <em>Iliad</em> 3.329 = 7.355 = 8.82; see also <em>Iliad</em> 11.369 and 11.505, where δῖος is replaced by αὐτάρ and εἰ μή, respectively). In Homeric diction the word πόσις is used in other cases, such as that of Hektor as the husband of Andromache (<em>Iliad</em> 6.484, 8.190, 22.439) and of Odysseus as the husband of Penelope in the Odyssey (18.253, 19.126, 19.549), when the wife of a man is part of his epic identity and so is used in naming him within the tradition. In the case of Paris and Zeus, then, that key relationship has been fashioned into traditional epithets. Their epithets that include the adjective ἠϋκόμοιο have likely been formed by analogy. Parry notes that the formula found on this line is especially associated with prayer, whether expressing a wish or calling Zeus to witness oaths (MHV 181–182; for an oath, compare <em>Iliad</em> 7.411). See above on 10.305 for the prefix ἐρι-.</p><p>  </p>

<p>ἐποχήσεται  </p><p>This verb is likewise used (in its only other appearance in our texts) at <em>Iliad</em> 17.449, when Zeus will not allow Hektor to take Achilles’ horses after he kills Patroklos, whom the horses mourn nearby. A telling cross-reference can be made, then, with this resonant verb: Hektor promises to Dolon that no one else will take Achilles’ horses, and in Book 17 it is Hektor himself who is prohibited from doing so by Zeus. Within the larger tradition, this verb may be part of a traditional vocabulary about Achilles’ horses and may therefore evoke for a traditional audience the embedded knowledge that Achilles will never lose his horses to his enemies. (See also below at 10.402–404.) At <em>Iliad</em> 17.75–78, Apollo actively dissuades Hektor from going after the horses. Disguised as Mentes, Apollo tells Hektor that he runs in pursuit of something unattainable (Ἕκτορ νῦν σὺ μὲν ὧδε θέεις ἀκίχητα διώκων). In both of these cases, it is a god who forbids the theft from happening, and Zeus recalls there how it was the gods who gave the horses to Peleus. That the horses were originally a wedding gift to Peleus from the gods may account for why Achilles’ horses are not subject to the same vagaries of warfare as, say, Rhesos’ horses are. Deep familiarity with this vocabulary would also shape the audience’s reception of the request by Dolon and promise by Hektor.</p>

# Iliad 10.331

<p>ἀγλαϊεῖσθαι is a <em>hapax legomenon</em>: that is, this verb appears only here in our texts. Some critics who have argued that <em>Iliad</em> 10 is later and/or separate from the rest of the <em>Iliad</em> use the number of <em>hapax legomena</em> in this book as evidence of different composition and/or authorship. Yet an understanding of oral poetics and the techniques of oral composition-in-performance can account for such seeming anomalies in a different way. When we look at the entire “database” that the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> provide, we find, not this verb, of course, but the adjective ἀγλαός used in many contexts in which the heroes receive material goods as a result of their actions. Most often the phrase is ἀγλαὰ δῶρα (used twenty-one times in our texts). These gifts “shine” not just physically (as they do if they happen to be made of precious metal), but metonymically as the physical manifestation of the radiant glory the hero either has won or stands to win. (See on 10.212–213 above for the connection between gifts and glory in this epic tradition.) We also see phrases like ἀγλά’ ἄποινα (<em>Iliad</em> 1.23 = 1.377, <em>Iliad</em> 1.111), ἀγλά’ ἄεθλα (<em>Iliad</em> 23.262), and even ἀγλαὸν εὖχος (<em>Iliad</em> 7.203) in contexts in which the hero has something to gain through his victory. These phrases may have been created by analogy with the phrase ἀγλαὰ δῶρα, especially because the idea of victory bringing both gifts and glory was so fundamental (see Parry MHV 68–76 for the principle of analogy in the composition of oral poetry). So if a singer has learned the idea encapsulated in the adjective, it would be natural to create a phrase using the verb instead. As Albert Lord has argued, the language of oral poetry operates just like spoken language, and learning and using the language of the poetry is no more mechanical and no less fluid than learning and using a spoken language (Lord 1960/2000:35–37). And in fact, a related, compound verb form, ἐπαγλαίεσθαι, is used to describe Hektor exulting in Achilles’ armor, which he puts on after he strips it from Patroklos’ corpse (<em>Iliad</em> 18.133). So even if from our perspective it may seem that this verb is unusual within the texts we have, we cannot say that all those uses of the adjective were sung and resung before any singer thought to use the verb in the same kind of context. The fact that ἀγλαϊεῖσθαι is a <em>hapax</em> does not prove that it is untraditional. In fact, in making such determinations, we need to examine whether the idea, and not just the morphology, of the word or phrase is traditional if we are to understand it properly within the system of the poetic language.</p>

# Iliad 10.332

<p>ὣς φάτο καί ῥ᾽ ἐπίορκον ἐπώμοσε</p><p>In the other instances of ἐπίορκον and related words in the <em>Iliad</em> it means a ‘false oath’: that is, one swears an oath and then violates it, or one is lying when he swears about some action in the past. At <em>Iliad</em> 3.276–280, Agamemnon calls on Zeus, Helios, the Earth, the rivers, and those in the underworld who punish swearers of false oaths (ἐπίορκον, <em>Iliad</em> 3.279) to guard the sanctity of the oaths that the Achaeans and Trojans are about to take in advance of the duel between Menelaos and Paris. In <em>Iliad</em> 19.187–188, Agamemnon responds to Odysseus’ request that he swear to Achilles that he never slept with Briseis by saying that he is willing to swear to it and that he is not falsely swearing (οὐδ’ ἐπιορκήσω). When Briseis is then brought back to Achilles, Agamemnon does indeed take an oath to that effect, beginning it in much the same way as in <em>Iliad</em> 3 (<em>Iliad</em> 19.260 ≈ <em>Iliad</em> 3.279), but adding the stipulation that, if he is swearing falsely (ἐπίορκον,  <em>Iliad</em> 19.264), he wishes that the gods may give him the many sufferings that they give to those who transgress their oaths. These contexts leave little doubt that the false oath is either intentionally broken or is an intentional lie.</p><p>Yet in this case readers, translators, and critics over the ages have been reluctant to think of Hektor as intentionally lying. Over a dozen manuscripts have ἐπεὶ ὅρκον, and some of these have it as a “correction,” indicating perhaps a felt need to remove the characterization of Hektor’s words as an intentionally false oath. The main scholia in the Venetus A similarly suggest that Hektor is not purposefully swearing a false oath, but that it is false because what he swears will happen is not fulfilled (οὐχ οἷον ἑκουσίως, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ ἀποτελεσθῆναι τοῦτο, ὅπερ ὤμοσεν). Cunliffe (1963) likewise makes an exception of this use in his lexicon, saying its use is “here of unintentional falsity, the fulfilment of the oath turning out to be impossible.” As we have just seen on 10.300, fulfillment of the oath is indeed impossible, and because there is no sense that Hektor should be punished (an idea that does appear in the other contexts), perhaps we should interpret Hektor’s oath as unintentionally false. In <em>Iliad</em> 17, Hektor goes after the horses himself, suggesting that he does not know that they cannot be captured by an enemy of Achilles.</p><p>But there are other possibilities for interpretation by a traditional audience. The Trojans are portrayed as oath breakers, as when Pandaros breaks the ceasefire in <em>Iliad</em> 4 (Idomeneus explicitly says the Trojans have broken their oaths at <em>Iliad</em> 4.269–270). Even for the duel between Paris and Menelaos itself, Agamemnon requires Priam to come to the battlefield to swear the oath because he does not trust his sons (<em>Iliad</em> 3.105–106). The earlier Trojan king Laomedon reneged on his deals both with Apollo and Poseidon for building the walls of Troy (see <em>Iliad</em> 21.439–460) and with Herakles, to whom he had promised to give his horses upon the rescue of his daughter Hesione (an episode alluded to at <em>Iliad</em> 5.640). So a traditional audience might have understood Hektor’s promise within the general traditional framework of Trojan promises in return for work or missions that are subsequently broken. Another possibility is offered in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>, where Hektor makes plain that he has designs on getting Achilles’ horses for himself, recounting their immortal origins (<em>Rhesos</em> 184–188). When he acquiesces to Dolon’s request, he explicitly says that he will not be false (ἀλλ’ οὔ σ’ ἐπάρας ψεύσομαι, <em>Rhesos</em> 189). The <em>Rhesos</em> employs different, yet traditional, narrative possibilities for the story (Fenik 1964), and the possibility that Hektor really plans to get Achilles’ horses for himself may underlie the mention of a false oath here in a compression of details that would have meaning nevertheless for a traditional audience.  </p>

<p>These lines function as an arming scene, as 10.254–272 did for Diomedes and Odysseus. Lord (1960/2000:89–91) uses arming scenes from <em>Iliad</em> 3.328–338, 11.15–55, 16.130–154, and 19.369–391 as examples of a traditional theme in Greek oral epic, and demonstrates that this theme can be expanded or compressed as the singer sees fit. Lord notes that, in <em>Iliad</em> 3, the arming of Paris is given in some detail, while the parallel arming of Menelaos is compressed into a single line. (That compression is what we find in the manuscripts that survive, but we should note that there is an expanded description in a third-century BCE papyrus—Allen’s papyrus 40, Hibeh 19—of the arming of Menelaos, comprising four lines, all in traditional language, but the individual pieces of armor are put on in a different order from what we find in the other surviving arming scenes.) When we compare the earlier arming scene with this one, we also see that the arming scene of Diomedes and Odysseus is described at greater length than that of Dolon here. In addition to that more expanded arming scene, the details of Dolon’s equipment are also reminiscent of the night dressing scenes earlier in the episode (see 10.21–24, 10.29–31, and 10.177–178), since Dolon puts on his animal skin now to leave for his mission, while Agamemnon, Menelaos, and Diomedes had put on theirs when rising from bed. It does not seem that Diomedes wears his lion skin while on the mission, although he is twice compared to a lion (10.297 and 10.485). The cap Dolon wears is similar to that worn by Diomedes in that it is made of animal skin (κυνέην), but instead of being made from a bull’s hide, it is made from a marten (κτιδέην). The details of his equipment will be revisited when Odysseus and Diomedes strip Dolon’s corpse (see 10.458–459).</p>

# Iliad 10.334

<p>ῥινὸν πολιοῖο λύκοιο </p><p>There is a substantial history of reading a ritual significance to Dolon’s wolf skin, starting with Gernet (1936). Gernet (1936:190–191) argues that the tragedy Rhesos is needed to understand the meaning of the wolf skin. In that tragedy, Dolon makes the wolf skin explicitly a disguise for the purpose of deception. He implies that he will look like a wolf and says that he will walk like a wolf, too, to confuse anyone who tracks him (<em>Rhesos</em> 208–215; see Plate 5 for a similar visual image). Being or playing a wolf, according to Gernet, can be interpreted as a kind of liminal stage of an initiation ritual (1936:193–196). He also considers the symbolism of the wolf as an “outlaw figure” (1936:200). Gernet’s ritual interpretation is followed, in later examinations of Dolon as a wolf, by Davidson 1979, Petegorsky 1982, and Wathelet 1989. See further on 10.465–466, where Odysseus hangs the wolf skin on the tamarisk bush.</p><p>Other arguments have proposed that the wolf skin marks Dolon as a type of figure usually featured in other kinds of narratives outside of epic. Davidson (1979:65) expands on the notion of the outlaw figure and argues that this story follows a mythical pattern in which Dolon is a trickster figure who is tricked upon, and she sees a connection between trickster imagery and lone wolf imagery. Malcolm Davies argues for a folktale background, proposing that Dolon is like the “ambivalent helper” figure in quest stories and that his wolf skin is suggestive of the metamorphosis or disguise such figures often take (Davies 2005:31–32).</p><p>Schnapp-Gourbeillon (1981:112–114) questions the interpretation of the wolf skin as initiatory, and she finds “serious difficulties” with Gernet’s approach, for using another source to understand Dolon’s wolf skin in the <em>Iliad</em>, singling out Dolon’s animal skin alone as ritually significant, and ignoring Athena’s possible ritual role. Instead, she argues that animal skins are worn for a particular type of nocturnal action, or by a specific type of persons, or both (Schnapp-Gourbeillon 1981:119–120). She argues that the symbolism of wearing the skins of particular animals is similar to what we see of the animal’s symbolism in the similes. Dolon is above all “like a wolf” in that he is a minor predator: when Dolon, the wolf, meets Diomedes, the lion, he never has a chance (1981:120). One further question regarding an initiatory significance, which arises from the differences between the ways in which the wolf skin is presented here and in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>, is that here, the wolf skin, although worn on the mission, is not presented as a disguise for Dolon. Rather, it is connected to the ambush theme like the earlier night dressing scenes, as we have explored above (see 10.21–24, 10.29–31, and 10.177–178). Wathelet notes with an eye to the practical that the gray color of the wolf skin provides a kind of camouflage in the night (1989:220). There may also be some harbinger of failure in that Dolon goes as a “lone wolf”: Homeric similes involving wolves always refer to them as plural, hunting in packs (see <em>Iliad</em> 4.471–472, 11.72–73, 13.101–106, 16.156–166, 16.352–356). </p>

<p>κρατὶ δ᾽ ἐπὶ κτιδέην κυνέην</p><p>Dolon’s helmet, like those worn by Diomedes and Odysseus on this night, is made of animal hide rather than metal, as is appropriate to maneuvers in the dark. It provides stealth, whereas metal can reflect whatever light is available and give an ambusher away. (See on 10.257 and our essay “The Poetics of Ambush” for a full discussion.) The animal from whose hide Dolon’s cap is made, the ἴκτις, is the marten, a member of the weasel family. It is tempting to make the connection that, by wearing this helmet, Dolon is being characterized as “weasely.” (About this animal but not this passage, Aristotle notes that the ἴκτις has the “wickedness of character like the weasel,” <em>History of Animals</em> 612b10.) Even with that ancient testimony, however, we need to be careful not to make assumptions about associations with this animal in Homeric epic. This helmet is the only mention of the marten in our Homeric texts, so we can only speculate about what the associations might have been. The significance may instead be that this omnivorous animal hunts at night (Schwanz 2000). Nicander’s <em>Theriaca</em> 196–197, from the second century BCE, describes the ἴκτις as an animal that kills domestic birds in their sleep, making it very much like an ambusher at night. Also, Wathelet argues that the marten, like other members of the weasel family, is perhaps known for spying (Wathelet 1989:220). If these are indeed the associations an ancient audience would make, then not only are the physical qualities of the hide appropriate to the night, but also the marten’s characteristics mark Dolon as a “creature of the night.”  </p>

# Iliad 10.336-337

<p>οὐδ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλεν / ἐλθὼν ἐκ νηῶν ἂψ Ἕκτορι μῦθον ἀποίσειν</p><p>Based on his experience with living singers composing in performance, Albert Lord notes that planning and a sense of the song as a whole is usual in oral poetry. Although there is pressure to compose rapidly, “In all these instances one sees also that the singer always has the end of the theme in his mind. He knows where he is going. As in the adding of one line to another, so in the adding of one element in a theme to another, the singer can stop and fondly dwell upon any single item without losing a sense of the whole. The style allows comfortably for digression or for enrichment. Once embarked upon a theme, the singer can proceed at his own pace” (Lord 1960/2000:92). The traditional nature of the story means that Dolon’s death is expected by the audience even as it is anticipated here. We also see this sort of planning in anticipation of a character’s impending death in daytime battle. We can compare, for just one example, the even longer-range planning evident in the death of Asios. Soon after Asios is introduced (<em>Iliad</em> 12.95–97) and begins his headstrong attack by chariot on the Achaean wall, the narrator similarly reports that Asios will not escape death or ever return to Troy because Idomeneus will kill him (<em>Iliad</em> 12.113–117; note the same introductory language, οὐδ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλε, <em>Iliad</em> 12.113). Idomeneus does indeed kill him, but not until <em>Iliad</em> 13.383–393. This type of planning is not literary, but rather based in tradition: both the singer and the audience know that Idomeneus will kill Asios, so announcing it early confirms that the traditional story will be followed. By understanding this oral traditional feature, we can assume that Dolon’s lack of return follows tradition as well.</p><p>Within the ambush theme, moreover, there is a particular emphasis on the need to return. A failure to return means not only that the mission is unsuccessful, but also that the family and comrades may not know what has happened to the spy or ambusher. We see this aspect of the theme in Nestor’s words about the need to come back safely (10.212) and Diomedes’ choice of Odysseus as his partner based on Odysseus’ ability to return home (10.246–247). But we also see it in compressed versions of the theme, such as Glaukos’ narration of the ambush of Bellerophon, in which the ambushers are said not to return home because Bellerophon killed them all (<em>Iliad</em> 6.189–190). In this case, just as Dolon begins his mission, we are alerted already that Dolon will not be successful. This anticipation of his failure and impending death adds to the pathos inherent in the description of his family (10.317). But it also adds to the success of the Achaeans on this night: they triumph in preventing Dolon from bringing information to Hektor as well as in killing Rhesos and his comrades and stealing the horses.  </p>

<p>One aspect of these night missions that informs the poetics of the ambush theme is the lack of sure visual knowledge in the dark. Odysseus can see someone, but cannot yet be sure who he is or why he is there. We have already seen manifestations of this aspect of ambush, such as when Nestor tells the man he cannot see well enough to recognize that he should speak out and not sneak up on him (10.82–85). Odysseus displays his talent for ambush by anticipating that this man may be the enemy and by employing a strategy that gives them the advantage.

In the Homeric epics we have another example of this strategy in one of Odysseus’ Cretan lies in <em>Odyssey</em> 13; Odysseus describes a similar position for the ambush he narrates there: ἐγγὺς ὁδοῖο λοχησάμενος (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.268). We also see such a place for an ambush in Pindar’s description of Herakles’ ambush of the Molione (<em>Olympian</em> 10.26–34, ἐφ’ ὁδῷ, 10.30). At this point we begin to see how easily a spying mission transitions into an ambush once the presence of the enemy is detected.  </p>

# Iliad 10.351-352

<p>ἀλλ’ ὅτε δή ῥ’ ἀπέην ὅσσόν τ’ ἐπί οὖρα πέλονται / ἡμιόνων</p><p>The distance of the mule’s plow range seems to take us out of the realm of war and into a farming setting, but when we look at other instances in Homeric epic of this description of distance, it takes us rather into the world of athletics. During the funeral games for Patroklos, this same word οὖρα is used for the distance of a discus throw of a young man, and it serves as a point of comparison for the distance during which Antilokhos’ horses were even with those of Menelaos (<em>Iliad</em> 23.431–433). And in the games on Phaeacia in the <em>Odyssey</em>, it is used to describe by how much Klytoneos won the footrace (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.123–125). Since we find many similarities of language between this section of <em>Iliad</em> 10 and <em>Iliad</em> 22 (see below on 10.363–368), we might also compare from that episode how Achilles’ chase of Hektor is compared to both a footrace and a chariot race at a hero’s funeral games, but with Hektor’s life as a prize (<em>Iliad</em> 22.157–166). Here, too, begins a “footrace” that will end in Dolon’s death.  </p>

# Iliad 10.352-353

<p>According to the Townley scholia, Aristarchus understood this elaboration on the length of the furrow as redefining the length meant here. It is not the length of a standard furrow, but rather the difference in distance between that which a team of mules would plough and that which a team of oxen would—according to Aristarchus, mules are faster (presumably that is how we should understand προφερέστεραι). The fact that no reference to oxen appears in the comparison to the mules’ furrow at <em>Odyssey</em> 8.123–125 may suggest that here it is indeed a difference in length. As we try to understand the comparison and envision what this distance represents, we should also consider the poetics of night missions: Odysseus’ strategy is to let Dolon pass them by so that they can run up behind him and prevent his escape, but they also cannot lose sight of him. That factor may speak in favor of the shorter distance that Aristarchus proposes. See also Scott 1974:20–24 on Homeric similes describing measurement in general. </p>

<p>Odysseus’ plan also works to their advantage in another way—because they are now behind Dolon, that is, because they are coming at him from the same direction he has just come, he assumes they must be Trojans. The fact that he stops momentarily allows them to catch the swift-footed Dolon. Another of the sensory aspects of the night that is part of these poetics is the primacy of the sense of hearing. Yet, what one hears requires correct interpretation. In the next two lines, Dolon will realize that he has fatally misinterpreted what he heard as his sight contradicts his supposition.</p>

<p>ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δή ῥ᾽ ἄπεσαν δουρηνεκὲς ἢ καὶ ἔλασσον</p><p>As at 10.351, here distance is expressed through comparison. Scott observes that in the Homeric epics, “Similes of distance are the most numerous type of approximate measure” (Scott 1974:21). Since Diomedes will indeed throw his spear at Dolon (10.372–374), this comparison also seems to anticipate how far they remain apart during the chase. The distance of a spear cast is used to picture other distances, such as the length of the pathway by which Apollo bridges the Achaean ditch (<em>Iliad</em> 15.358–360), the length of Achilles’ leap away from the river Xanthos as it pursues him (<em>Iliad</em> 21.251), and how far the Trojans give way to the Achaean charge (<em>Iliad</em> 16.589–592: there, the spear cast may be either in battle or in athletic games, compare 10.351–352 above).  </p>

# Iliad 10.360-363

<p>As Diomedes and Odysseus start to pursue Dolon, they are compared to hunting dogs chasing after prey. Scott (1974:72–73) has identified hunting as a traditional subject matter for Homeric similes. In several similes, dogs accompanying hunters may confront powerful animals such as lions or boars (e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 8.337–342, 11.292–295, 12.41–49). But other similes are closer to what we have here: dogs chasing after weaker, non-predatory animals such as fawns or hares. In two similes in the <em>Iliad</em> that have this structure, at <em>Iliad</em> 15.579–581 (Antilokhos pouncing on Melanippos) and <em>Iliad</em> 22.188–193 (Achilles pursuing Hektor), a fawn has been chased from its lair (ἐξ εὐνῆφι, <em>Iliad</em> 15.580; ἐξ εὐνῆς, <em>Iliad</em> 22.190). We have seen above (10.5–9) how the adjective pukinos connects the ideas of an animal’s lair and ambush, and εὐνή means a ‘lair’ for a fawn, but a ‘bed’ for humans, further connecting the idea to night and sleeping. The animal in this simile has not explicitly been chased from its lair, but the association may be a traditional one for this kind of hunting simile, and it reverses the position of the ambusher and the ambushed, just as Dolon’s position of spy has now been reversed to the one being spied.</p><p>We can also compare this simile to the one likening the watchmen to guard dogs at 10.180–189. Although both similes compare the men to dogs, we can see in the differences of detail how similes are attached to and elaborate themes in this oral tradition (see also 10.5–9 for our detailed discussion of Homeric similes). At 10.180–189 the theme is one of being on the defensive against a night attack. Here, the Achaeans are the ones on the attack, and so the simile shows dogs acting in a different manner. That dogs are featured as the vehicle in both instances shows the flexibility and multiformity of Homeric similes.</p>

# Iliad 10.361

<p>ἢ κεμάδ᾽ ἠὲ λαγωὸν</p><p>Providing alternative possibilities is a traditional feature of Homeric similes (Muellner 1990:62–64). κέμας is a <em>hapax legomenon</em>, but λαγωός appears in two other contexts, both related to this one in different ways. It appears in another simile, as Hektor swoops at Achilles like an eagle at a lamb or a hare (<em>Iliad</em> 22.308–310, note here also the alternatives for the prey). We can compare also the hunting dog simile at <em>Iliad</em> 22.188–193 as Achilles pursues Hektor. As we will see further at 10.363–368, this scene shares language in common with <em>Iliad</em> 22; so also in these two similes, the object of the chase or attack in both places can be a hare. The other place we see a similar alternation of the object of a hunting dog’s pursuit is in a description of an actual hunt rather than a simile: Odysseus’ dog Argos is described as having hunted wild goats and deer and hares (<em>Odyssey</em> 17.295) when he was younger.  </p>

# Iliad 10.363-368

<p>This “chase scene” has language in common with the scene in which Achilles chases the fleeing Hektor in <em>Iliad</em> 22. The same formula is used for the departure of the one who will be chased (λαιψηρὰ δὲ γούνατ’ ἐνώμα, <em>Iliad</em> 10.358 and 22.144). The move Odysseus and Diomedes employ here to isolate Dolon and cut him off from the warriors (λαοῦ ἀποτμήξαντε, 10.364) is like the move Andromache, who knows her military strategy, imagines that Achilles might use to cut Hektor off from the city and force him to the open plain (δείδω μὴ δή μοι θρασὺν Ἕκτορα δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς / μοῦνον ἀποτμήξας πόλιος πεδίον δὲ δίηται, <em>Iliad</em> 22.455–456). When Dolon is approaching the guards’ post, Athena puts <em>menos</em> into Diomedes so that he can capture Dolon before anyone else (10.365–368). Similarly, while Achilles is pursuing Hektor, he signals to the other Achaeans not to shoot at Hektor and win his radiant glory (<em>Iliad</em> 22.205–207). In both cases the formula ὃ δὲ δεύτερος ἔλθῃ / ἔλθοι is used (<em>Iliad</em> 10.368, 22.207). These similarities indicate two things about the language in this section of <em>Iliad</em> 10: one, that this scene is expressed with traditional language, and, two, that there is <em>kudos</em> ‘radiant glory’ for capturing or killing a spy, just as there is for being one (see above, 10.307). Using such language gives the competitiveness to be “first” in this case traditional associations with a hot, yet focused, pursuit of a significant individual enemy.</p>

<p>ὃ πτολίπορθος Ὀδυσσεὺς</p><p>This epithet, “sacker of cities,” is one that Odysseus often receives in the <em>Odyssey</em>, but he also shares it with other heroes, like Achilles, and war gods, such as Ares and Enyo, within the tradition. Parry has shown that such epithets belong to the whole tradition and not any one line (MHV 137–138, 146, 171): that is, Odysseus is a sacker of cities within the whole tradition, not simply, or in this line, not yet at this particular point in the story. Similarly, Haft (1990) argues that this epithet, used frequently in the <em>Odyssey</em>, but only here and at <em>Iliad</em> 2.278 in the <em>Iliad</em>, implies that the audience would be familiar with Odysseus’ later exploits, especially his role in sacking Troy through the ambush strategy of the Wooden Horse, and thus would understand the epithet to mean the sacker of Troy in particular. In this last detail, she disagrees with Parry, who labels this epithet generic (MHV 146). Haft argues that the use of the definite article with the epithet makes its meaning more specific (see also above on 10.231). Haft also draws parallels and connections between the ambushes in <em>Iliad</em> 10 and the sack of Troy (Haft 1990:51–55).   </p>

# Iliad 10.376

<p>χλωρὸς ὑπαὶ δείους</p><p>As a color for objects, χλωρός is somewhere on the yellow–green spectrum: in Homeric epic it is used to describe honey (<em>Iliad</em> 11.631; <em>Odyssey</em> 10.234) and also various kinds of plants or wood (<em>Odyssey</em> 9.320, 9.379, 16.47). But in these epics it is most often associated with fear, as it is here. This color describes fear (δέος) itself in several related formulas with the verb αἱρέω, all of which have as their basic meaning “green fear seized me/them/everyone” (see <em>Iliad</em> 7.479, 8.77, 17.67; Odyssey 11.43, 11.633, 12.243, 22.42, 24.450, 24.533). John Miles Foley (1999:216–217) identifies “green fear” as a traditional phrase, one which reveals “psychological states and tangible objects woven into the fabric of the narrative tradition that are singularly meaningful and recognizable to bard and audience alike.” He argues that a fear so described “is by traditional definition a superhuman, unconquerable force” (1999:217). According to Foley, then, this phrase is a single unit of utterance, with its own, irreducible meaning. At <em>Iliad</em> 15.4 we find a phrasing very similar to the one here, and it does show the supernatural element that Foley identifies: there Poseidon has turned the tide of the battle and the Trojans are pushed back across the Achaeans’ ditch. They are described as χλωροὶ ὑπαὶ δείους πεφοβημένοι (“green with fear after they were put to flight”). The ὑπαί in these phrases (ὑπό also shows up at <em>Iliad</em> 8.77 and <em>Odyssey</em> 22.42 = 24.450) perhaps conveys the idea of this green color rising up to the skin’s surface. In ambush situations in particular, the paleness or changing color of a man’s skin is considered revealing. Idomeneus mentions that ambush especially exposes who is a coward and who is a brave man. The coward is exposed by his skin changing colors from his fear, as well as by an inability to sit still and a pounding heart. By contrast, the brave man’s skin does not change color, and he does not feel too much fear (<em>Iliad</em> 13.276–286). Here, Dolon’s fear is explicit (10.374), and the chattering of his teeth and paleness are manifestations of it. The suitors are similarly described at the moment they realize that the stranger is Odysseus: τοὺς δ’ ἅρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλε (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.42). Thus, in two cases, at least, green fear is also associated with men who realize at that moment that they have been ambushed.  </p>

# Iliad 10.378-381

<p>This offer of ransom for being taken alive rather than killed is another example of both the traditional language of <em>Iliad</em> 10 and the Doloneia’s place within the Iliadic tradition. Donna Wilson has demonstrated that, although there are references to ransoming practices that occur before the direct action of the <em>Iliad</em>, within that direct action the taking of prisoners does not happen, and all appeals to ransom are rejected (2002:29–34). As she notes, “The <em>Iliad</em> develops the compensation theme temporally in such a way that all offers of <em>apoina</em> mentioned as taking place <em>before</em> Chryses’ offer in Book 1 or <em>after</em> Priam’s in Book 24 are successful or potentially successful. But all offers of <em>apoina</em> in the time <em>between</em> Chryses’ and Priam’s offers fail” (Wilson 2002:31, original emphasis). Thus the refusal to ransom Dolon (and killing him instead) fits into the overall treatment of this theme in the <em>Iliad</em>. See <em>Iliad</em> 21.34–44 for the example of Lykaon as a prisoner taken alive during a nighttime ambush (which temporally happens before Chryses’ offer).</p><p>The offer that Dolon makes uses the traditional, formulaic language of such offers of <em>apoina</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>. We see the same language of 10.379–381 used at <em>Iliad</em> 6.48–50, when Adrestos supplicates Menelaos to ransom him, and also at <em>Iliad</em> 11.133–135, when two brothers, Peisandros and Hippolokhos, supplicate Agamemnon (with the necessary changes of singular and dual/plural pronouns in each of the three situations). In all three cases, just as Wilson has observed, the plea is rejected and the supplicant is killed instead (Dol</p><p>on will attempt a supplicatory gesture just before he is killed, see 10.454–456).</p>

<p>ἀλλ’ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον</p><p>This same formula appears below at 10.405 and also at <em>Iliad</em> 24.380, when the disguised Hermes says it to Priam as he goes to the Achaean camp. See above on 10.1ff. for the ways in which Priam’s journey is thematically similar to a spying mission. Higbie (1995:86–87) identifies both of these passages as places where we might expect the first question to be a request for the addressee to identify himself by name, but this happens in neither case. (In fact, after Hermes asks Priam questions about what he is doing using this formula, Priam asks <em>Hermes</em> to identify <em>himself</em>, and Hermes tells a false story in reply.) In the <em>Odyssey</em>, the formula generally introduces a series of further questions (<em>Odyssey</em> 1.169, 1.224, 8.572, 15.383; the exception is <em>Odyssey</em> 11.140, which has only one question that follows). See Finkelberg 1987 for her argument that the verb καταλέγω “connotes both an ordered succession and truth” (Finkelberg 1987:138) and that Homeric epic uses it to represent its own genre.</p>

<p>θοὴν διὰ νύκτα μέλαιναν</p><p>We find this phrase also at <em>Iliad</em> 10.468, 24.366, and 24.653. In <em>Iliad</em> 24, the formula is used during Priam’s infiltration of the Achaean camp, and is associated particularly with the danger of his mission. Thus this formula as a whole seems to be connected with the ambush theme. (See “The Poetics of Ambush” and the commentary above on 10.1ff. on how Priam’s mission to retrieve the body of Hektor shares in the ambush theme.) Night is also “swift” at <em>Iliad</em> 12.463 and 14.261 and <em>Odyssey</em> 12.284. Hainsworth (1993 <em>ad loc.</em>) has tentatively suggested that the phrase may have been composed by analogy with θοὴν ἐπὶ νῆα μέλαιναν (which also occurs in the dative with other prepositions). Certainly these examples suggest that the structure of the phrase is deeply ingrained in the traditional diction and that the adjectives “swift” and “black” go naturally together. But what about night is swift? And is “swift” even the correct definition of θοός? The scholia in the Venetus A, Venetus B, and Townley (T) manuscripts on these lines offer possible associations, such as how quickly the sky becomes black after the sun has set. The T scholia here also note several other possible meanings of θοός besides “swift,” including “pointed” (see Chantraine 1968/1999 s.v. θοός), and discuss the angle of the earth in relation to the sun, which results in shadows with angles that are “sharp” and make night “cone-shaped.” Another possible definition of θοή offered by the B and T scholia is “the placer”: τὴν θετικήν—ἀποτίθησι γὰρ ἡμᾶς εἰς ἀνάπαυλαν (“the placer—for it places us into a state of repose”). This definition associates θοή with the verb τίθημι. The question was considered from a cosmological perspective by the ancient Homeric scholar and philosopher Crates of Mallos, who accepted “swift” (see Eustathius <em>ad</em> 10.394 and Mette 1952:55ff.) and related it to the speed of the sun and the night.  </p>

# Iliad 10.396-399

<p>Repetition is normal and natural within the system of oral composition-in-performance in which the <em>Iliad</em> was composed, and these lines repeat Hektor’s charge for the spying mission at 10.309–312. Each of the lines 10.397–399 is marked with an <em>obelos</em> in the Venetus A: see on 10.51–52 for the Alexandrian scholarly practice of athetesis. The scholia, however, tell us that there is some dispute about whether Aristarchus indeed meant for the <em>obeloi</em> to be placed here: one scholion says that they should be, if we can trust the work of the scholar Ammonios. The second scholion informs us both that, in the work of the scholar Nemesion, he states that no reason for the <em>obeloi</em> is found in the <em>hupomnēmata</em> of Aristarchus, and that the work of Ammonios says that Aristarchus did place those signs in the margin, but in the end took them out. All of this serves as a reminder that we have access to Aristarchus’ work only as mediated by his successors.</p><p>The scholia also inform us that there are recorded differences in how this particular repetition operates: in the version in the main text of the Venetus A, Dolon has changed the person of the verb from Hektor’s third person—find out whether <em>they</em> are making plans—to the second person—find out whether <em>you</em> are making plans—now that Dolon is speaking to those on whom he was intending to spy. (This change seems to be the reason why 10.398 also has the critical mark of a <em>diplē</em> next to it in the Venetus A, which indicates a comment about the language used.) We can compare 10.409–411, where Odysseus repeats the questions that Nestor had given as the charge for their mission. He retains the third-person plural verbs that refer to the Trojans (those lines are marked with <em>obeloi</em> and also with asterisks in the Venetus A, indicating that they are repetitions). The A main scholia indicate that it should still be the third person here, while the intermarginal scholia note that in other manuscripts these verbs are indeed in the third person. If we compare this type of repetition to messengers delivering their message, however, we do find that a pronoun change often happens. For example, when Zeus sends Dream to Agamemnon, he orders him using imperatives and the third-person pronoun for Agamemnon (e.g. “Tell him to arm the Achaeans, who have beautiful hair,” <em>Iliad</em> 2.11), but when Dream speaks to Agamemnon, he uses indicative verbs and the second person (“He has told you to arm the Achaeans, who have beautiful hair,” <br/><em>Iliad</em> 2.28), keeping all other words the same. Similar changes naturally happen, as we can see also at <em>Iliad</em> 9.157, where Agamemnon is speaking about Achilles in the third person, and <em>Iliad</em> 9.299, where Odysseus is delivering the message to Achilles himself. The formulas have such flexibility.</p><p>This phenomenon seen within repeated passages and the disagreement over whether it is the second or third person in 10.398 suggests that this passage is in fact playing on the conventional repetition by messengers. Dolon, after all, was supposed to gather information about the Achaeans and report it back to Hektor. He is not a messenger, and therefore he was not supposed to repeat Hektor’s words to anyone else. When Odysseus likewise repeats Nestor’s questions (10.409–411), he is in the process of obtaining the answers he seeks, not confessing what he was sent to find out, as Dolon is. We noted above (10.314–315) that there is an implicit contrast between Dolon the spy and his father the herald, and here, when Dolon repeats what Hektor asked him to find out, he seems to be doing so more in the mode of the herald he was not supposed to be.</p>

<p>τὸν δ᾽ ἐπιμειδήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς</p><p>The detail of a facial expression within this formulaic reply introduction raises important questions about how such formulas work. We can compare 10.382 and see the same line with only the change of ἐπιμειδήσας for ἀπαμειβόμενος: if the singer uses this facial expression in this context, we have the opportunity to ask what meaning it brings with it. (See Beck 2005 for speech and reply introductions in general. It is important to note that p425 records ἀπαμειβόμενος in this line: see our textual commentary on that papyrus.)</p><p>Smiles that are not spontaneous reactions of joy carry particular meanings within a culture and within a context, and our task in interpreting this line is to decode the meaning of Odysseus’ smile. We might start by asking whether Dolon can see him smile in the dark or whether this smile is for the audience’s “view” only. Another question is whether this verb here means ‘smiling’, or ‘laughing’ (as some have translated it). One potential problem with such translations is that our own cultural expectations as to what is appropriate to the situation may affect what we interpret as smiling and what as laughing, while the traditional audience may have had different expectations. Halliwell (2008:520–529) has recently argued that ancient Greek has separate words for smiling (those with roots in μειδ[ι]ᾶν) and laughing (γελᾶν). He notes that there can be complications in classification of these verbs, but he nevertheless maintains a greater distinction between them than other scholars have, with an emphasis on the vocalization and therefore sound accompanying laughter. Following his distinctions, then, Odysseus’ smile here is silent, and because it occurs in the dark, as we interpret its meaning in this context, we must wonder whether Dolon himself sees it.</p><p>To investigate what the smile means, we can look to other complete instances of this formulaic line, and also at other uses of the verb and its non-compound form μειδάω or μειδιάω, paying particular attention to Odysseus’ other smiles. Why take such an approach? Since oral poetry is composed in performance within a system of specialized grammar and specialized vocabulary (Lord 1960/2000:35–36), accounting for all the examples of how that vocabulary is deployed demonstrates how it operates within the system. The <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> constitute our surviving “database” of the traditional language of this poetry, so we examine what data we have, while being cognizant of the fact that what has survived is a limited “data set” from a larger tradition (see e.g. Parry MHV 4, 9; Lord 1960/2000:47).</p><p>When we examine the fifteen instances of μειδάω, the three instances of μειδιάω, and the four instances of ἐπιμειδάω in the two epics combined, we find that the gods smile eleven times and mortals eleven times. Odysseus smiles most often among mortals, although his status as the hero of the <em>Odyssey</em> may skew the frequency. As we might expect, many of these cases can be understood as smiles of affection between loved ones, whether mortal or immortal. But the complexity of the multiple possible cultural meanings of smiles can also be seen when Hera smiles twice, once at Aphrodite and once to herself (<em>Iliad</em> 14.222–223) after successfully obtaining the alluring <em>zōnē</em> from Aphrodite without revealing her true purpose for it. These smiles seem to indicate deception and self-satisfaction, respectively. In another example, Ajax combines a smile with a grim expression (<em>Iliad</em> 7.212) as he enters a duel with Hektor, presenting us with a menacing smile that reveals a desire for victory in battle. Halliwell (2008:55–58) describes this smile as one of “bloodlust” and cites Odysseus’ smile here as the closest parallel to it. And, of course, Odysseus’ famously described “sardonic smile” after he dodges the ox foot that Ktesippos throws at him (<em>Odyssey</em> 20.301–302) conveys a nexus of emotions including contempt and a desire for revenge.</p><p>These last two examples give us good comparisons for the context of this smile: instead of a smile between loved ones, we have also in this case a smile between or about enemies. When we look at the syntactical context of these verbs, we also see that they are used in speech introductions or reactions to speeches (five of the smiles happen in speech introductions; in thirteen cases, the smile comes in reaction to the words of another, either with no speech following or another line introducing the response; in four cases, the smile occurs in narrative between speeches). When we narrow our focus down to the compound form ἐπιμειδάω, which we have in this line, all four instances of this verb are part of the formula τὸν δ᾽ ἐπιμειδήσας προσέφη + epithet + name (<em>Iliad</em> 4.356, <em>Iliad</em> 8.38, and <em>Odyssey</em> 22.371, the last of which matches exactly the line we have here). So smiling at someone within this specialized vocabulary is associated directly with speaking to that person.</p><p>As we noted, Odysseus is the mortal who smiles most often in these two epics: here in this line and then three times in the <em>Odyssey</em>. All other mortals who smile with these verbs (Agamemnon, Hektor, Achilles, Menelaos, Telemakhos, Ajax, and Antilokhos) do so only once in our “database.” Odysseus is also most often the mortal smiled at (by Agamemnon, Telemakhos, Athena, and Kalypso) and is once the cause of the smile (Antilokhos). Again, this frequency may be a coincidence of having the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus’ story, as one of the two epics we have to examine. But it does also seem to be part of his characterization, especially that he smiles at foes: the sardonic smile toward the suitors and the smile at Medon (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.371), as well as his smile at Dolon here. In Levine’s (1984) analysis of Odysseus’ three smiles in the <em>Odyssey</em>, his argument is framed explicitly in terms of disproving “Parry’s insistence on economy as a basic principle of composition”; instead his approach, he claims, will show how to “determine one among a series of different meanings which could be attached to traditional language” (1). In other words, Levine sets up an opposition between Parry’s concept of thrift and the idea that a formula such as the one we see in this line can generate meaning in context. He concludes, “Since the psychology behind Odysseus’ smiles changes in accordance with the development of the narrative, we see how Homeric formulaic language can be charged with thematic meaning” (Levine 1984:8–9). Levine is focused in that article especially on the smiles of Odysseus at <em>Odyssey</em> 20.301, 22.371, and 23.111, but his arguments have been influential about smiles in Homeric epic in general, giving us an opportunity to reexamine Parry’s concept of thrift and how exactly formulaic language does generate meaning in context.</p><p>Taking Parry’s idea of economy or thrift to mean that a formula does not respond to context is an all too common misunderstanding of it. Here is how Parry defines thrift: “The thrift of a system lies in the degree to which it is free of phrases which, having the same metrical value and expressing the same idea, could replace one another” (MHV, 276). We have already seen that ἐπιμειδήσας has the same metrical value as ἀπαμειβόμενος, so according to this definition, they do not express the same idea if they adhere to the principle of thrift. But the idea of thrift does not at all imply that the meaning of any one word is diminished, and that is what Levine seems to be arguing against. All Parry’s argument about the thrift of system is saying is that the system would not include another metrically equivalent word or phrase to mean ‘smiling’, not that smiles cannot mean different things in different contexts. (As discussed above at 10.41, if such a metrically equivalent word or phrase for smiling did exist, we would expect it to carry with it a difference in “idea,” such as tone, theme, or meaning).</p><p>Levine explicitly says he is following those critics who have demonstrated “Homer’s relative freedom from the shackles of a traditional system” (1984:1). Yet Albert Lord has demonstrated in clear and straightforward terms that the singer is not shackled by the tradition, because he <em>is</em> the tradition. Formulas are the singer’s craft and he uses them in service to the song: “Indeed, it is easy to see that he employs a set phrase because it is useful and answers his need, but it is not sacrosanct. What stability it has comes from its utility, not from a feeling on the part of the singer that it cannot or must not be changed. It, too, is capable of adjustment. In making his lines the singer is not bound by the formula. The formulaic technique was developed to serve him as a craftsman, not to enslave him” (Lord 1960/2000:53–54). And as John Foley has persuasively argued throughout his work (1991, 1995, 1999, 2002), in oral traditional poetry such formulas accrue <em>more</em> meaning through time, not less, and, importantly, a particular instance is not limited to one among a series of meanings. A traditional singer and a traditional audience bring to the interpretation of this smile their recollections of all other instances of Odysseus smiling and of similar smiling situations, as represented by the formula of this speech introduction, in their understanding of what kind of smile it is. Because Levine’s arguments are based on false premises about thrift and how the formulaic, traditional language creates meaning, his distinctions about cases that exhibit “a greater sensitivity to plot movement and sophisticated composition” (Levine 1984:7) are deeply flawed. As Lord reminds us about oral traditional singing, “The complexity and artistry of the result are often surprising to anyone who feels that illiterate singers can produce only simple structures” (Lord 1960/2000:54).</p><p>With an acknowledgement of the possibility of such artistry and complexity, then, we can return to our attempt to discover the <em>traditional</em> meaning underlying this particular smile. So far we have seen that within the system of Homeric poetry this smile should be interpreted in terms of Odysseus’ relationship (one of enmity) with and reaction to Dolon, and that it may be characteristic of Odysseus to smile in this way, but that we have to understand all of this from the standpoint of oral poetics. The closest parallel is the same speech introduction formula used in <em>Odyssey</em> 22.371, when Medon is asking Odysseus to spare his life and Odysseus smiles at him before reassuring him that he will do so. In an earlier article, Levine argues that reassurance is the meaning of this formulaic speech introduction: “The words τὸν/τὴν δ᾽ ἐπιμειδήσας προσέφη always introduce speeches of reassurance. The essential meaning of this formula is ‘He smiled reassuringly at him/her.’ The facial expression so described is meant to have a calming effect” (Levine 1982:101). In the case of Medon, this seems to be so, as the speech that follows does indeed reassure him that he will live.</p><p>In the case of Odysseus’ interrogation of Dolon, such an interpretation might make Odysseus the “good cop” to Diomedes’ “bad cop” (see below on 10.446 for Diomedes’ very different facial expression). Levine applies such a meaning to this case as well: “Odysseus smiles at a fearful Dolon (10.400) in order to calm his fears and have him continue his report” (Levine 1982:101). This interpretation assumes, of course, that Dolon can see Odysseus’ smile. Such a characterization of the speech that follows the introductory formula, as a speech of reassurance, applies better to Odysseus’ previous speech, when he does indeed begin by telling Dolon to take courage and put thoughts of death from his mind. That speech is introduced without the smile, however (10.382–383). Here, the beginning of the speech is Odysseus’ reaction to the thought of Dolon driving Achilles’ horses, and any reassuring Odysseus does is to assure Dolon that he has reached too far in thinking that he is worthy of such a prize.</p><p>Should we take this smile to be one of amusement or derision, then, or what else might this tell us about Odysseus’ character? Levine compares <em>Odyssey</em> 22.371 with this line in asserting that both of these smiles express Odysseus’ “security and confidence in his superior position” (1984:6) and notes in his earlier work that victory and amusement are not mutually exclusive, but that a smile can, in fact, indicate both (1982:102). The smile as a sign of confidence seems to come closer to the situation in this line than does a notion of reassuring Dolon. Lateiner argues that Odysseus’ “smiles (especially the sardonic one [<em>Odyssey</em> 20.301–302]) characterize menacing resources and mark each context as a significant, if ambivalent, moment” (1995:42). If that is so, what, then, would be the significance of this moment? Does Odysseus’ smile indicate that from Dolon’s initial response Odysseus knows he will get the information he wants from him? One more possible characterization: Corrine Pache, while agreeing with Levine’s argument that it is a speech of reassurance, focuses on Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em> alone, and she notes that he is unlike other heroes in that he does not cry in this epic. That observation leads her to conclude that this smile “reveals gleeful indifference to the other man’s fate” (Pache 2000:19) and that Odysseus’ intentions when he smiles are “of the coldest and cruelest kind” (2000:20). In other words, if Odysseus can smile while Dolon begs for his life and blames Hektor for his predicament, does that indicate an emotional disengagement?</p><p>In a traditional song culture, these varying interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Let us remember that this smile carries with it associations from past performances for the audience. So Odysseus’ smile could show his confidence that he has Dolon right where he wants him in terms of getting information out of him, his derision at the prospect of Dolon receiving the prize of Achilles’ horses, and an overall characterization of one who smiles at his enemies before taking vengeance upon them. The traditional nature of this introductory line can imbue it with greater meaning, yet for a singer singing in performance, the immediate context, what Dolon just said and what Odysseus was about to say, may have called for a smile from Odysseus related to these many meanings. (See Lord 1960/2000:54 for the reminder that “lines cannot be isolated from what precedes them.”) The meaning here combines this immediate context with that from the larger tradition. That combination and its resulting complexity of meaning does not contradict Parry’s concept of thrift.</p><p>As we mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, however, p425 does not include the smile at all, but rather has the common formula including ἀπαμειβόμενος ‘answering’. Thus in a performance, a singer may not include this detail, as revealing as we may find it. We may think that a <em>better</em> singer would include it, but there are so many factors involved, including the experience and training of the singer, the versions of this episode he has heard from others, and the pressures of rapid composition-in-performance, that we cannot make this judgment for certain. What is important to keep in mind is that these performance variations do exist, even in our textual record.</p>

<p>Odysseus asks Dolon what Nestor had wanted them to find out, and in oral traditional style, he asks using the same words Nestor himself used: compare 10.409–411 to 10.208–210. Thus we might notice that here Odysseus does fulfill the objectives of the spying mission, even as it is in the process of evolving into an ambush. Nestor, after all, had suggested that they might get this information by capturing one of the enemy (10.206). There is a consistency to the mission. But we should also note that Odysseus asks other questions first, about Hektor, armor, horses, and the arrangement of the night watches. Fenik (1964:19–20) argues that there was another version in which the night mission was to assassinate Hektor (which is seen briefly in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>). We might, however, understand Odysseus’ question about Hektor as being related to the question of what the Trojans are planning to do, since it was Hektor’s idea in the first place to camp on the plain during this night. But the questions about armor, horses, and night watches are directly relevant to what comes next: infiltrating the enemy camp and stealing horses. Dolon’s immediate response covers Hektor and the night watches. That response prompts Odysseus’ further questions about the allies, and then Dolon’s answer includes horses and armor, specifically the spectacular horses and armor of Rhesos. In terms of the sequence of information gathered, Odysseus’ questions here can be seen to prompt Dolon’s revelation that Rhesos has arrived. But in a larger sense, these questions may also reflect the traditional theme of night raids, and their traditional outcomes: targeting a leader through ambush and getting horses and armor through plunder. Understood in a traditional framework, neither the questions themselves nor the actions they lead to seem disjointed or strange from the point of view of the original mission.</p>

<p>D.M. Gaunt argues that these lines are the point at which the theme changes from a spying mission, or “reconnaissance-story,” to “a direct attack” (1971:197). Gaunt postulates that there were at one time two traditional episodes, one that focused on reconnaissance and the other on an assassination of “Hector or some great hero” (1971:195). (See also on 10.282.) Gaunt argues that when oral poetry is composed and performed, “paratactic” thinking allows for this kind of shift, since both the singer and the audience are most focused on the immediate scene. We disagree with Gaunt’s characterization of oral composition as primitive and his assertion “that sometimes the narrative leads the poet” (1971:195). Instead, we can see how these themes are linked in ways that Lord (1960/2000) and Petegorsky (1982) have explored, a phenomenon that reveals the complexity, rather than the simple-mindedness, of oral traditional epic. (Note that Hainsworth 1993 calls 10.433–441 the “turning-point of the Book.”) </p>

<p>τοὶ γὰρ ἐγώ τοι ταῦτα μάλ’ ἀτρεκέως καταλέξω</p><p>In several sources the verb here is ἀγορεύσω (see textual commentary on the Venetus A for more detail). We see this whole-line formula elsewhere in the Homeric epics, with the multiforms of καταλέξω and ἀγορεύσω. In <em>Odyssey</em> 4.399, Eidothea uses this same formula to introduce her instructions to Menelaos on how to ambush Proteus. She is not a captive of Menelaos, and so the main use of this formula seems to be as an introduction to a detailed set of information, and ambush requires such details to be successful. The formula seems also to be associated with false identities in answering the question of who one is: compare <em>Odyssey</em> 1.179, where Athena claims to be Mentes, and <em>Odyssey</em> 14.192, where Odysseus uses the line to introduce his Cretan lie to Eumaios. The “trickiness” on display in those answers might also be a point of connection with the ambush theme. We should note, however, that here Dolon is not being obviously tricky, unless we understand that by mentioning that the allies are unguarded he is diverting Odysseus from going after the Trojans and Hektor himself. In any case, Hektor, we know, is awake and not an ambush target on this night.  </p>

# Iliad 10.415

<p>θείου παρὰ σήματι Ἴλου  </p><p>From the geneaology of the Trojan royal family that Aeneas tells Achilles at <em>Iliad</em> 20.213–240, we learn that Ilos was the son of Tros, the father of Laomedon, and grandfather of Priam. His name is related to the name of Ilion. His grave mound acts as a landmark on the Trojan plain: both its prominence and the adjective θείου suggest that it was the site of a hero cult for Ilos (see Nagy 1979 on hero cult and the Homeric epics). This landmark also appears in two other episodes related to ambush. In <em>Iliad</em> 11, Paris hides behind the stele on the grave mound as he shoots an arrow at Diomedes (<em>Iliad</em> 11.369–383; at <em>Iliad</em> 11.372 Ilos is called Dardanos’ son, perhaps meaning descendant, or perhaps reflecting a different geneaology: see Gantz 1993:557–558 for the question). This grave mound acts as a landmark again at <em>Iliad</em> 24.349, when Priam journeys to the Achaean camp to ransom Hektor’s body. After they pass the grave mound, Priam and his herald stop to water the horses and mules at the river, and it is there that Hermes meets them (see “The Poetics of Ambush” for both of these episodes as related to the ambush theme, and also 10.1ff. for Priam’s night journey). That Hermes meets them at this point suggests that Priam is then in a dangerous space and needs protection (as Thornton 1984:154 also observes). The grave mound is also used as a landmark during the daytime fighting: when Agamemnon routs the Trojans, they pass by this grave mound (<em>Iliad</em> 11.166) and then the fig tree as they move to the city. Thornton identifies the features of the Trojan landscape, in order from the walls of Troy to the ships of the Achaeans as: “the oak-tree of Zeus, the fig-tree, the tomb of Ilus, the ford of the Scamander, the “rise” or hillock on the plain, and the Achaean ditch or wall” (Thornton 1984:150; see also Hainsworth 1993:243 on <em>Iliad</em> 11.166 for this grave mound’s place in the Trojan landscape). Thus we can see that the Trojans are rather close to the Achaeans on this night, and that the fearful thoughts Agamemnon has at the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 10 are justified.</p><p>The spatial information Dolon gives here in terms of this landmark will recur in even greater detail in his subsequent answers. Spatial indications are important to ambushers moving through the darkness. (See also Clay 2007 on spatial indications in descriptions of battle in Homeric poetry.)</p>

<p>The lack of watches among the allies creates a situation ripe for ambush, and we can at least consider the possibility that Dolon gives this information, as well as the information about Rhesos and the Thracians in his next response, to divert the Achaeans away from the Trojans themselves. We have seen night watches arranged by the Trojans before this night: when the previous night fell, Priam set up a night watch around the city of Troy (<em>Iliad</em> 7.370–371; these same lines appear again at <em>Iliad</em> 18.298–299, when Hektor likewise sets up a night watch on the night following this one). The implication of those watches is that a night ambush may happen on any night (and, of course, we do hear about such episodes at Troy at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.244–258 and <em>Odyssey</em> 14.468–503). Because the Trojan army and its allies are spending this night out on the Trojan plain, however, more elaborate arrangements are made as night falls at the end of <em>Iliad</em> 8. The night watch in the city will on this night be manned by elders and boys, while the women light fires, all to prevent an attack on the city while the army is outside it (<em>Iliad</em> 8.517–522). Hektor also establishes a watch “on ourselves” (<em>Iliad</em> 8.529), and the fires he orders lit so that they can see if the Achaeans try to sail away (<em>Iliad</em> 8.507–511) number one thousand, with fifty men and their horses stationed at each (<em>Iliad</em> 8.562–565). The allies are not mentioned separately at this point, but Dolon’s words here make it appear that they are not included in those groups around the watch fires. At the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 10, we can recall, Agamemnon both saw these fires and heard music and men talking around them (<em>Iliad</em> 10.11–13). So there is a key contrast here between the awake and watchful Trojans and the sleeping allies—and also one between the kind of watch that the Achaeans arrange for the whole army (see <em>Iliad</em> 9.66–88) and the more diffuse watches of the Trojans.</p><p>This latter arrangement may show how unusual the situation is for the Trojans: camping out on the plain for the first time, they are grouped as if they had gone to their family homes within the city. This arrangement is also consistent with what we see of the Trojans elsewhere in the <em>Iliad</em>. Gould argues that Trojan society “is a model based on an almost complete equation between the city of Troy and the οἶκος ‘household/family’ of Priam, with the consequence that ties of obligation in Troy are seen as those that obtain within an extended family” (2001:343–344). The fact that the watch fires are here called “home-fires” (πυρὸς ἐσχάραι, 10.418) reinforces the idea that these are family groups, each responsible for its own watch.</p>

<p>ἥρως</p><p>This term often is used as the sixth foot in a line (over twenty times in the Homeric epics), and is used as a vocative (in any metrical position, but most often in the first or sixth foot) four times in the <em>Iliad</em> and four times in the <em>Odyssey</em>, either alone, as here (see also <em>Iliad</em> 20.104, <em>Odyssey</em> 4.423, 7.303, 10.516), or with the personal name of the hero (<em>Iliad</em> 11.819 and 11.838 with Eurypylos and <em>Odyssey</em> 4.312 with Telemakhos). So although Hainsworth (1993:194), commenting on this line, says that “the unqualified vocative in the sixth foot in mid-speech is otiose and rare,” isolating this usage with that many qualifications may be overstating it. The equivalent nominative form is often found in the sixth foot, and there is even a fairly common formula that uses it in this position, αὐτὰρ ὅ γ’ ἥρως (<em>Iliad</em> 5.308. 5.327, 8.268, 11.483, 13.164, 23.896), indicating that this word in the sixth foot was useful and good for composing-in-performance. The other vocative uses in this position that appear in our texts, it is true, are those in which ἥρως modifies a name, but since the vocative is used elsewhere, to find this particular use strange may be a case of already concluding that <em>Iliad</em> 10 as a whole is strange, and using this as one more piece of evidence for that conclusion. From a compositional point of view, a word often used in the sixth foot could easily be used in this way by analogy.  </p>

Thornton (1984:150) argues that most places in the topography of Troy “are consistently associated with a particular sort of situation or with a particular party or person in the poem.” Thymbrē, mentioned only here in our <em>Iliad</em>, is associated with ambush in the larger epic tradition about the Trojan War. It is the site of Achilles’ ambush of Troilos (according to the scholia in the Townley manscript on <em>Iliad</em> 24.257; see also Apollodorus, <em>Epitome</em> 3.32) and also the site where Achilles himself is killed in an ambush by Paris and Apollo (see above on 10.29). It is also known as the place where Laokoon’s sons are killed (see Gantz 1993:648).

# Iliad 10.433

<p>εἰ γὰρ δὴ μέματον Τρώων καταδῦναι ὅμιλον</p><p>We also find this use of καταδύω to mean ‘go behind enemy lines’ in an ambush theme at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.246: ἀνδρῶν δυσμενέων κατέδυ πόλιν εὐρυάγυιαν, and again at 4.249. (Athena’s action at <em>Iliad</em> 4.86 seems to have a similar flavor, but Apollo also “sinks into” the crowd of Trojans below at 10.517, and the Trojans are not his enemy, so the verb seems to specify gods visiting mortals in those cases.) It is also used to mean ‘enter’ battle (<em>Iliad</em> 3.241 and 18.134).   </p>

# Iliad 10.435

<p>The scholia on this line in the Venetus A, Venetus B, and Townley manuscripts provide information on the multiform, traditional story of Rhesos. See the section on Rhesos in our essay “Tradition and Reception” for the texts of these scholia and a full discussion. As we saw on 10.406–411, Odysseus’ question about the horses and armor in general might have prompted this answer. Or Dolon may be directing them to the allies “furthest” from the rest in an attempt to deflect a more destructive attack. But in this version, in which Rhesos has not yet fought in battle at Troy and in which we have no oracle about his possible invincibility, it is through Dolon’s “advice” here that Rhesos becomes a target. That Rhesos is the son of an Eioneus here, and not the river Strymon as he is elsewhere, also serves to make him a more “mortal” target, although one still important as a king of freshly arrived troops who has spectacular horses. </p>

# Iliad 10.436-437

<p>The horses of Rhesos are thematically significant in multiple ways. In one version of the story of Rhesos (see the Rhesos section of our essay “Tradition and Reception”), the so-called “oracle version,” Rhesos’ horses are intimately tied to the destiny of Rhesos and to that of Troy, since the oracle declares that, if Rhesos and his horses eat and drink at Troy, Rhesos will be invincible. The whiteness of the horses, as we see later in this episode (see commentary on 10.547), makes them highly visible even in the dark of night. (Schnapp-Goubeillon sees a ritual significance to their color, saying that a white horse is the sacrificial victim par excellence in horse cults, 1981:117.) Their size and swiftness, noted by Dolon here, also make them a valuable prize. The practical and symbolic importance of horses in general in the <em>Iliad</em> is evident in the singer’s questions that follow the catalog of ships: the narrator asks who had the “best” horses as well as who was the best warrior (<em>Iliad</em> 2.761–770). That is, horses seem to be as much a part of the competition to be the best as is excellence in battle. (The answer given to these questions is that Achilles and his horses were the best, but only after it has been said that Eumelos’ mares and Telamonian Ajax were the best so long as Achilles was absent.) The value of horses is also seen in Diomedes’ acquisition of his enemies’ horses in <em>Iliad</em> 5. When he gives instructions to Sthenelos to capture the horses of Aeneas at <em>Iliad</em> 5.263–273, the most prominent example, Diomedes says capturing them will win them good <em>kleos</em> (εἰ τούτω κε λάβοιμεν, ἀροίμεθά κε κλέος ἐσθλόν, <em>Iliad</em> 5.273), making their symbolic value glory itself.</p><p>The possibility of taking these horses, when added to the attractiveness of the target of the sleeping, unguarded Thracians, combines ambush with horse-rustling, a closely associated theme. We will consider below (at 10.513–514) whether the theme of horse-rustling affects the composition of this nighttime horse-stealing episode, as compared to the taking of horses in daytime battle. But just as we have seen that spying missions frequently become ambushes, so also can ambushes incorporate this type of night raid (see pp. 80–84 of “The Poetics of Ambush” for other examples).</p><p>Shewan 1911:179–180 has already dismissed the argument that the lack of reference to these horses subsequently in the <em>Iliad</em> is evidence that <em>Iliad</em> 10 is a late addition to the epic.</p>

<p>The elaborate chariot and gold armor of Rhesos also mark him as an important and desirable target. Agamemnon’s armor includes gold (<em>Iliad</em> 11.25), as does the armor Hephaistos makes for Achilles (<em>Iliad</em> 18.475, 549, 612). Gold armor is memorably seen elsewhere in the exchange between Diomedes and Glaukos, in which Glaukos gives Diomedes his gold armor for Diomedes’ bronze as a sign of their inherited guest-friendship (<em>Iliad</em> 6.232–236). Nestor also has an all-gold shield, which Hektor hopes to capture. He says that if he does take Nestor’s shield, along with Diomedes’ breastplate, then the Achaeans will depart that very night (<em>Iliad</em> 8.191–197)—in fact, the night on which this ambush episode occurs. So there may be an association between the taking of gold armor and the outcome of the war, and Rhesos’ gold and silver chariot and gold armor may have a similar significance, relating it to versions of the Rhesos story in which his death prevents a possible Trojan victory (see “Tradition and Reception” for a full discussion of these other versions).</p><p>The phrase θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι is used elsewhere in the <em>Iliad</em> for armor (that which Achilles inherits from Peleus but which Hektor is wearing at that point, <em>Iliad</em> 18.83) and other golden objects (Hebe’s chariot, <em>Iliad</em> 5.725, and Hephaistos’ wheeled tripods, <em>Iliad</em> 18.377). Since Achilles’ original armor was a wedding gift to Peleus from the gods, all these examples are also associated with the gods, as Rhesos’ armor is in Dolon’s words. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, θαῦμα ἰδέσθαι is associated with cloth or clothing (<em>Odyssey</em> 6.306, 8.366, 13.108) or buildings (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.45), but always those of divinities or the Phaeacians. From a compositional point of view, then, the following comment that his armor seems like that of the immortals is an expansion of this phrase.</p>

# Iliad 10.446

<p>ὑπόδρα ἰδών is another formulaic facial expression that is part of speech introductions (compare 10.400). This look is given at least twenty-six times in the two epics, twenty times within the formula τὸν/τὴν/τοὺς δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη + epithet + name (thirteen times in the <em>Iliad</em>, seven in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Holoka 1983:3n6; Beck 2005:34, 284). Holoka, quoting Stanford, asserts that “The actual facial expression signified by ὑπόδρα ἰδών is quite unmistakable: ‘looking (out) from beneath (scil. beetling or knit) brows’,” and also cites research on facial expressions for the “distinctiveness of this positioning of the brows as a universally recognized sign of anger” (1983:4n8). That anger, Holoka argues, is a reaction to what the previous speaker has just said. In sum, Holoka argues: “In both Homeric epics, to look darkly is to employ a nonverbal cue fraught with judgmental significance. The speaker, whatever his message, transmits by his facial demeanor that an infraction of propriety has occurred … In all instances, the facial gesture ὑπόδρα ἰδών charges the speech it introduces with a decidedly minatory fervency and excitement: a threshold has been reached and such inflammable materials as wounded pride, righteous indignation, frustration, shame, and shock are nearing the combustion point” (1983:16). Holoka is focusing especially on the cases (twelve times in the <em>Iliad</em>) in which this look is given by one comrade (often a superior) to another (often a subordinate), and he says that the situation with Dolon is a different case because it is between enemies (1983:8).</p><p>In fact, the most telling parallels for this fierce look of Diomedes at Dolon come from the <em>Odyssey</em>, where Odysseus gives this look to the suitors, either individually (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.60, 22.320) or as a group (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.34), as well as to Iros (<em>Odyssey</em> 18.14) and the disloyal slave Melantho (<em>Odyssey</em> 18.337, 19.70). (These last two are exceptional in that the look is given to a woman; other than Zeus looking at Hera this way, all those who receive the expression are male. But the formula is flexible in accommodating the gender change.) These looks given to the suitors show both contempt and suspicion, anger and fear, and we can see this same mix of emotions in the words of Diomedes that follow this instance. Both Diomedes here and Odysseus in <em>Odyssey</em> 22 follow up this look at an enemy with beheading him. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus gives this look to Leiodes, the suitor who, as we hear upon his introduction as the first to try the bow (<em>Odyssey</em> 21.144–147), had found the reckless deeds of the suitors hateful and felt righteous indignation toward them. It is this man who supplicates Odysseus; Odysseus rejects his plea for mercy and beheads him (see also below on 10.456–457). Given to an enemy, then (and we can add that Achilles gives this look to Hektor three times at <em>Iliad</em> 20.428, 22.260, 22.344), this look carries with it a danger of sudden violence: the combustion point is not merely approached, it is quickly reached. So here also we see the flexibility of the formula within its context: the essential meaning of the expression is maintained, but the expectation of what will follow is shaped by whether the look is given to a comrade or to an enemy.</p><p>As we saw above on 10.400, these telling facial expressions are sometimes absent in other versions. Allen’s (and subsequently, West’s) papyrus 90 (Oxyrhynchus 6.949) has the possible multiform [τον δ ημειβετ επειτα βοην αγα]θος Διομηδης. See 10.283 for more on this multiform.</p>

# Iliad 10.447

<p>μὴ δή μοι φύξίν γε Δόλων ἐμβάλλεο θυμῷ</p><p>The scholia in the Venetus A and B and Townley manuscripts on this line are all concerned with the fact that Diomedes calls Dolon by name, when Dolon has not told them his name. In the Venetus A, the line is marked with a <em>diplē</em>, indicating that Aristarchus made a comment about the language of the line. The lemma in this manuscript for the comment is actually the beginning of the line, demonstrating that a lemma can be simply an indication of the line being commented on, and not the specific words concerned. The scholion in the Venetus A explains that the line is marked “because Aristarchus is asking, how does he know the name? Thus some read ‘δολῶν’ [that is, “being tricky”], like νοῶν [that is, the participle would be formed the same way].” With this alternative reading, the line would read “Don’t be tricky and put thoughts of escape in your heart.” There is at least a sound-alike connection between Dolon’s name and δόλος ‘trick’ (see also Higbie 1995:12). The scholion goes on to point out that Odysseus also later uses Dolon’s name, in 10.478, implying that it cannot be the participle there, and so we have to accept that Diomedes and Odysseus know his name without knowing exactly how they know it. The scholion goes on to suggest that it is likely that they would know the names of some men, since it has been ten years, and perhaps especially Dolon’s since he is the son of a herald who is wealthy (citing 10.315). The scholia in the other two manuscripts take a similar approach to the problem, noting Dolon’s father’s role as a herald and that Dolon is among the leaders of the Trojans who are called to the meeting earlier in the book, or suggesting simply that we should understand that they asked his name when they overpowered him. Higbie (1995:87) compares a similar case in the <em>Odyssey</em> in which the narrator has introduced Theoklymenos to the audience, and Telemakhos knows his name without a direct introduction within the narrative. This concern for how they know his name, although understandable from a literary point of view, does not apply to an oral traditional narrative composed in performance. As Hainsworth (1993:197 <em>ad</em> 10.447) affirms, “what his audience knows an epic poet may let his characters know too.”  </p>

<p>Diomedes kills Dolon before Dolon can touch him in a gesture of supplication. On supplication in Homeric epic, see Crotty 1994, Wilson 2002, and Naiden 2006. According to these analyses of the act of supplication, Dolon’s supplication begins at 10.378–381 with his offer of ransom (<em>apoina</em>) if he can be taken alive (see also our comments at 10.378–381). At that point, Odysseus and Diomedes have grabbed Dolon’s hands, so that he is unable to make this clasping gesture. (Such a scene is visualized by the Dokimasia painter on a kylix cup from c. 480 BCE [St. Petersburg, Hermitage B.1539], with Dolon pictured in his wolf skin.) According to Naiden’s arguments, the person being supplicated always has the freedom to reject the request, as Diomedes does here (see Naiden 2006:181 for this particular example of supplication).</p>

# Iliad 10.455-457

<p>Beheading the enemy, as gruesome or repulsive as it may seem to a modern audience, does occur several times in the Homeric epics, either as the method of killing or as an act carried out after killing, and in most cases, it is the Achaeans who do it. In <em>Iliad</em> 13, the two Ajaxes take the corpse of the Trojan Imbrios, a husband of one of Priam’s illegitimate daughters. They strip the corpse of his armor, and Ajax, son of Oileus, cuts off Imbrios’ head and throws it so that it ends up at Hektor’s feet (<em>Iliad</em> 13.201–205). Oilean Ajax, the rapist of Kassandra, is known to commit war atrocities during the sack of Troy, but this beheading happens during the course of regular, daytime battle. Achilles beheads Deukalion at <em>Iliad</em> 20.481–483 after pinning his arm with a spear (in other words, Deukalion cannot fight back at that moment). Although Achilles is acting beyond normal human boundaries at this point in his story, he is also depicted in two sixth-century vase paintings as beheading Troilos (see Gantz 1993:600), an incident much earlier in the war, and one that also involves ambush. Agamemnon beheads Köon over the body of his brother Iphidamas (τοῖο δ’ ἐπ’ Ἰφιδάμαντι κάρη ἀπέκοψε παραστάς, <em>Iliad</em> 11.261) without hesitation. Hektor plans to behead Patroklos’ corpse after he strips it (<em>Iliad</em> 17.126). In a series of back-and-forth killings with vaunting afterwards, Penelos kills Ilioneus, a Trojan introduced as he dies as the beloved of Hermes and an only child of a wealthy man. Penelos’ spear hits Ilioneus in the eyesocket, and then Penelos cuts off Ilioneus’ head with his sword and holds it up, helmet still on and spear still in eyesocket, to show it to the Trojans (<em>Iliad</em> 14.493–507). All of these examples come from the battle that rages on the day following this night, when the fighting is most intense and the stakes at their highest for the Achaeans.</p><p>The closest parallel to the beheading of Dolon in terms of language and situation, however, occurs during Odysseus’ ambush of the suitors. During the slaughter in Odysseus’ home, Leiodes supplicates Odysseus, but Odysseus kills him anyway (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.310–329). In both cases, then, there is an attempted supplication, and a verbal response followed by a swift beheading. As Odysseus responds to Leiodes’ arguments for why he should be spared, Odysseus gives him the same fierce look (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.320) that Diomedes gives Dolon here (see 10.446). In both cases the killer drives a sword through the victim’s neck (αὐχένα μέσσον ἔλασσε, <em>Iliad</em> 10.455, <em>Odyssey</em> 22.328), and the graphic detail of the victim’s head still talking as it mixes with the dust is included (<em>Iliad</em> 10.457 = <em>Odyssey</em> 22.329). We may certainly question how these actions inform the character of the killers and the action of the episode, but we must also recognize that beheading is “Homeric” in the sense that the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> represent it as happening in the intensity of battle and of ambush.</p>

# Iliad 10.456

<p>φασγάνῳ ἀΐξας</p><p>This formula is used to describe a particular cutting motion with the sword. ἀίσσω generally refers to any quick motion, but we can see from the few other uses of this phrase in the Iliad that it means to use the sword to cut rather than to stab. At <em>Iliad</em> 5.81, Eurypylos flashes his sword at Hypsenor and cuts off his arm. In <em>Iliad</em> 8, one of Nestor’s horses has been struck with an arrow as Nestor is trying to retreat from the battlefield. Nestor uses his sword at <em>Iliad</em> 8.88 (there the present participle ἀίσσων is used instead of the aorist participle) to cut the harness straps from that horse in his attempt to escape (compare the use of ἀΐξας alone for cutting a horse loose at <em>Iliad</em> 16.474). Thus we should imagine this motion to be quick, with the edge of the sword positioned to cut through whatever it is aimed at. The one use of the phrase in the <em>Odyssey</em> (at 22.98) occurs when Telemakhos is afraid that one of the suitors will attack him in this way if he stops to remove his spear from one of his victims during the battle with the suitors; it gives no other indications about what the motion is. As in all of the cases in the <em>Iliad</em>, however, the example from the <em>Odyssey</em> does show that this phrase is used in a line initial position, enjambed with the previous line. That consistent position gives us an important clue as to how a singer would use this phrase in performance.  </p>

<p>If we compare these lines depicting the stripping of Dolon’s weapons and “armor” (the wolf skin) to the arming scene at 10.333–335 where he put them on, we find that different epithets or adjectives and even names of the items are used here. Such differences suggest that compositionally the theme of stripping armor employs different combinations of formulas to represent the same items described in arming scenes. The ambush-related items nevertheless remain prominent: the headgear made of animal hide, the animal skin, and the bow. Holoka (1983:9) calls this stripping of armor “a near parody of standard battlefield practice” particularly because of the “paltry panoply” of the wolf skin, spear, and bow. Yet it is precisely this panoply that will indicate that Diomedes and Odysseus have ambushed an ambusher. </p>

<p>In the prayers to Athena at the outset of the mission, both Odysseus and Diomedes emphasize their personal relationships with Athena in asking for her help and protection (see commentary on 10.275 and 10.291). In this address to the goddess, that request is renewed, but their initial success in capturing and killing Dolon is associated with the goddess as well. Athena’s prominent role not only here but also in the <em>Odyssey</em> reveals her to be a goddess of ambush. At <em>Odyssey</em> 20.44–51, she tells Odysseus that, with her on his side, they could take far more men than the suitors and drive away their livestock, a description that combines the ambush narrative pattern of one or two killing many with that of a cattle raid. Odysseus similarly states earlier that, with Athena on his side, he could fight three hundred suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.389–391). Proklos’ summary of the epic <em>Little Iliad</em> describes the building of the wooden horse as “according to Athena’s plan of action” (κατ’ Ἀθηνᾶς προαίρεσιν), indicating that she is the mastermind of that ultimate ambush at Troy. On the shield of Achilles (<em>Iliad</em> 18.516), Athena and Ares together lead an ambush from the city at war. And it is of course Athena who warns Telemakhos about his impending ambush by the suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 15.28). Stagakis (1987–88:70) examines the language here in detail and concludes that this passage does “not indicate that the spoils were vowed or dedicated to Athena,” but the technicalities of the religious nature of what is or is not happening here do not diminish the association between Athena and ambush. </p>

We have seen other hints that ambushes and night raids are associated especially with young men, those at the right age for such an initiation (Odysseus would be an exception, of course): see commentary on 10.259.

# Iliad 10.466-468

<p>We see here another example of details appropriate to nocturnal actions. Odysseus and Diomedes could leave these spoils behind without worrying that someone else will take them during the night; instead, the concern is that they may not be able to find them again in the darkness, hence the need to make a sign conspicuously or clearly (δέελον δ᾽ ἐπι σήματ᾽ ἔθηκε, 10.466). Odysseus creates such a sign by tying the branches of the tamarisk tree (a large, dense, shrub-like tree) to the reeds below. We will see later, of course, that this sign works, when Odysseus and Diomedes stop and pick these spoils up on their return (10.526–529). This sort of planning is necessary in the dark.</p><p>The tamarisk grows often near water, and the reeds mentioned here also suggest a wetland environment, perhaps the bank of a river. We see these characteristics of the plant in its other appearances in the <em>Iliad</em>: Achilles leans his spear against a tamarisk before he leaps into the Xanthos river to kill the Trojans he has forced into it (<em>Iliad</em> 21.18) and later, when Hephaistos sets the corpses in the river on fire, tamarisks are among the plants listed as burning along the river (<em>Iliad</em> 21.350). The denseness of the plant is seen at <em>Iliad</em> 6.39, when the horses of Adrestos become tangled in a tamarisk and his chariot is broken, setting the horses loose. We have seen that a woody or marshy area—that is, one filled with plants—is often chosen for an ambush (see “The Poetics of Ambush”), and the tamarisk itself may also have a particular association with ambush. In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em>, the god, who is called “a robber, driver of cattle” (ληϊστῆρ’, ἐλατῆρα βοῶν, <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 14) and “a spy at night” (νυκτὸς ὀπωπητῆρα, Homeric Hymn to Hermes 15), among other epithets, is himself associated with the night and the ambush theme, as we also see in his role in guiding Priam during Priam’s infiltration of the Achaean camp in <em>Iliad</em> 24 (see “The Poetics of Ambush” and above on 10.1ff. for fuller discussion). According to the hymn, on the evening of the day he is born, Hermes steals the cattle of Apollo (see “The Poetics of Ambush” also for how cattle rustling is part of the larger ambush theme). When Hermes is driving these cattle at night, he stops and makes himself sandals, weaving together tamarisk and myrtle branches (συμμίσγων μυρίκας καὶ μυρσινοειδέας ὄζους, <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 81). Odysseus ties together tamarisk and reeds here in another kind of weaving of this plant, accompanying another night ambush. Schnapp-Gourbeillon (1981:115) suggests that this plant has religious associations (see also Wathelet 1989:221n35).</p>

# Iliad 10.471-475

<p>The sleeping arrangements of the Thracians seem quite orderly from this description, even though they are exhausted before falling asleep (see also the following note). One implication of this orderliness seems to be that the only arrangement not made was setting up a guard, and this lack results in their being vulnerable to ambush. Within the Achaean camp, the sleeping arrangements of Nestor (10.74–79) and Diomedes (10.150–156) are similarly detailed, suggesting that such descriptions are part of the night ambush theme. We see that the details of the scene are appropriate to each hero or group, similar to the way arming scenes are adapted for each hero. </p>

# Iliad 10.471

<p>οἱ δ᾽ εὗδον καμάτῳ ἁδηκότες</p><p>See note on 10.98 for more on καμάτῳ ἀδηκότες. There, we saw that this formula is especially connected to night themes, and that the weariness can be from either fighting all day or traveling, as we saw in the example from <em>Odyssey</em> 12. Since we are dealing here with a version of the Rhesos myth in which he has not yet fought at Troy—Dolon has to tell Diomedes and Odysseus of his presence since he is “newly arrived” (10.434)— the formula seems to be used for their deep sleep after traveling that day to Troy. For more on the versions of the Rhesos myth in which he fought for one day at Troy, see the Rhesos section of our essay “Tradition and Reception.”   </p>

# Iliad 10.482

<p>τῷ δ᾽ ἔμπνευσε μένος γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη</p><p>Athena breathes <em>menos</em> ‘force’ into Diomedes as he starts the slaughter. A similar expression is used for Apollo breathing <em>menos</em> into Hektor so that he may return to battle (ὣς εἰπὼν ἔμπνευσε μένος μέγα ποιμένι λαῶν, <em>Iliad</em> 15.262; Apollo does so at Zeus’ suggestion, see <em>Iliad</em> 15.60), and he does the same for Aeneas later (<em>Iliad</em> 20.110). We also see a connection between <em>menos</em> and breathing at <em>Iliad</em> 3.8, where the Achaeans breathe <em>menos</em> as they enter battle. During Diomedes’ <em>aristeia</em> in the <em>polemos</em>, Athena tells him that she has put <em>menos</em> into his chest, the kind of <em>menos</em> his father used to have (<em>Iliad</em> 5.124–126). Thus this “inspiration” happens between gods and their favorites, and we find in this episode in Book 10 a pattern of opposition between Athena and Apollo (we can compare their direct rivalry in <em>Iliad</em> 7). In the <em>Rhesos,</em> Athena uses speech instead to incite ambush, as she prompts Diomedes and Odysseus to attack Rhesos and the Thracians though they are ready to turn back to their own camp (<em>Rhesos</em> 594–625; see also Fantuzzi 2006b:163–170).  </p>

# Iliad 10.485-488

<p>This compressed lion simile describing Diomedes’ slaughter of the Thracians calls our attention to the lion similes elsewhere in the <em>Iliad</em> that happen explicitly at night. The shepherdless flocks in this simile correspond well to the Thracians who sleep unguarded, and the absence of a shepherd suggests that, like Diomedes, the lion is attacking at night. To support this argument, we can compare the slightly longer simile at <em>Iliad</em> 15.323–326, where the attackers also find the herds or flocks unguarded: </p><p>οἳ δ’ ὥς τ’ ἠὲ βοῶν ἀγέλην ἢ πῶϋ μέγ’ οἰῶν</p><p>θῆρε δύω κλονέωσι μελαίνης νυκτὸς ἀμολγῷ</p><p>ἐλθόντ’ ἐξαπίνης σημάντορος οὐ παρεόντος,</p><p>ὣς ἐφόβηθεν Ἀχαιοὶ ἀνάλκιδες·</p><p>They, like a herd of cattle or large flock of sheep</p><p>that two wild beasts in the dead of dark night drive to confusion</p><p>when they come suddenly and no herdsman is present,</p><p>just so the Achaeans, with no battle resolve, were routed.</p><p>In this simile, two wild beasts, which Lonsdale (1990:66, 131) identifies as lions, attack. Important details here include the time, the dead of night, and the lack of a shepherd, just as in 10.485. The sudden appearance of the lions (ἐλθόντ’ ἐξαπίνης) is likewise similar to ambush language, in which the attacker appears out of the darkness or his hiding place to surprise his victims (compare 10.496–497 below for how the poetic language represents such a sudden appearance of an ambusher). Because this simile has so much in common with the one at 10.485–488, we can draw the inference that the simile of Diomedes’ attack is also imagined to be happening in the dead of night, but that compression has left that detail implicit. We can compare also <em>Iliad</em> 12.299–308, where Sarpedon is compared to a lion trying to get inside the πυκινὸν δόμον (<em>Iliad</em> 12.301) of the sheep—that attack is also likely to be taking place at night, when the sheep are in their pen. See 10.5–9 for more on the relation of the adjective <em>pukinos</em> to the ambush theme. The lion attacks because he is hungry, but also because his audacious spirit bids him to: κέλεται δέ ἑ θυμὸς ἀγήνωρ, <em>Iliad</em> 12.300. Compare the “audacious spirit” that motivates both Diomedes (10.220) and Dolon (10.319) to undertake the spying missions.</p><p>We see lions attacking flocks explicitly at night in still other similes, such as at <em>Iliad</em> 11.172–178, where the Trojans are compared to cattle when a lion has panicked the whole herd. In that simile, similar to <em>Iliad</em> 15.324, the time, the dead of night, is indicated by the phrase ἐν νυκτὸς ἀμολγῷ (<em>Iliad</em> 11.173; see also Tsagalis 2008:153–187 for more on this phrase and what he sees as its Indo-European imagery, connected to cattle, the sun, and danger), and the fear and confusion of the herd animals is a central feature (ἐφόβησε, <em>Iliad</em> 11.173), while death comes to one in particular (<em>Iliad</em> 11.174–176). This fear and confusion is replayed on the battlefield as Agamemnon routs the Trojans, but the simile itself has the feeling of an ambush. Lonsdale (1990:118–122) has also argued that lion and cattle similes like this one adapt the epic theme of the cattle raid. See “The Poetics of Ambush” for the cattle raid as part of the ambush theme.</p><p>In two of the similes of lions attacking at night, similes that share much of the same formulaic language, the lion is unsuccessful because of the watchfulness of the men and dogs who guard them (<em>Iliad</em> 11.546–557 and <em>Iliad</em> 17.655–666). In these examples, we see that they must keep watch all night long (πάννυχοι ἐγρήσσοντες, <em>Iliad</em> 11.551 and <em>Iliad</em> 17.660), and it is only at dawn that the lion finally withdraws (<em>Iliad</em> 11.555 and <em>Iliad</em> 17.664). These lions, who go away empty-handed, provide a contrast to what we see depicted at 10.485–488, where the lack of a shepherd watching the herd enables the lion to successfully attack: in the simile world, a steadfast night watch can counteract ambush tactics. We can also hearken back to the watchdog simile at 10.180–189 and see that comparison as an indication both that the wakeful and watchful Achaean guard is indeed the kind needed on this dangerous night and that it is a mistake on the part of the Thracians to fall asleep without a guard to watch over them. Lion similes, so common in the narration of fighting in the <em>polemos</em>, also have affinities with the ambush theme, and a lion attacking at night should especially be seen in this light. That lion similes work for both themes can also be taken as another indication that the two types of warfare are not diametrically opposed, just as we have seen warriors such as Diomedes himself, but also Achilles, who excel at both. See also Schnapp-Gourbeillon 1981:104–131 for her extended discussion of Diomedes the lion in <em>Iliad</em> 10.</p>

# Iliad 10.495

<p>τρισκαιδέκατον</p><p>The number thirteen seems to be almost a “round number” or to have a completing or capping aspect to it in Homeric diction. Just as the most important victim, Rhesos, is thirteenth, Alkinoos counts himself as the thirteenth <em>basileus</em> among the Phaeacians (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.390–391). Similarly, when Odysseus chooses men for the mission to investigate further the land of the Cyclopes, he chooses twelve, counting himself as thirteenth, although the number itself is not cited there (<em>Odyssey</em> 9.195–196). Thirteen also seems to round off or cap lengths of time, such as the thirteen months that Ares is held bound in chains by Otos and Ephialtes before Hermes rescues and frees him (<em>Iliad</em> 5.387). It is on the thirteenth day that Odysseus and his crew leave Crete after being trapped there by a north wind (<em>Odyssey</em> 19.202). When Odysseus recounts to Laertes the gardens his father had promised him as a young man (as part of proving his identity to him), the numbers are all what we would consider round (ten apple trees, forty fig trees, fifty vines), but also include thirteen pear trees (<em>Odyssey</em> 24.340). Perhaps the completing aspect is related to the lunar calendar, the year coming round in the thirteenth moon. Germain (1954:10) includes thirteen among numbers that are “presque fantomatiques.”   </p>

# Iliad 10.497

<p>διὰ μῆτιν Ἀθήνης  </p><p>This phrase has been considered problematic by ancient and modern critics alike. A comment in the Venetus A scholia objects that the ambush of Rhesos is happening through the information given by Dolon rather than Athena’s plan. Fenik (1964:52–54) argues that these words “suit perfectly well the non-Iliadic versions” of events, those suggested by the scholia on 10.435 (see our commentary on that line) and that seen in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>, in which Athena has a more direct role in instigating the attack on Rhesos. We have seen, however, both that <em>mētis</em> is thematically central to ambush (see commentary on 10.19 and “The Poetics of Ambush”) and that Athena is associated with ambush tactics (see commentary on 10.460–464). Thus this phrase can be understood not literally but thematically. That is, the very fact that this is an ambush accounts for how Diomedes stands over Rhesos “through the scheme of Athena.” It need not be explained by means of another version in which Athena directly sent the Achaeans against Rhesos, even though we know such versions existed at some point in the tradition. </p>

# Iliad 10.497

<p>This line was omitted by Zenodotus and Aristophanes, according to the A scholia, and athetized (but therefore included) by Aristarchus. Papyri such as p425 and the medieval manuscript tradition do include it. Objections have been made to the accusative τὴν νύκτ’, which would more often mean ‘all night long’ than ‘on that night’, as the sense seems to demand. Indeed, according to Allen, the tenth-century Laurentian manuscript (D) has τῇ νύκτ’, seemingly correcting the problem. But Fenik finds another parallel and concludes that the accusative can have the sense of “time when” (Fenik 1964:49). What has been less well understood is the equation this line makes between Diomedes and the bad dream standing at the head of Rhesos. We discuss this use of language in detail in our essay “The Poetics of Ambush” (pp. 68–69). In brief, the syntax has Homeric parallels in other ambush situations and seems to replicate the emergence of an ambusher in the dark. As Fenik (1964:51–52) has argued, with the parallel of the charioteer’s nightmare in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>, a dream may have been part of the Rhesos tradition, and we may have a very compressed allusion to it in 10.496. That dream, alluded to, then becomes reality in the figure of Diomedes.</p>

<p>Diomedes specifically chooses Odysseus as his ambush partner for his <em>noos</em>, his ability to perceive important things (see commentary on 10.224–226 and 10.247), and we have seen that Odysseus does just that earlier in the episode, when he is the first to notice Dolon (see commentary on 10.339). So why does he not notice the whip, which seems to be apparent (φαεινήν)? Is this detail an indication that Odysseus simply ignored the chariot altogether (see below on 10.503 and 10.513–514)? Does it reflect the hurried nature of the ambush attack: even a perceptive warrior like Odysseus may simply use what is nearest at hand? Or does the theme call for an employment of the bow he brought on the mission? (On the bow and the connection between archery and the ambush theme, see “The Poetics of Ambush.”) It is difficult to know if any or all of these possible factors lie behind this detail because we have such limited evidence for the ambush theme, but it does create a vivid visual image of the “getaway” that begins here. </p>

# Iliad 10.502

<p>ῥοίζησεν </p><p>The A scholia explain that this verb means to “make a nonverbal sound, which we call συρίζειν,” a verb that means to whistle or hiss. Compare the related noun at <em>Odyssey</em> 9.315: πολλῇ δὲ ῥοίζῳ πρὸς ὄρος τρέπε πίονα μῆλα (“With much whistling (?), he [the Cyclops] was turning his fat flocks to the mountain”). At Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 835, ῥοιζέω is used of the monstrous Typhoeus, and because this monster has snakes as part of his body, ῥοιζέω is generally assumed to mean ‘hiss’. Both this verb and that to which the scholia compare it seem to include both meanings, and we can understand both as sounds the mouth makes by moving air through the teeth and/or lips. So whichever sound we imagine Odysseus making here, the key for the poetics of ambush is that it is a single, quiet, nonverbal sound, lest the other sleeping Thracians awaken before he and Diomedes make their getaway. </p>

# Iliad 10.503

<p>κύντατον</p><p>This superlative adjective is found only here in the Homeric epics, but we should note that thirty manuscripts, according to Allen, have the comparative κύντερον instead, as does p425. Other uses of the comparative in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> describe situations of suffering loss and perhaps also attempting to avenge it: it is used of Hera when she wants to defy Zeus and help the Achaeans in the war (<em>Iliad</em> 8.483); of Clytemnestra, who kills her husband Agamemnon and avenges her daughter’s death (<em>Odyssey</em> 11.427); of the insistence of a hungry belly, overriding all other concerns (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.216); and of the day that the Cyclops eats Odysseus’ men (<em>Odyssey</em> 20.18). We can also compare its uses in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter,</em> where the year during which Demeter is withdrawn is called κύντατον (<em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 306) and her grief is κύντερον (<em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 90). With this underlying notion of loss and grief connected to possible revenge as part of the traditional resonance of the word, in this line it may possibly allude to the version of the story of Rhesos in which he fights at Troy for one day and inflicts such huge damages on the Achaeans that Diomedes and Odysseus are sent to assassinate him at night (see “Tradition and Reception” for a full discussion of the variations of his story). Considering that version, Diomedes’ actions and his thoughts about further actions could be understood as fueled by grief over the loss of his comrades and as amounting to vengeance for them. The “need” on this night for action is similarly motivated by the Achaean losses earlier that day.  </p>

<p>μερμήριξε</p><p>A type scene in which two options are pondered appears numerous times in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, and this verb is a signal of that traditional scene (see also Arend 1933:106–115 for this type scene). Some of these type scenes involve ambush, as here: Odysseus ponders several times how to ambush and slaughter the suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.237, 16.256, 16.261, 19.2 = 19.52, 20.10, 20.28, 20.38, 20.41), while Phemios ponders during that ambush whether to try to escape or to supplicate Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.333). Aegisthus is also “pondering hideous things” (ἀεικέα μερμηρίζων, <em>Odyssey</em> 4.533) when he plans his ambush of Agamemnon. In addition, although these episodes are not strictly ambush themes, we find such “pondering” involved prior to plans to deceive, such as Zeus’ sending the deceptive dream to Agamemnon (<em>Iliad</em> 2.3), Hera’s seduction of Zeus (<em>Iliad</em> 14.159), Penelope’s “trick” (<em>dolos</em>) against the suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 2.93, <em>Odyssey</em> 24.128), and Odysseus’ deception of his father about his identity (<em>Odyssey</em> 24.235).   </p>

<p>Vermeule notes that these lines had at one time been taken as evidence of the “lateness” of the Doloneia, but that Spruytte’s (1977) reconstruction of a Bronze Age chariot shows that it could indeed “be lifted by any healthy man, and conventional thinking on the <em>Doloneia</em> must be rethought, with hundreds of other conventions” (Vermuele 1986:83). See also Littauer and Crouwel 1983 on Bronze Age chariots. If Diomedes does choose to take the chariot, whether by the pole or by picking it up, he presumably does so in order to move it to where Odysseus has led the horses so they can tie the horses to the chariot for the getaway (see also below on 10.513–514). But such a supposition makes it seem as though Odysseus, at least, did not take the chariot when he took the horses from where they had been tied to it (facing it, it seems, rather than in a position to pull it, at 10.475, or else why untie them?). </p>

<p>ἕως ὃ ταῦθ᾽ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα, τόφρα δ᾽ Ἀθήνη</p><p>This line is formulaically similar to the first four feet of <em>Iliad</em> 1.193 and the last two feet of <em>Iliad</em> 1.194 (ἧος ὃ ταῦθ’ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, / ἕλκετο δ’ ἐκ κολεοῖο μέγα ξίφος, ἦλθε δ’ Ἀθήνη) and thus may be considered a slightly more compressed version of Athena’s appearance to a hero who is deciding on a course of action. This is a more specific form of the type scene of “pondering options” (see 10.503) and scenes in which a decision must be made between two options, of which there are several examples in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. We can compare also <em>Iliad</em> 5.671 (μερμήριξε δ’ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν) where it is Odysseus who is divided and then Athena directs his <em>thumos</em>. Stagakis (1986:237–239) argues that the situation here is parallel to that in <em>Iliad</em> 1, when Athena appears to a pondering Achilles and offers an option different from the two the hero had been contemplating. Just as Athena’s suggestion to Achilles to insult Agamemnon with words (<em>Iliad</em> 1.211) is related to his previously considered option of checking his fury (<em>Iliad</em> 1.192), so also may Athena’s command to remember their <em>nostos</em> here be related to the previously considered option of taking the chariot, if we understand that Diomedes does take the chariot for their getaway. For more on Athena’s role in this ambush, see our commentary on 10.285, 10.482, and 10.497.  </p>

<p>νόστου δὴ μνῆσαι  </p><p>We have seen (in “The Poetics of Ambush” and the commentary on 10.211–212 and 10.247) that the mission Diomedes and Odysseus undertake has thematic language in common with journeys, and with homecomings in particular. Thus the word <em>nostos</em> here has a thematic significance. In order for the spying mission, now turned ambush, to be fully successful, Diomedes and Odysseus will have to get back safely to the Achaean ships, which is what Athena reminds Diomedes of here. In the <em>polemos</em>, a warrior might be mindful of his battle lust (some form of μιμνήσκω + χάρμης, <em>Iliad</em> 4.222, 8.252, 13.721–722, 15.380, 15.477, 19.148) or his furious resolve to stand his ground (μιμνήσκω + θούριδος ἀλκῆς, <em>Iliad</em> 6.112, 8.174, 11.566, 15.487, 15.734, 16.270, 17.185). But in an ambush, the ambushers must be mindful of their return to their own comrades. Not surprisingly, being mindful of one’s <em>nostos</em> is seen more often in the <em>Odyssey</em>. At <em>Odyssey</em> 3.141–142, Nestor recalls how Menelaos bid all the Achaeans to be mindful of their homecoming as they were about to leave Troy. In a different phrasing, Odysseus’ men ask him to be mindful of his fatherland (μιμνῄσκεο πατρίδος αἴης) specifically in the context of wanting to go home (ἱκέσθαι οἶκον, <em>Odyssey</em> 10.472–474). And in the closest parallel to this language, Athena goes to Sparta to remind Telemakhos of his <em>nostos</em> and to urge him to return home (νόστου ὑπομνήσουσα καὶ ὀτρυνέουσα νέεσθαι, see <em>Odyssey</em> 15.1–3).</p>

# Iliad 10.513-514

<p>One difficulty that has puzzled and divided commentators on <em>Iliad</em> 10 is the question of whether or not Odysseus and Diomedes do indeed take the chariot or whether they ride only the horses back to the Achaean camp. That ἵπποι is used in Homeric diction for both “horses” and “horses and chariot” adds to the confusion here. We have seen Odysseus untie the horses from the chariot rail and tie them together (10.498–499, see 10.475 for where the horses had been tied). We have also seen Diomedes contemplate taking the chariot (10.504–505). But did he take it? Leaf’s comment on 10.513 in his first edition (1886) says that ἵππων must mean the horses and chariot, because of the plural and because horseback riding happens only in similes, never in narrative in Homeric epic. In his reasoning, the option of killing more Thracians that Diomedes had been pondering is forbidden by Athena’s injunction to leave, and so, by default, the first option of taking the chariot has been followed. In his second edition (1900–1902), however, Leaf says that a general view of the passage leads to the conclusion that the heroes ride the horses themselves, and that this riding is “among the marks of lateness in this book.” Shewan (1911:180) notes that there is no consensus on whether they ride or drive, but argues that riding would not prove <em>Iliad</em> 10 to be late. He says that he first thought they ride the horses, but is now convinced that they drive the chariot (1911:274). He goes on to consider the phrase ἵππων ἐπεβήσετο and other details of the episode as well as arguments for and against either the riding of the horses or the taking of the chariot (1911:274–278).</p><p>These questions and disputes continue in more recent examinations of the passage. Anderson (1975), writing about chariot use in the <em>Iliad</em>, argues that Diomedes and Odysseus are riding horseback even though the poet uses formulas (like the verb ἐπιβαίνω here) that elsewhere are used for chariot driving. Because chariot driving is more common in the epics, “[t]he poet therefore had no ready-made set of formulae to describe riding when the need arose” (Anderson 1975:182). Although Odysseus seems throughout the episode to control both horses, as a driver would, Anderson cites a ninth-century Assyrian visual image that represents a warrior and attendant mounted on horses, and the attendant “seems to control both horses” (1975:183). Thus Anderson argues that the language used in this episode can be understood as horseback riding, and that horseback riding of this sort would have been known in the Bronze and early Iron Ages (1975:184), but his point is that any conclusion about either chariot driving or horseback riding in Homeric epic cannot be based on this one particular representation. Examining these same formulas, however, Stagakis (1985 and 1986) argues that they do seize the chariot and that they therefore drive the horses back. Hainsworth (1993:202–203) argues, as Anderson does, that the formulas are regularly used for chariot driving, but because the chariot is never mentioned again, we must assume that they are riding: “That we must imagine the heroes’ harnessing the horses to the chariot would imply an improbable ellipse after the detail of 498–502. Therefore the heroes do not take the chariot; they were after all in a hurry, and yoking a team of horses was not a simple operation, see 24.268–77” (Hainsworth 1993:203).</p><p>The intense scrutiny to which these phrases have been subjected, as well as the changes in interpretation by individual scholars, demonstrates just how intractable the question of whether or not they take the chariot is. Although we cannot necessarily resolve the question by considering it within the theme of ambush, we can note that a cattle-rustling or horse-stealing theme, such as we see at <em>Iliad</em> 11.669–684, seems to involve taking the animals alone. Because the themes of ambush and horse-stealing are closely related, the latter may explain the emphasis on the horses alone (so too might the traditional importance of Rhesos’ horses, see commentary on 10.436–437), even if the chariot is imagined to be taken. If they do ride, not drive, then that fact, as Shewan and Anderson have argued, would not be a sign of the “lateness” of composition. Rather, riding may instead be a signal of the horse-stealing theme, seen elsewhere in the <em>Iliad</em> only in Nestor’s reminiscences.</p>

# Iliad 10.515

<p>οὐδ᾽ ἀλαοσκοπιὴν εἶχ </p><p>This phrase is used not of a human guard or spy, but always of a god in our texts. In addition to Apollo here, it is used of Poseidon twice (<em>Iliad</em> 13.10 and 14.135), with different epithets completing the line, as he watches the battle so that he may help the Achaeans. In the <em>Odyssey</em> it is used of Ares, who (in the story sung by Demodokos) watches to see when Hephaistos leaves so that he can be with Aphrodite—but he then falls into Hephaistos’ trap. We can also compare the use of this formula at Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 466, where Kronos keeps a close watch on Rhea so that he can swallow their children as soon as they are born. These last two stories have affinities with the ambush theme, and we can note that, in the cases of both Ares and Kronos, they are the ones who eventually become the victims of an ambush. Those examples may help us to understand the use of the formula with Apollo here, since at first glance it seems odd that he is characterized as not keeping a negligent watch when the Thracians have just been slaughtered. We can also perhaps understand it better by comparing it to Poseidon’s role in helping the Achaeans while they are losing badly: his watch comprises seeing what disaster is befalling them (and then helping them), not preventing it entirely.</p>

# Iliad 10.518-522

<p>The moment of initial discovery and reaction by Hippokoon is quite compressed. A contrast is provided by the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em>, in which Rhesos’ charioteer delivers a messenger speech about the murder of Rhesos, and after his confrontation with Hektor, the divine mother of Rhesos appears to perform a lament for him. (See our essay “Tradition and Reception” for more on the portrayal of Rhesos and his death in the tragedy.) Here, Hippokoon is both the one to realize that Rhesos is dead and the one to perform a lament, although that lament is compressed into only one line (see also below on 10.522). The implication of this compression, however, is that an expanded version could be possible in performance (see also our commentary on 10.317 for more on the compression of lament in the <em>Iliad</em>). The particular version of the story that <em>Iliad</em> 10 presents de-emphasizes Rhesos and his traditional significance for the Trojan War. Petegorsky (1982) explores ways in which this de-emphasis is itself significant for the <em>Iliad</em>’s focus on Achilles and its portrayal of his return as necessary to save the Achaeans. This episode as presented here highlights instead the Achaean success in ambush, while only referring briefly to the loss and grief of their victims.</p>

<p>ᾤμωξέν τ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔπειτα φίλον τ᾽ ὀνόμηνεν ἑταῖρον</p><p>The scholia in the Venetus A indicate that Zenodotus’ edition had this line following 10.519 and preceding 10.520. It is not clear from the comment whether that order represents his own editorial choice or whether he knew witnesses that recorded that arrangement. Fenik (1964:54–55) notes that this same formula is used at <em>Iliad</em> 23.178 and <em>Iliad</em> 24.591, both in cases of Achilles lamenting Patroklos. Fenik observes that, in those two cases, the formula acts as a speech introduction formula “followed by an actual address and lament” (Fenik 1964:55). He interprets what he considers the “clumsily abbreviated reference” here as an indication of an expanded version elsewhere. But the very “referential character” that Fenik ascribes to this line would mean that it would not need to be expanded to have meaning for a traditional audience. If the formula had a special resonance with the death of Patroklos or lamentation in general, its use here would add to the significance of what Diomedes and Odysseus have done. Thus we can consider this a simple compression, rather than a bungling of the traditional formula.  </p>

# Iliad 10.524

<p>μέρμερα ἔργα  </p><p>For this phrase, see also 10.47–48 and 10.289–290. The awakened Trojans wonder at the astounding deeds. They are astounding because a night raid is unexpected, perhaps, but in Homeric diction this phrase is used for the slaughter of many by one man: see <em>Iliad</em> 8.453, 10.48, 11.502, 21.217. In 10.48, the emphasis is on <em>one</em> man devising astounding deeds; here the Trojans assume that more than one must have been involved, but we the audience know that it is just two. And as we saw at 10.289, this phrase is useful for both daytime battles and for ambush, as it is used here. The references at 10.48 and <em>Iliad</em> 11.502 refer to Hektor’s deeds, and at <em>Iliad</em> 21.217 to Achilles’, attesting to the “heroic” quality of the astounding deeds. At <em>Iliad</em> 11.502 and 21.217, the same verb is used as here, ῥέζω. Some commentators have questioned the value of Diomedes’ and Odysseus’ activities on the night raid, especially since the danger inherent in the presence of Rhesos is not emphasized in this version. For example, Fenik sums up his feelings about <em>Iliad</em> 10 this way: “A marked inferiority in technique here cannot possibly be interpreted away, even with the best of will. There is no good reason for the patrol, it performs no function whatever, it brings no change or development in the situation” (Fenik 1964:40). By understanding the traditional resonance of the phrase <em>mermera erga</em>, however, we can see that the Trojans react to what has happened as a disaster. This reaction may imply the same importance of Rhesos as we see in other versions of his traditional narrative (for more on those, see the Rhesos section in our essay “Tradition and Reception”)—in one version, he is the one committing <em>mermera erga</em> and has to be stopped; in another, he would have been invincible and so would have committed <em>mermera erga</em> had he lived.</p>

# Iliad 10.531

<p>The Venetus A manuscript, like many others—including some of the oldest, such as the Venetus B and the Townley manuscripts—does not include the line that is canonically called 10.531: νῆας ἔπι γλαφυράς· τῇ γὰρ φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ (“toward the hollow ships; for this way was dear to them in their hearts”). According to Allen, thirty of the one hundred eighteen manuscripts he collated do not include this line. At <em>Iliad</em> 11.519–520, we see the same pair of lines that some manuscripts record as 10.530–531: in that context, it is Nestor and Machaon who depart the fierce battle after Machaon is wounded by the arrow of Paris. The presence of this line in some witnesses to <em>Iliad</em> 10 should caution us about overinterpreting the formula in either context. It is tempting in <em>Iliad</em> 11 to see the horses’ desire to go a certain way as relating to their desire to leave battle, or that heading toward the ships, toward home, is what makes the direction dear to their hearts. But in the context of <em>Iliad</em> 10, those same interpretations cannot apply to Rhesos’ horses, which have just arrived at Troy and are now under the control of new drivers or masters. Instead, we can understand it in both places, in conjunction with the horses “flew not unwillingly” (τὼ δ᾽ οὐκ ἀέκοντε πετέσθην), as a formula dealing with horses who are whipped and then respond by moving quickly in a particular direction.</p>

Visual evidence had not yet been present during Nestor’s speech; he instead only heard the hoofbeats and tried to interpret them—as we have seen, in the poetics of night action, hearing precedes seeing. Although this ἄρα is not in a direct speech of a character, the action happens during Nestor’s speech: “He had not yet spoken every word when, look! they came.” ἄρ(α) marks the point at which Diomedes and Odysseus become visible, and thus their success in returning to the camp is confirmed.

# Iliad 10.542

<p>δεξιῇ ἠσπάζοντο ἔπεσσί τε μειλιχίοισι  </p><p>From the three uses of the verb ἀσπάζομαι in the <em>Odyssey</em>, we can see that it is used in contexts of welcoming someone who has just arrived after a journey. Nestor and the Pylians greet Telemakhos upon his arrival in Pylos (<em>Odyssey</em> 3.39), Autolykos welcomes his grandson Odysseus after he arrives for a visit (<em>Odyssey</em> 19.415: the whole line is very similar, χερσίν τ’ ἠσπάζοντο ἔπεσσί τε μειλιχίοισι), and the slave women welcome Odysseus home after Eurykleia has told them of his arrival (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.498). Thus its use here is one more indication that spying missions and ambushes share the traditional thematic language also used for journeys in these epics, and we can understand such “Odyssean” language as related to the theme, rather than any indication of “lateness.”</p><p>See above on 10.288 for more on the meaning of μειλίχιος. On that line, it is used to describe a <em>muthos</em>, and here it is used with <em>epos</em>. Although we may translate both words as ‘word’, Richard Martin has demonstrated that there are important distinctions between the terms in Homeric diction: <em>epos</em> is the unmarked term for “utterance,” while <em>muthos</em> is the marked term for a public speech-act, a “performance” of sorts that conveys authority and power (1989:22–30). When we compare the different contexts of the adjective μειλίχιος in these lines, then, we can observe that Tydeus’ <em>muthos</em> was indeed a public, performative speech in which he was at least trying to exert his authority, whereas these words of welcome carry none of those connotations. Martin also notes that “a <em>muthos</em> focuses on what the speaker says and how he or she says it, but epos consistently applies to what the addressee hears” (1989:16). Thus words of welcome are appropriately <em>epea</em>, since they are particularly heard as such by the addressee.</p>

<p>These lines use the same formulas as <em>Iliad</em> 9.672–673, although there it is Agamemnon (instead of Nestor) asking Odysseus what Achilles’ answer was to the embassy’s request that he return to battle. As we discussed in our essay “Interpreting <em>Iliad</em> 10,” a singer could have composed these two episodes paratactically (with both episodes occurring during the course of the same night), as they appear in our <em>Iliad</em>, or they may have been performance alternatives of each other. The contrast between them is that while the embassy fails, Nestor treats this return as a resounding success, regardless of the insistence of some modern critics that Diomedes and Odysseus have not fulfilled their mission (see 10.406–411 for our discussion of whether Odysseus gets the information that Nestor suggested for the spying mission). Petegorsky (1982:175–254) argues that the Doloneia responds directly to the embassy’s failure, and especially to Achilles’ challenge that the Achaeans find some better <em>mētis</em> (<em>Iliad</em> 9.423).</p>

<p>Nestor’s greeting focuses on the horses with which Odysseus and Diomedes return. His statement that he has been active in battle but has never seen horses like these is particularly appropriate to the version of Rhesos’ story presented here, in which Rhesos and his Thracians arrive that night but have not yet entered battle. (See our essay “Tradition and Reception” for a full discussion of the Rhesos tradition.) Odysseus’ response describing the horses as “newly arrived” (νεήλυδες, 10.558), which is the same adjective that Dolon uses to describe the Thracians at 10.434, similarly reinforces this version of events. Petegorsky (1982:205–206) has interpreted Nestor’s suggestion that the horses were given to them by a god (10.546, 551–553), along with Odysseus’ rejoinder that a god could give much better horses (10.556–557), as an allusion to the horses of Achilles, which were indeed a gift from the gods. This allusion, according to Petegorsky, shows how the success of the night raid as evidenced by the capture of the horses is “oddly concessive to Achilles” (Petegorsky 1982:206).</p>

But on a deeper level, the important concept of <em>nostos</em> in the ambush theme (that is, the importance of the return of the ambushers) is also connected to sun imagery (see Frame 1978/2005 and 2009 for the connection between <em>nostos</em> and the rising, or return, of the sun). The conversation between Odysseus, the hero who achieves <em>nostos</em> (see also on 10.247), and Nestor, whose name, according to Frame, reflects an earlier function of “he who brings back to life and light” (Frame 1978/2005:96–115), thus connects the horses, which look like the sun that will soon rise, and the safe return of Odysseus and Diomedes, marking the success of their night mission. We may compare the moment at which Odysseus reaches Ithaca in <em>Odyssey</em> 13.93–95: at that moment, twenty years in the making, the sun rises just as the ship draws near to land.   </p>

That solidarity among the whole group is made explicit in the next line as they cross back together, exulting in what Diomedes and Odysseus have accomplished.

<p>καγχαλόων</p><p>See above on 10.400, where Odysseus smiles, for our discussion of how to understand facial expressions within their cultural context as well as their formulaic and episodic contexts. Those same caveats apply to Odysseus’ laughter in this line, since laughter is another kind of nonverbal expression that has specific meaning within a culture. Some studies of laughter in Homer take their starting point from the suitors in the <em>Odyssey</em>, since their laughter is so memorable, but such an approach suggests the conclusion that laughter is negative in Homeric epic. Levine (1982) argues that laughter in the Homeric epics “generally implies a real or imagined physical or moral superiority over another person” (Levine 1982:97). As he strives to make that one idea fit every instance, the natural variety we would expect of different kinds of laughter in different situations is lost. He does not distinguish between the words καγχαλάω and γελάω or γελώς in his list of examples of laughter from the <em>Iliad</em> (Levine 1982:97). Colakis (1986) argues that laughter in the <em>Odyssey</em> “usually indicates some sort of weakness of character” (Colakis 1986:137). (The fact that Paris laughs on more than one occasion in the <em>Iliad</em> may contribute to this kind of interpretation.) Although she does not cite Levine 1982 on this argument, Colakis also asserts that smiles mean an actual superiority, a control of the situation, while those who laugh only think they are superior (Colakis 1986:139).</p><p>Such interpretations of laughter do not get us too far in this case: certainly Odysseus could be expressing his superior position after he reports the victory that he and Diomedes have achieved. But he could also be expressing relief at having made it back and/or showing social solidarity with the other Achaeans who here, as earlier, exult (χαίρω on this line and on 10.539). We need to be careful about how we interpret such culturally specific nonverbal communication, and not base our conclusions on the meanings of laughter in our own culture or on our personal feelings about the characters who laugh. For insightful approaches to and examinations of laughter in ancient Greek culture, including in the Homeric epics, see Halliwell 1991 and 2008. Halliwell recognizes the broad range of laughter in these epics, maintaining that “it would be misguided to claim a univocal significance for ‘Homeric’ laughter” (Halliwell 2008:97). Instead, he argues that “Homeric laughter spans a spectrum of feeling that includes both positive and negative emotions” (Halliwell 2008:53). So we must still pay close attetion to the uses of this particular verb in context in order to understand what its connotations for the ancient audience may have been.</p><p>When we do look at other uses of this same verb, we find that it is used in situations of ridicule (such as when Hektor imagines that the Achaeans are laughing at the idea of Paris as the Trojans’ best fighter, <em>Iliad</em> 3.43) or perhaps excessive celebration in triumphing over an enemy (Eurykleia laughs this way in <em>Odyssey</em> 23.1 and is warned against such laughter by Penelope at <em>Odyssey</em> 23.59). Halliwell (2008:57n15) notes that the verb καγχαλάω is later associated with animal noises, including a horse’s neigh, so here we might wonder whether it emphasizes the particular sound Odysseus makes while perhaps evoking the horses he is leading.</p><p>In terms of composition, though, the closest parallel comes from <em>Iliad</em> 6.514, which describes Paris returning to battle:</p><p>ὣς υἱὸς Πριάμοιο Πάρις κατὰ Περγάμου ἄκρης</p><p>τεύχεσι παμφαίνων ὥς τ᾽ ἠλέκτωρ ἐβεβήκει</p><p>καγχαλόων, ταχέες δὲ πόδες φέρον·</p><p><em>Iliad</em> 6.512–514</p><p>Just so the son of Priam, Paris, down from the height of Pergamon,</p><p>all shining in his armor like the sun, had gone,</p><p>laughing, and his swift feet were carrying him.</p><p>In this passage, too, we have the participle accompanying a verb of motion and enjambed as the first word of the following line. What is Paris feeling as he makes his way out of the city that makes him laugh? This passage follows the simile that compares Paris to a running horse that has broken free. (That simile is remarkable because it is repeated: compare <em>Iliad</em> 6.506–511 and <em>Iliad</em> 15.263–268, where it is used as a comparison for Hektor returning to battle.) The simile, as well as the laughter of Paris, conveys a sense of exhilaration as he moves. But the differences between the situations should caution us from making broad pronouncements about laughter and character.</p><p>The parallel between these two passages has to do with the verbs of motion and the direction of the person who laughs. Paris laughs as he moves from the safety of home, the fortified citadel of Troy, back to the plain where the battle is raging. Odysseus laughs as he moves across the ditch, from the dangers of the night to the safety offered by the ditch and the wall the Achaeans have built. They are moving in opposite directions, yet the movement itself seems to provoke the same reaction. Thus within the traditional diction this kind of laughter may accompany such a transition between safety and danger.  </p>

<p>ἀσαμίνθος appears only here in the <em>Iliad</em>, but ten times in the <em>Odyssey</em> (3.468 = 23.163, 4.48 = 17.87, 4.128, 8.450, 8.456, 10.361, 17.90, 24.370). Because it ends in –νθος, the word is generally taken to be a non-Greek word that has been adopted into the epic language (see Hainsworth 1993:210 ad 10.576 and Stanford’s [1961] commentary on the <em>Odyssey ad</em> 8.450). Hainsworth also notes that the word is attested on a seal from Knossos, and Stanford points out that earthenware bathtubs have been found at Knossos and Tiryns.</p><p>This line is the same as those found at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.48 and 17.87. The word ἀσαμίνθος is part of a formula system for getting in and out of the bathtub: eleven of its twelve appearances are part of a phrase that starts a line with ἔς ῥ’/δ’ ἀσαμίνθον/ἀσαμίνθους or ἔκ ῥ’/δ’ ἀσαμίνθου/ἀσαμίνθων and in most of these cases is followed by some form of βαίνω. So taking a bath in a bathtub is a frequent enough event in the epic tradition that this formula developed. The one exception to its line placement in the first two feet of the line is at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.128, which details the gifts that Helen and Menelaos received from Alkandre and Polybos in Egypt: Polybos gave Menelaos two silver bathtubs, among other things. Such a list of guest-gifts is, of course, a theme very different from narrating a hero getting in or out of a bath, and so it is not surprising that the formulas used are different in that case.</p><p>Getting in or out of the bath is more frequent in the <em>Odyssey</em> because it is associated with an arrival after a journey, which is a common occurrence in that epic. Telemakhos on his journey bathes at both Nestor’s palace (<em>Odyssey</em> 3.468) and at Menelaos’ (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.48, where it is both Telemakhos and Peisistratos bathing, and plurals are used as they are here). Odysseus gets in and out of the bath in the palace of Alkinoos and Arete (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.450–456) and tells of how he bathed at Circe’s once he had an oath from her for his safety (<em>Odyssey</em> 10.361). The association seen in that case between baths and safety appears many more times and is part of the poetics of the bath. Telemakhos (<em>Odyssey</em> 17.87–90), Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 23.163), and Laertes (<em>Odyssey</em> 24.370) all bathe in an ἀσαμίνθος once they return home. Telemakhos has arrived safely after the suitors’ attempted ambush, and Odysseus bathes after his slaughter of the suitors: the baths, which involve an associated vulnerability of nakedness, signal safety after danger. Laertes is not so much in danger as in a prolonged state of suffering, and this kind of recovery has parallels elsewhere in the epic. Odysseus is of course known for his suffering on his journey, and he is given his distinctive epithet πολύτλας just before his bath in Phaeacia (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.446). In <em>Odyssey</em> 17, we have seen that Telemakhos’ bath implies safety after the danger of the suitor’s planned ambush, but his guest Theoklymenos bathes in that passage as well. Theoklymenos is an exile because he killed a man of his community (Odyssey 15.271–278), so Telemakhos taking him in is a measure of safety for him, and he is called here the “long-suffering guest” (ξεῖνον ταλαπείριον, <em>Odyssey</em> 17.84), a phrase used elsewhere of Odysseus himself (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.24; compare also Odysseus as a “long-suffering suppliant” ἱκέτην ταλαπείριον at <em>Odyssey</em> 6.193 and 14.511). Bathing in an ἀσαμίνθος, then, has associations with an arrival after a journey and with getting home safely after being in danger, and marks an end to suffering.</p><p>Bathing does indeed happen in other situations in the <em>Iliad</em>, but the word used in these other situations is λοετρόν (<em>Iliad</em> 14.6, 22.444–445, 23.44) or a related word (<em>Iliad</em> 18.346). We might expect the Trojans to bathe in their own homes, and we do see Andromache’s preparations for a bath for Hektor that he will never take (<em>Iliad</em> 22.444–445). But the Achaeans have hot baths as well, as we see when Nestor tells the wounded Machaon that Hekamede will prepare a hot bath for him and wash away the blood (<em>Iliad</em> 14.6–7) and when Achilles refuses the hot bath that Agamemnon ordered be prepared for him (<em>Iliad</em> 23.39–44). (Note that Achilles has also refused to eat since Patroklos’ death: as the following lines here also make clear, there is a thematic connection between bathing and eating a meal.) The corpse of Patroklos is also washed when it is brought back from battle (<em>Iliad</em> 18.343–353). There, we see in detail the water heated in a bathwater tripod, using formulaic language seen also when a bath is prepared for Odysseus in Phaeacia (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.435–437 ≈ <em>Iliad</em> 18.346–348). Similar to the way that Diomedes and Odysseus rinse and cool off in the sea here, we also see the Achaeans ritually wash in the sea after the end of the plague (<em>Iliad</em> 1.313–314). The <em>Iliad</em> thus displays several examples of other language about washing or bathing, and the language used here is particularly associated with journeys and ambush.</p><p>In a recent article, Jonas Grethlein (2007) examines the poetics of the bath in the <em>Iliad</em>. He confines his examination to the baths in the <em>Iliad</em>, saying that others have treated the theme in the <em>Odyssey</em> as part of the “ritual of hospitality,” which does not hold for the <em>Iliad</em> (2007:25). Grethlein argues for two types of baths in the <em>Iliad</em>: that of a warrior returning from battle (and he includes this bath in <em>Iliad</em> 10 in this category) and the washing of the corpse of a dead warrior (2007:28). Then he shows how these two types of bath create narrative tensions and connections, focusing especially on the bath that Andromache prepares for Hektor (2007:28–49). Grethlein also argues that both kinds of bath share a connection with a transition: the bathing of the corpse involves the transition from life to death, and the warrior’s bath involves a transition from the danger of death in battle to a place of safety (2007:28–29). Our arguments about the bath here in <em>Iliad</em> 10, developed before Grethlein’s article appeared, agree in many ways with his. But in his separation of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, he seems to have overlooked that the arrival after a journey, beyond being simply hospitality, often in the <em>Odyssey</em> includes a similar measure of safety after danger as that which he sees in the warrior’s return from battle in the <em>Iliad</em>. And although he pays close attention to formulaic language in these types scenes, he does not mention the particular language used in this case, which differs from the other baths in the <em>Iliad</em> in particular ways.</p><p>We can now see what ἀσαμίνθους adds to this particular scene. This type of bathtub is formulaically associated with the safe arrival from a journey, and a night mission, whether spying or ambush, is thematically like a journey particularly in that it involves a return. We have seen (1) Nestor describe the spying mission as (ideally) a going out and coming back safe and sound (see 10.211–212), (2) Diomedes choose Odysseus as his partner for the mission because of his abilities to get home (10.247), and (3) Athena tell Diomedes to remember his homecoming while he lingers momentarily in the Thracian camp (10.509). As Albert Lord notes briefly regarding the bath Odysseus takes in <em>Odyssey</em> 23: “The bath belongs in the tale of the return—it surely has ritual significance” (1960:176). There is an idea of a <em>nostos</em> associated with this kind of mission, and the traditional association of a bath in a tub with a safe arrival after a journey appears in this expanded version of the spying/ambush theme.</p>

# Iliad 10.578

<p>δείπνῳ ἐφιζανέτην</p><p>An older style of criticism was concerned about the so-called “unity” of <em>Iliad</em> 9, because the members of the embassy have multiple meals within one evening (see also Shewan 1911:186–187 for a review of scholarly objections that this is Odysseus’ third meal on this night). At <em>Iliad</em> 9.65–73, Nestor advises Agamemnon to prepare and host the evening meal, and the guards for the night have their dinner at their station (<em>Iliad</em> 9.88) while the leaders eat at Agamemnon’s tent (<em>Iliad</em> 9.89–92). It is after dinner that they discuss the embassy to Achilles. Three of the leaders who must have eaten with Agamemnon, Phoinix, Ajax, and Odysseus, go on the embassy. When Achilles welcomes them, he and Patroklos immediately prepare a meal (<em>Iliad</em> 9.205–220), and it seems that all of them eat and talk only after they have finished (<em>Iliad</em> 9.221–222). We should first of all note that these two lines indicating that they eat their fill are the same formulas as <em>Iliad</em> 9.91–92, which transition from the meal preparation scene to the conversation. So meal preparation and consumption is, from the standpoint of oral poetics, a theme that is closely associated with gatherings of leaders and, as is made explicit in the advice of Nestor to Agamemnon, with the hospitality offered by those leaders. Thus it makes sense that more than one supper is prepared for these men: there is much more to it than satiating their hunger.</p><p>Once we recognize that there are multiple associations with the poetic theme of a meal, then, how should we understand Diomedes and Odysseus eating once again here? According to the A scholia, Aristarchus marked the dual form of the verb here because the meal should apply to all, not just these two, since they are having breakfast in the early morning at this point. This objection seems to apply a similar logic to that which we have already discussed, namely keeping track of which meal the men should be eating. Instead, we can look for other associations that meals have within this tradition, focusing, as the dual verb form does, on the two warriors who have just returned from a dangerous mission. As we saw with the baths at 10.576, the meal here has associations with an arrival after a journey, and the return after a spying mission or an ambush has much in common with the theme of the journey. Indeed, there seems to be a traditional sequence of bathing and then eating after such an arrival, and we see such a thematic sequence in the examples from the <em>Odyssey</em>: after the arrivals in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, 4, 8, 10, and 17, in which a bath in an ἀσαμίνθος takes place, a meal follows the bath as part of the hospitality for a guest or the arrival home. As Foley says about baths in the <em>Odyssey</em> in general, its theme is securely linked to that of the feast (Foley 1999:185, 245). Thus, the bath–meal sequence here is entirely traditional and should be expected rather than suspected.  </p>

# Iliad 11.5–16

<p>As indicated already in the comment for I.08.220–227, the ships of the Achaeans are beached along the shores of a large U-shaped bay that opens into the Hellespont. See again Map 1 and Map 2 at HPC 157 and 158 respectively. At the upper left and the upper right tips of the U-shaped bay, at the northwest and northeast, are the beached ships of Achilles and of Ajax respectively, I.11.008–009. Also at those points are the <em>klisiai</em> ‘shelters’ of these two heroes, I.11.007. As for the beached ship of Odysseus, it is located at the base of the U-shaped bay, at the south in the middle of the bayline, I.11.005–006. There will be more to say about this location in the later comments at I.11.806–808 and at I.14.027–036. To be highlighted already now, however, is a detail about the ship of Odysseus: the goddess Eris ‘Strife’, who is here the spirit of war personified, I.11.004, is shown standing on the deck of this beached ship, which is said to be located <em>en messatōi</em> ‘in the middlemost space’, I.11.006, and from here she projects her voice of divine authority, shouting mightily to all the Achaeans stationed at their own ships, I.11.005–014, and all the Achaeans stationed at all the beached ships can hear the divine voice—from the ship of Achilles at one extreme of the U-shaped bay all the way to the ship of Ajax at the other extreme, I.11.007–009. Then, Agamemnon too shouts to the Achaeans, I.11.015–016, and his royal voice is figured here as an extension of the divine voice emanating from the goddess Eris herself, I.11.005–014. Later, in the comment on I.18.587–589, there will be more to say about the <em>klisiā</em> ‘shelter’ of Achilles, mentioned here together with the <em>klisiā</em> of Ajax, I.11.007–008: it can be argued that Achilles frequents this ‘shelter’ not only as an epic hero in the time of the Trojan War but also, in post-heroic times, as a cult hero (HPC 153).  </p>

Such a moment is now at hand as Agamemnon the over-king is about to have his own moment of experiencing an ‘epic high point’. At such a moment, the Narrator must be ready to do his very best in recapturing that heroic experience. And, to express his readiness, the Narrator in all his self-awareness will now re-invoke the Muse or the Muses. In this context, the ‘I’ who is re-invoking the Muse(s) is meant to be seen as a re-enactment of ‘Homer’ himself, as originally enacted by the speaker who invokes the Muse at I.01.001 and at O.01.001.  </p>

# Iliad 11.288

<p>Here at I.11.288, Hector is boasting that Agamemnon, ‘the best man’, <em>ho aristos</em>, is now out of the picture. There is an irony built into the words of Hector, and this irony emerges from the context. The <em>aristeiā</em> ‘epic high point’ of Agamemnon in the <em>Iliad</em>, inaugurated in grand style when the Master Narrator invokes the Muses at I.11.218, does not go all that well for the high king. Early on in the fighting, he gets wounded in the hand, I.11.253. He tries to fight on, but the pain from the wound finally gets to him, I.11.268–272. The intensity of his pain is compared here to the birth-pangs experienced by a woman at the climax of her labor, I.11.269–271. Unable to withstand such pain any more, Agamemnon jumps back on the platform of his war chariot and orders his driver to drive him back to the safety of the beached ships of the Achaeans, I.11.273–274, shouting to his fellow warriors that they should now follow him in retreat and defend the ships, I.11.275–278, since, as he says, Zeus has not supported the ongoing offensive initiated by the Achaeans, I.11.278–279. So, the <em>aristeiā</em> ‘epic high point’ of Agamemnon has not exactly turned out to be a spectacular success. And Hector knows it. As the chariot of Agamemnon speeds this over-king away from the scene of battle, I.11.280–283, Hector notices, I.11.284, as expressed by the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note’. It is in this context, then, that Hector says what he says at I.11.288: ‘the best man’, <em>ho aristos</em>, is now out of the picture. But of course the truly best of all the Achaeans is not yet in the picture.  </p>

This verse-final phrase <em>īsos aellēi</em> ‘equal to a blast of wind’ (ἶσος ἀέλλῃ) matches rhythmically the verse-final phrase <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ (ἶσος Ἄρηϊ). Aside from the match in form, there is also a deep-seated match in meaning here between the phrases ‘equal to Ares’ and ‘equal to a blast of wind’, since the god of war is traditionally linked with violent winds. See the comment on I.05.430. Such a link is also attested in the cognate poetics of other Indo-European languages besides Greek: analysis in a later comment (via BA 334, 337).  </p>

<p>Diomedes and Odysseus agree to fight as a team, I.11.310–319. Diomedes throws a spear at Thumbraios, who is riding on a chariot and who gets knocked to the ground by the piercing wound, I.11.320–321. Then Odysseus symmetrically wounds with his own piercing spear-throw the charioteer of Thumbraios, Molion, who is described here as the <em>therapōn</em> of Thumbraios, I.11.322. Presumably, Molion too has been riding on the same chariot and gets knocked to the ground. Molion is not overtly called the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ of Thumbraios, but the context shows that he is exactly that, the chariot driver. And, although Molion is the <em>therapōn</em> of Thumbraios, Molion does not get to “take the hit” for Thumbraios the chariot fighter, since that fighter is hit even before his driver is hit. So we see here an unexpected variation on the theme of the <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’ as well as ‘attendant’.</p>

# Iliad 11.497-500

<p>Hector does not yet notice that Ajax is fighting on the right-hand side of the battleground since he, Hector, is at this moment fighting on the left-hand side, near the banks of the river Scamander. Although the perception is attributed to Hector here, the actual perspective is that of the Master Narrator, who consistently views the scene of chariot fighting from the Achaean point of view. In terms of this perspective, Hector is now fighting on the east side of the battleground while Ajax is fighting on the west side. The map of the battleground can be visualized on the cumulative basis of references, as here at I.11.497–500, to left-right positioning in descriptions of the fighting. What follows is an outline of the overall mapping. The Achaeans are encamped in the north and defending the Wall that separates them and their beached ships from the Trojans, who are attacking from the south. The river Scamander, flowing from the southeast toward the northwest and emptying into the Hellespont, separates Troy in the northeast from the encampment of the Achaeans in the northwest. Meanwhile, the Wall of the Achaeans separates their encampment and their ships in the northwest from the Trojans who are attacking the Wall from the south. The Achaeans built the Wall because the Trojans, emboldened by the momentum of Hector, have by now crossed over from the southeast side of the river Scamander to the southwest side, moving into the plain situated to the south of the Achaean Wall. So now this whole plain to the west of the Scamander has become a battleground for chariot fighting. Hector is fighting further to the east, staying close to the west bank of the Scamander, while Ajax is fighting further to the west.  </p>

# Iliad 11.508

<p>The idea of ‘breathing out’ something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ implies that such power was previously ‘breathed in’, that is, ‘breathed into’ the hero, by a divine force. Such a ‘breathing in’ happens for example at I.10.482: as it is pointed out in the comment on that verse, the goddess Athena is pictured there in the act of literally ‘breathing’, <em>pneîn</em>, into the hero Odysseus something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’. Here at I.11.508, the aggregate of warriors who are ‘breathing-out [<em>pneîn</em>] mental-power [<em>menos</em>]’ are the Achaeans viewed as a group; so also at I.03.008; by contrast, at I.02.536, the epithet applies to a sub-group, the Abantes.</p>

# Iliad 11.604

<p>Achilles calls out to Patroklos, who now comes out of the shelter. At this moment Patroklos is described as <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’, and the very application of this epithet here to Patroklos dooms him to die as a ritual substitute for Ares as god of war. That is why the ominous remark is added: ‘and that was the beginning of his doom’ (κακοῦ δ&#x27; ἄρα οἱ πέλεν ἀρχή). Much later, when he is finally killed, Patroklos is described as <em>atalantos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’, I.16.784. For Patroklos, however, the ritual substitution involves not only Ares who is the god of war for the generic warrior: it involves also the god Apollo as the divine antagonist of Achilles. In <em>Iliad</em> 16, the death of Patroklos as a ritual substitute will be marked not only by the epithet <em>atalantos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ at I.16.784 but also by the epithet <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a superhuman-force [<em>daimōn</em>]’ at I.16.705 and at I.16.786. This <em>daimōn</em> ‘superhuman force’ will be Apollo, the divine antagonist of Achilles.  </p>

# Iliad 11.624–11.627

<p>The references at I.09.128–131 and at I.09.270–272 to the story about the conquest of the Aeolian island of Lesbos by Achilles are complemented by the reference here at I.11.624–627 to a story about the conquest of the Aeolian island of Tenedos by the same hero. At Lesbos, Achilles is said to have captured seven unnamed Aeolian women, I.09.128–131 / I.09.270–272. At Tenedos, he is said to have captured one particular Aeolian woman named Hekamede, who was thereafter allotted as a war-prize to Nestor I.11.624–627. And why was Nestor allotted this war-prize? Because Hekamede excelled in intelligence, signaled here by way of the word <em>boulē</em>, I.11.627. On the meaning of <em>boulē</em> in the specific sense of clever ‘planning’, see the comment on I.11.627 immediately after this comment. For the moment, however, the focus of interest is not on the matching of Nestor with Hekamede in terms of their shared intelligence but rather on the degrading of Hekamede as a captive woman. In the narrative at I.11.624–627, we can see how it all happened. After Achilles conquered Tenedos and captured Hekamede, what must have happened next is that he handed her over to his fellow Achaeans, who then acted as a group in alloting her as a war-prize to Nestor. Parallel is the story of the seven unnamed Aeolian captive woman who were captured by Achilles when he conquered the Aeolian island of Lesbos, as noted in the anchor comment at I.09.128–131 / I.09.270–272: again, Achilles must have handed over these seven unnamed Aeolian captive women to his fellow Achaeans, who then acted as a group in allotting them as war-prizes to Agamemnon. Also parallel are the stories of two other Aeolian captive women, Chryseis and Briseis, who were captured by Achilles when he conquered the cities of Thēbē and Lyrnessos respectively, as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–693: yet again, Achilles must have handed over these two Aeolian captive women to his fellow Achaeans, who then acted as a group in allotting them as war-prizes—to Agamemnon in the case of Chryseis and to Achilles himself in the case of Briseis. Yet another Aeolian captive woman is of course Andromache herself, who originated from the city of Thēbē: in this case, however, as noted in the anchor comment at I.09.128–131 / I.09.270–272, she is taken captive only after Troy is conquered by the Achaeans, who allot her as war-prize to Neoptolemos, son of Achilles, as we read in the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, plot summary by Proclus p. 108 line 9 (ed. Allen 1912).  </p>

# Iliad 11.806-808

<p>Here as well as earlier at I.08.220–227 and at I.11.005–016, also later at I.14.027–036, the headquarters of the Achaeans are said to be located at the same place where the ship of Odysseus is beached, on the shores of the south end of the bay of the Hellespont. It is here, next to the beached ship of Odysseus, that the Achaeans of the <em>Iliad</em> hold their assemblies and perform their sacrifices, as we see from the wording at I.11.807–808. Such a centerpoint, then, is not only topographical: it is also political—even sacral. And it is from here that the king Agamemnon shouts his speech of royal authority, as we saw at I.08.220–227. Likewise, it is from here that the goddess Eris ‘Strife’, who is the spirit of war personified, shouts at the Achaeans with her voice of divine authority at I.11.005–014, echoed by Agamemnon’s voice of royal authority at I.11.015–016. The location of this political and sacral centerpoint is the <em>naustathmon</em> ‘ship-station’ of the Achaeans according to Strabo 13.1.31–32 C595 (quoted at HPC 153) and 13.1.36 C598 (quoted at HPC 154), who equates such a station with something called the <em>limēn</em> ‘harbor’of the Achaeans’. But such a notion of ‘harbor’ is misleading from the standpoint of the <em>Iliad</em>. As noted in the comment on I.08.220–227, the ships of the Achaeans were not floating at anchor in the bay of the Hellespont: rather, they were beached along the shores of the bay. </p>

# Iliad 12

<p>At the very beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 12, we modern readers may find that we have suddenly hit a wall—the Achaean Wall. It seems difficult for us to understand what the Master Narrator of the <em>Iliad</em> is really saying when he foretells the future destruction or deconstruction of this structure. And the main obstacle to our understanding here is not the presence of the Achaean Wall in the <em>Iliad</em> but rather its foretold absence—after all is said and done in the narrative. For the ancients who heard the Iliad narrated to them, by contrast, the future absence of the Achaean Wall was perfectly understandable <em>in terms of the narration itself</em>. And that is because the Master Narrator presupposes that there is no Achaean Wall to be seen in the Trojan landscape at the time of narration. Such a presupposition shapes the narrative of <em>Iliad</em> 12—and in fact it shapes the whole narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>. The setting for this narrative remains the world of heroes, which is larger-than-life because it is situated in the heroic past, but the setting for the actual narration of this narrative is the post-heroic world of a present time as figured by the Master Narrator himself. The staging of the heroic world by the Master Narrator is comparable to what is called the <em>mise-en-scène</em> in the traditions of French theater and film. And the predominant feature of the Iliadic <em>mise-en-scène</em> or scenery is the Achaean Wall, not the Trojan Wall. That is why the building of this structure by the Achaeans in Iliad 7 had been opposed by the gods Poseidon and Apollo, the original builders of the Trojan Wall. But the Achaean Wall needed to be built by the Achaeans to protect them and their ships from the fire of Hector—which would not be threatening them if Achilles had not been insulted by Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 1. If we think of the overall plot of the <em>Iliad</em> as a scenario, then the Achaean Wall can be seen as an integral feature of the scenery for this scenario.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RP-P-OB-16.043.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Siege of the Greek Camp.” Crispijn van de Passe (I) (1613).

tags: menos ‘mental power’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 12.018

<p>Not only heroes (and their horses) but also forces of nature—such as rivers, as here—can have <em>menos</em>. In the comments so far, <em>menos</em> has been consistently translated as ‘mental power’, not just ‘power’, and this translation can apply even in the present context, I.12.018. Forces of nature can have a mind of their own, as it were, because they are connected to the mental power of divinities who control the cosmos and to whom humans using their own mental power can pray for the activation of such control. Besides rivers, as here, other natural forces that have <em>menos</em> include the sun (I.23.190), fire (I.06.182, I.17.565), and winds (O.19.440). Like heroes, cosmic forces have to be reminded of their <em>menos</em>, and this is precisely what gets done by worshippers who use their own mental power in praying to divinities controlling such cosmic forces, as we see for example in Indic traditions centering on the word <em>mánas</em>-, which I likewise translate as ‘mental power’ and which is actually a cognate of Greek <em>menos</em>.</p>

tags: Achaean Wall, hero cult, post-heroic age, hēmitheoi ‘demigods; half-gods’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 12.023

<p>As the rivers of the Trojan landscape flood away all traces of the Achaean Wall, they also obliterate all traces of the epic battles fought by the Achaean heroes in the mise-en-scène or scenery of that landscape. These heroes are called <em>hēmitheoi</em> ‘demigods, half-gods’ here at I.12.023, and we find no other attestation of this word <em>hēmitheoi</em> in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em>: in both epics, the word for ‘heroes’ is consistently <em>hērōes</em>. Unlike <em>hēroēs</em>, the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> is appropriate to a style of expression that looks beyond epic. The use of this word to mark the Achaean heroes here belongs not to the epic tradition of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> but to alternative poetic traditions having to do with cosmogony and anthropogony, as we see when we consider the attestations of <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Hesiodic poetry, F 204.100 and <em>Works and Days</em> 160; relevant too are the attestations of this word in the poetry of the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, 31.19 and 32.19 (Nagy 2006 §66). In the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>, 160, the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> signals the last generation of heroes, who were obliterated in the time of the Theban and the Trojan Wars, 161–165, but who were preserved after death and immortalized by being transported to the Islands of the Blessed, 167–173. It can be said in general that the theme of heroic immortalization is central to myths and rituals related to hero cult, and so the use of the word <em>hēmitheoi</em> ‘demigods’ in this Hesiodic context is highly significant (<em>The Best of the Achaeans</em> 342-343): yes, all epic heroes must die, but then, by way of becoming cult heroes, they are mystically immortalized after death (Nagy 2006 §§80–108). And the significance of such a theme is further heightened by the idea of divine parentage as built into the meaning of word <em>hēmitheoi</em> as ‘half-gods’, which shows a genetic understanding of the hero. The heroic potential is programmed by divine genes, as it were. There has to be a god involved in any hero’s “family tree.” Still, the literal meaning of the word <em>hēmitheos</em> as ‘half-god’ does not imply an exact half-and-half distribution of immortals and mortals in a hero’s genealogy. Rather, this meaning marks a tenuous balancing of immortality with mortality in the hero’s self. In the case of the hero Achilles, for example, the divinity of his mother is not the only ‘half’ of immortality that he inherits, since his mortal father Peleus is descended, by way of that man’s own mortal father Aiakos, from the immortal father Zeus himself. But the bitter fact remains that Peleus is a mortal. And, since Peleus as one of the two parents of Achilles is mortal, Achilles must be mortal as well, even though his other parent is Thetis, who is not only immortal but even endowed with limitless cosmic powers (<em>The Best of the Achaeans</em> 346–347). So Achilles, despite the limitless potential he inherits from Thetis, is subject to death. The same can be said about all other Homeric heroes: even though they are all descended in some way or another from the gods, they are all mortals. They all have to die, like ordinary mortals. No matter how many immortals you find in a heroic “family tree,” the intrusion of even a single mortal will make all successive descendants mortal. Mortality, not immortality, is the dominant gene (GN 2006 §70). So, the meaning of <em>hēmitheoi</em> as ‘half-gods’ can cut both ways: the ‘half-divinity’ of the hero can point downward to the grim facts of mortality just as it can point upward to the sublime hopes for immortalization after death. The scenario of obliteration followed by immortalization for the <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Hesiodic poetry, <em>Works and Days</em> 161–173, must be contrasted with the scenario of obliteration followed by no mention of immortalization for the <em>hēmitheoi</em> in Homeric poetry, I.12.17–33. The inevitability of death for the hero enhances the pathos of hoping for immortalization after death. Such a pathos is visible in the exceptional Homeric occurrence of <em>hēmitheoi</em> at I.12.023, where we see a correspondingly exceptional shift in the Homeric narrative perspective: instead of viewing heroes through the lens of the heroic age, seeing them as they were back then, alive and hoping to be remembered, the poetry now views them through the lens of a post-heroic age, seeing them as already dead and hopefully immortalized after death (Nagy 2006 §67).</p>

# Iliad 12.118–123

<p>Reference is made at I.12.118 to the left-hand side of the encampment protecting the ships of the Achaeans. So, in terms of the Master Narrator’s perspective, the positioning refers to the east side: see the comment on I.11.497–500. Described here at I.12.118–123 is the opening in the Achaean Wall through which the charioteers drive their chariots from the Achaean encampment to the scene of chariot fighting and then back again. The use of the word <em>pulē</em> ‘gate’ in the plural at I.12.120 does not necessarily point to the existence of more than one gate, since the function of the plural <em>pulai</em> here may be elliptic: ‘the gate and related things that belong to the gate’. There is a reference to the same <em>pulai</em> at I.07.339–340 and at I.07.438–439. On the concept of an elliptic plural, see the comment on I.04.196. And it is next to this gate that the sacred common tomb of the Achaean dead is located, I.07.336–337.  </p>

# Iliad 12.188/ anchor comment on: ozos Arēos ‘attendant of Ares’

<p>As noted in the comment on I.12.130, Leonteus is the only Iliadic figure who is called ‘equal to Ares’ besides Hector, Patroklos, and Achilles (see also BA 33). Relevant is the fact that he qualifies here at I.12.188 as <em>ozos Arēos</em> ‘attendant of Ares’, also at I.02.745, I.23.841. The word <em>ozos</em> in this description, which applies also to other heroes as listed above, can be explained etymologically as *<em>(h)o-sd-os</em>, meaning ‘seated together with’: so a hero who qualifies as <em>ozos Arēos</em> ‘attendant of Ares’ can be pictured as literally ‘seated together with Ares’ (BA 295 = ch.17§5n8). The application of this epithet to a hero indicates that such a hero, as a warrior, is destined to become a ritual substitute for the war-god Ares, in the sense that generic warriors are described as <em>therapontes Arēos</em> ‘attendants of Ares’ in the <em>Iliad</em>. See the comment on I.06.067.  </p>

# Iliad 12.198/ anchor comment on: Battle for the Ships, fire of Hector, breaking through the Wall of the Achaeans

<p>In the Battle for the Ships, the objective of Hector is for the Trojans to set on fire the beached ships of the Achaeans, and, for this objective to be realized, the Trojans must break through the Wall of the Achaeans. There is a reference to such a breakthrough already at I.12.090. For further references, which occur mostly in <em>Iliad</em> 12, to the Trojan objective of breaking through the Wall, see I.12.090, I.12.223, Ι.12.257, I.12.261–262, I.12.308, I.12.418, Ι.12.440–441, I.13.679–680. Many of these references mention also the fire that threatens the beached ships of the Achaeans. From here on, further Iliadic mentions of (1) the Battle for the Ships, (2) the fire of Hector and his Trojans, and (3) the breakthrough of the Trojans in penetrating the Wall of the Achaeans will intensify. Accordingly, for practical reasons, comments on these mentions will from here on refer back only to the anchor comment as formulated here at I.12.198. </p>

We have also seen, at I.08.175–176, that the Will of Zeus as signaled by his nodding will bring <em>nīkē</em> ‘victory’ to the Trojans and <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ to the Achaeans. So too the nodding of Zeus here at I.12.236 signals once again the Will of Zeus, expressed in this case by way of the plural of <em>boulē</em>, ‘will’, which is <em>boulai</em>. This noun <em>boulē</em>, as noted already at I.01.005, I.01.524–530, I.10.043–052, I.10.415, I.11.627, also conveys the idea of ‘planning’, not just ‘wishing’.

<p>Menestheus, the leader of the Athenians who came to fight at Troy, is stationed to guard a <em>purgos</em> ‘tower’ of the Achaean Wall, I.12.332/333/373. It is at this point in the Wall that the attacking forces on the Trojan side are making their breakthrough, and so the station of Menestheus is evidently located next to the political and sacral centerpoint of the Achaeans, where the stations of Agamemnon and Odysseus are also located. On this concept of a political and sacral centerpoint, see the comments on I.11.806–808. The proximity of the Athenian leader Menestheus to such a centerpoint can be seen as a subtle reference to the importance of Athens in the transmission of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 12.433-438

<p>This simile contains the one instance of the adjective <em>alēthēs</em> in Homeric epic that is not applied directly to verbal communication, but to a person, a woman weighing wool with scales. The other instances of <em>alēthēs</em> show that it qualifies (the content of) speech, indicating that it denotes truthfulness in the sense of not forgetting what has been said in an uninterrupted continuum of time, and not letting anything slip by one without being mindful of its implications (and indeed, <em>a-lēthēs </em>and <em>a-lētheia </em>are to be understood in opposition to <em>lēthē</em>). Here, however, it can be seen to be applied by a logical extension to the agent of such communication, and so, to indicate the woman’s scrupulousness in her business transactions (so Cole).</p><p>Insofar as the simile and the wool-weighing woman illustrates the balance of the battle between the Greeks and the Trojans, there is a further dimension to her being <em>alēthēs</em>. The balance of and then the change in a battle is often represented through the image of Zeus weighing the two sides in scales (e.g. I.8.69-74, I.16.658, I.19.223-224, I.22.209-213), and this image of Zeus can be seen to be implied here, too, even if it is not explicitly presented as such: in lines 437-438 Zeus gives the upper hand to Hektor. Detienne argues that this image reflects the idea of the archaic king pronouncing justice, with which scales are likewise associated: such pronouncements of justice by the king are just and <em>alēthēs</em>. The model for this king is Zeus in his role of administering justice and judging between two sides, using his scales – and so the adjective is appropriate here, too, signaling the divine justness and <em>alētheia</em> of the judgement weighed in the scales. The application of the adjective <em>alēthēs </em>explicitly to the woman within the simile, then, presents her in the role of Zeus as a divine judge, transferring to the vehicle an attribute of the tenor. And the idea of <em>pronouncing</em> such judgements brings <em>alēthēs</em> here, too, back to the sphere of communication that excludes forgetting, ignoring, and failing to notice by its opposition to <em>lēthē</em>.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Cole, Thomas. 1983. “Archaic Truth.” <em>Quaderni Urbinati di cultura classica</em> n.s. 13:7-28.</p><p>Detienne, Marcel. 1973. <em>Les maîtres de vérité dans la Grèce archaïque</em>.

# Iliad 13.242–244

<p>Zeus, in the act of launching his thunderbolt, can be visualized simultaneously in two ways, as here. First, he can be seen as casting his thunderbolt by throwing it with his own divine hand, I.13.243. But, second, he can be seen as casting his divine eye on his target, and his angry looks will thus launch his thunderbolt from within: that is the sense of the expression at I.13.244 here, ‘and his eyes [<em>augai</em>] are most visible [<em>arizēloi</em>]’ (ἀρίζηλοι δέ οἱ αὐγαί). The noun <em>augai</em>, which means literally ‘lights’, refers here to the eyes of Zeus, as also at I.13.837. On the expression <em>the look of Zeus</em>, see the comment on I.19.003–017.  </p>

# Iliad 13.386

<p class="chsnormal">While the hero Asios is fighting <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">pezos</span></em> ‘on foot’ against the Achaeans, I.13.385, the two horses that draw his chariot are right behind him, practically breathing down his neck—that is, down his shoulders. The driver of the horses is an unnamed <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">hēni-okhos</span></em> ‘chariot driver’, who is described as the <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">therapōn </span></em>‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Asios, I.13.386. After Asios is killed, I.13.386–393, and his corpse is just lying there in front of the horses that once drew his chariot, I.13.392, the focus reverts to the <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">hēni-okhos</span></em> ‘chariot driver’, I.13.394. Still standing on the chariot platform, the chariot driver freezes, failing to turn the chariot around and drive the horse team back to safety, I.13.394–396. The Achaean hero Antilokhos takes this opportunity to spear the chariot driver, who then falls out of the chariot, and now Antilokhos can mount the empty chariot and drive it away himself, horses and all, I.13.396–401.</p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, death by Ares

# Iliad 13.444

<p>At the very moment when the hero dies here, the war-god Ares literally takes away the hero’s life or <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’. To be compared is I.05.296, where the hero’s <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ is released from his body at the moment of death. But now we see that the agent for taking away the <em>menos</em> of the hero is Ares. Thus the ultimate killer of the generic hero as warrior is Ares himself, no matter who the immediate killer may be—as in this case, where the killing is performed by the hero Idomeneus with the direct help of the god Poseidon. The role of Ares in taking away the life of the generic hero at the moment of heroic death is relevant to the epithet of heroes as generic warriors: <em>therapontes</em> or ‘ritual substitutes’ of Ares. See the comment on I.02.110.  </p>

<p>The momentum of the attacking Trojan warriors gets stalled here, since Hērā interrupts the ongoing Plan of Zeus. The goddess seduces the god, and the setting for their divine sexual encounter is the spectacular landscape of Mount Ida, which is the private abode of the thundering almighty. During the tryst of the god and the goddess, the Achaeans regain the upper hand in the fighting. But this new momentum is soon headed for a downturn. The divine interruption, despite all its cosmic sexual energy, becomes retrospectively a mere interlude in the narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>—once the tryst is over and the Plan of Zeus resumes its relentless course of action. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Carracci_-_Jupiter_et_Junon.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Juno and Jupiter.

# Iliad 14.027-036

<p>Nestor here reconnects with Agamemnon and other leaders of the Achaeans at their headquarters, I.14.027–028. The headquarters are pictured as a massing of ships beached on the shores of the south end of the bay of the Hellespont, and this location has been reconstructed in the comments on I.08.220–227, I.11.005–016, and I.11.806–808. But there is now an added detail to be noted here at I.14.030–032: the ships had been beached with their sterns facing inland and their prows facing out toward the waters, so that the Wall of the Achaeans, built ten years after the original beaching of the ships, was made to be contiguous with the sterns of the ships lined up along the southern shores of the bay of the Hellespont. See also the comment at I.15.385. As for the other ships of the Achaeans, they had been beached along the shores of the rest of the U-shaped bay, as we read at I.14.033–036. See the comment on those verses. These other ships, then, are peripheral to the ships beached at the central shoreline of the bay, which are pictured as the headquarters of the Achaeans. And these headquarers, as noted in the comment on I.11.806–808, are called the <em>naustathmon</em> ‘ship-station’ by Strabo 13.1.31–32 C595 (quoted at HPC 153) and 13.1.36 C598 (quoted at HPC 154). Also, as noted in the comments on I.11.806–808, Homeric poetry pictures such a ‘station’ as a political and sacral centerpoint for the leaders of the Achaeans. See also the comments on I.08.220–227. It is this central station that becomes the political stage of Agamemnon when he stands on the beached ship of Odysseus and projects his voice of authority to all the Achaeans stationed at their ships, I.08.220–227. And it is this central station, we will see later in more detail, that becomes the prime target of the Trojan hero Hector when he succeeds in penetrating the Achaean Wall. Also in a later comment, there will be more to say about the sharing of this central space by two figures in particular, Agamemnon and Odysseus. The joint participation of these two Homeric heroes in the innermost political zone that is marked by this spatial centerpoint is homologous with their engagement in two epic quarrels involving Achilles as a political outsider: the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon in the <em>Iliad</em>, it can be argued, is linked with the quarrel between Achilles and Odysseus in the “micro-<em>Iliad</em>” at O.08.072–083, which is the First Song of Demodokos (BA 42–58).  </p>

From the dramatic standpoint of the immediate narrative context, Hērā is making up what she is saying; in the comments that follow, however, it is argued that the wording of the goddess here derives from genuine theogonic traditions centering on the idea of sacred intercourse as an act of cosmogonic creation.</p>

# Iliad 14.238–14.240

<p>The goddess Hērā promises to commission the making of a beautiful <em>thronos</em> ‘throne’, I.14.238. The maker will be the divine artisan Hephaistos, son of Hērā, I.14.239–240. This throne made by the god will be <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’, and this imperishability will last <em>aiei</em> ‘forever’, I.14.238. Also, this throne will be <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’, I.14.239. (On the combination of <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ and <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’ in symbolizing the artificial continuum of immortality, see BA 179.) The Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adverb <em>aieí</em> ‘always’ here is comparable to the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adjective <em>viśvā́yur</em> ‘lasting for all ages’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7: the form viśvā́yur is the neuter of <em>viśvā́yus</em>-, agreeing with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’. (Full argumentation in GMP 123–126 for interpreting <em>viśvā́yur</em> as a neuter and not masculine adjective in this context: it goes with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ and not, as some have argued, with the name of the god Indra.) The element <em>ā́yus-</em> in this Indic form is cognate with Greek <em>aiṓn</em> ‘life-force, lifetime’, the original locative singular of which became the adverb <em>aieí</em>, meaning ‘forever’. See the note on I.01.052. The formulaic combination <em>áphthiton aieí</em> is attested elsewhere as well in Homeric diction, at I.02.046 and at I.02.186. And there is even an instance of the combination <em>kléos áphthiton aieí</em> ‘a glory that is imperishable forever’ in an archaic piece of poetry inscribed in the seventh century BCE: κλεFος απθιτον αιFει, DGE no. 316. This combination brings us back to the wording κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται = <em>kléos áphthiton éstai</em> ‘there will be an imperishable glory’ at I.09.413. To be noted again is the parallelism between the Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ at I.09.413 and the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7 (full argumentation in GMP 123–126).  </p>

# Iliad 14.508

<p>lemmatizing: <strong>ἔσπετε νῦν μοι Μοῦσαι Ὀλύμπια δώματ&#x27; ἔχουσαι</strong></p><p>This re-invocation of the Muses signals a false start, since the interlude of the sexual encounter between Zeus and Hērā has resulted in a reversal of fortunes that is not to last for long. Right now, while Zeus is asleep after having made love to Hērā, the temporary intervention of Poseidon on the side of the Achaeans results in a compressed sequence of clipped narratives featuring only a few personal victories for only a few Achaean heroes. At I.14.509–510, the Master Narrator is asking the Muses: which one of the Achaeans has the first of these personal victories? The answer comes right away at I.14.511: Ajax son of Telamon is the first. What follows at I.14.511–512 is a most abbreviated narrative about this personal victory of Ajax, and what follows after that is a string of comparably abbreviated narratives about further personal victories achieved by five other Achaeans, I.14.513–522. Then, once these abbreviated narratives are completed, <em>Iliad</em> 14 comes to a hasty end. As soon as <em>Iliad</em> 15 begins, Zeus will be waking up, I.15.004–005. But before the god awakens, we see within the abbreviated space of I.14.513-522 a series of five more Achaeans achieving their own personal victories. Their victories, together with the initial victory of Ajax, are narrated at a pace that is noticeably hurried. There is no time to lose, and that is because, as already noted, Zeus will soon be waking up, I.15.004–005. Once the god does awaken, the momemtum will belong once again to the Trojans. So, the Achaeans benefit here only from a temporary upswing, which will soon be followed by another downswing.</p>

# Iliad 15.56–77

<p>Zeus here reaffirms what he wishes or wills, that is, he reaffirms his plan. And this Plan of Zeus, which is the wish or Will of Zeus, will be coextensive with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, starting with the original promise of Zeus to Thetis at the beginning of the epic, at I.01.524–530. What the god had then promised, that he will honor Achilles by letting the Achaeans lose until the fire of Hector reaches their beached ships, had been signaled when Zeus originally nodded his head at I.01.524–530. Now at I.15.075 Zeus refers again to this nodding of his head as he briefly retells the plot or narrative arc extending from the time of inception, which was the time when he had originally nodded. That narrative arc now extends not only to the present time of his retelling but also into a future time that has not yet been narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>: within this time-frame of future events, Poseidon will stop interfering on behalf of the Achaeans, I.15.056–058, and then Hector will be re-energized by Apollo and will thus stop the present momentum of the Achaeans, chasing them back to their beached ships, I.15.059–064, and then Achilles will send out Patroklos to stop the Trojans, I.15.064–065, and then Patroklos will be killed by Hector, I.15.065—but not before Patroklos himself kills many heroes fighting on the Trojan side, I.15.066–067, and among those killed heroes will be Sarpedon, who is the son of Zeus himself, I.15.067—and then, to top it all off, Achilles will experience anger [<em>kholos</em>] over the killing of Patroklos by Hector and will kill Hector, I.15.068. In the course of this almost breathlessly rapid retelling of the plot by Zeus, the foretelling of events yet to happen touches on the upcoming drama of the god’s personal loss of Sarpedon, who is his own human son. But the drama of this divine loss is still being elided for the moment, since Zeus at present is saying only that Sarpedon will be killed by Patroklos. The god is not yet saying that Sarpedon is his own beloved son. But that is not all. All has not yet been retold, even at this point, at I.15.068, which signals the killing of Hector by Achilles. The god’s retelling of the plot in the form of a foretelling is not yet completed at this point. The retelling by Zeus continues even further, starting with I.15.069: after Achilles kills Hector, Zeus will plan to bring about a reversal for the Trojans, who will now be driven back from the beached ships that they had threatened to destroy under Hector’s leadership, and the story of this <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’, I.15.069, is described in the god’s wording as if it were some kind of an artifact that Zeus himself has fashioned in the mode of an artisan: the key word is <em>teukhein</em> ‘make-as-an-artisan’ (τεύχοιμι), I.15.070, which takes the noun <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’ as its direct object, I.15.069. After this story of the <em>paliōxis</em> ‘driving back’, fashioned by Zeus in the mode of some divine artisan who creates the story by narrating the story, there will be a relentlessly consequential narrative that will lead all the way to the very end, which is, the destruction of Troy, I.15.070–071. This ending, however, extends beyond the time-frame that will be narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>. And such an ending, perhaps surprisingly, is said by Zeus to result from the <em>boulai</em> ‘plans’ of the god’s divine daughter, the goddess Athena, I.15.071 (Ἀθηναίης διὰ βουλάς). Why does Zeus speak here about the plans of Athena, as if they were not his own plans? It is because the plans of the goddess are by implication coextensive with the plans of her divine father as well. But Zeus is not yet finished with the announcement of his plan. Having indicated the outer limit of the epic plotline, which is the destruction of Troy at I.15.071, Zeus now returns to the present, indicating how it will extend into the immediate future of the <em>Iliad</em>. I will not cease my anger [<em>kholos</em>] against the Achaeans, the god declares at I.15.072, and I will not let any other god intervene on their behalf, I.15.073, until the wish of Achilles is fulfilled, I.15.074. That wish, as we already know, is that the Achaeans will keep losing until the fire of Hector reaches their beached ships. But Zeus here does not repeat the wording of that wish, even though he has promised to make the wish happen. Instead, he simply declares that he had made for Achilles a promise by way of nodding his divine head, I.15.075, and that this promise had been formulated for him by Thetis, the mother of Achilles, I.15.076–077. What Zeus had promised, the god says, was that Achilles should be ‘given honor’, as expressed by the verb <em>tīmân</em>, I.15.077 (τιμῆσαι).  </p>

The outlines of such a compressed epic narrative, formulated here as the Plan of Zeus, resemble what we see in the surviving plot-summaries of the epic Cycle. On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.

On connotations of intelligence by way of the word <em>boulē</em> in the sense of ‘planning’, see the comments on I.10.043–052, to be supplemented by the comments on I.11.200 and on I.11.627. </p>

# Iliad 15.233

<p>The Hellespont is a focal point for the heroic essence of Achilles: Homeric poetry presents his tomb as overlooking its dangerous waters, the setting for violent storms expressed by the same imagery that expresses the hero's cosmos affinity with fire and wind. Moreover, epic diction presents this fire and wind as primarily endangering the ships of the Achaeans, which are conventionally described as being beached along the shores of the bay of the Hellespont (as here, I.17.432, I.18.150, and I.22.002). In other words, the Hellespont is also a focal point for the heroic essence of all the Achaeans who came to fight at Troy. </p><p>From the standpoint of a Homeric audience in the eighth or seventh centuries B.C., the site of the Trojan War is significant not so much because of Troy itself but because of the Hellespont, passage to the Black Sea. And the prime affinity of Achilles with the Hellespont and the realms to which it leads will survive for centuries, well beyond the classical period. From inscriptions found in the Black Sea area, we know that Achilles still presides over the <em>póntos</em> even as late as the second/third centuries A.D.: he is in fact still worshipped as the <em>Pontárhkēs</em> 'Ruler of the <em>Póntos</em>'. </p><p>See especially the comment on I.08.220–227.</p>

# Iliad 15.385

<p>References to the topography of the Troad in the <em>Iliad</em> reveal a remarkable consistency and precision in visualizing that topography. But there is more to it than consistency and precision. These references are also external indications of an internal reality, and that reality is the formulaic system of Homeric poetry—a system that organizes the external reality of what is pictured by that poetry. The <em>Iliad</em> situates the <em>naustathmon</em>, imagined as the 'harbor of the Achaeans', in the Trojan Bay of the Hellespont. (We see an explicit reference to this bay at I.14.036.) According to the <em>Iliad</em>, the ships of the Achaeans are beached along the coastline of this bay, with their sterns pointing inward, contiguous with the Achaean Wall, and with their prows pointing outward in the direction of the water. So the <em>naustathmon</em> is not to be imagined as a harbor in the modern sense of the word: according to the <em>Iliad</em>, the ships of the Achaeans were neither anchored offshore in a harbor nor docked in a harbor. </p><p>See also the comment at I.14.027–036.</p>

# Iliad 15.431

<p>Hector is throwing his spear at the hero Ajax but misses, and the flying spear hits instead the hero Lykophron, described here as the <em>therapōn</em> of Ajax, I.15.431. So, Lykophron as <em>therapōn</em> is not only the ‘attendant’ of Ajax but also his ‘ritual substitute’. When Lykophron “takes the hit” for Ajax, he is standing right next to him, as if the two of them were standing side by side on the platform of a chariot. It is the physical reality of thus standing side by side that makes the chariot driver the prime alternative target for “taking the hit” in place of the chariot fighter. The chariot driver is thus the perfect substitute for the chariot fighter. In this case, however, Ajax and Lykophron are standing side by side not on the platform of a chariot but on the deck of the beached ship that the two of them are defending from the fire of Hector. The venue for ritual substitution is different, but the ritual pose, as it were, of standing side by side remains the same.  </p>

tags: la belle mort, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 15.494–499

<p>What follows is an epitome from HC 4§268. These verses containing the words of Hector, I.15.494–499, are quoted in a speech delivered by the Athenian statesman Lycurgus, <em>Against Leokrates</em> (103). The context is this: Lycurgus is arguing that the beautiful death foreseen by Hector, his <em>belle mort</em>, can be pictured as a model for Athenians when they contemplate the possibility that they too will die when they fight their wars. Lycurgus refers to the willingness of Athenian citizens to die in war not only for their own <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ but also for all of Hellas as a <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 104). Lycurgus invokes as his prime example the <em>belle mort</em> of the Athenian citizen-warriors who fought at Marathon and who thereby won for Hellas a freedom from terror, an <em>adeia</em> ‘security’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (104). The Athenian statesman is making this reference to the interests of Athens in the context of actually quoting the words of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em>, who says that he is willing to die for his fatherland in order to protect it against the Achaeans (Lycurgus <em>Against Leokrates</em> 103 lines 4–9). These heroic words of Hector correspond to I.15.494–499 here, and Lycurgus quotes them in the larger context of saying that the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, as performed at the quadrennial Athenian festival of the Panathenaia, are the ancestral heritage of the Athenians and the primary source of their education as citizen-warriors (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 102). In this invocation of Homeric poetry as the most sublime expression of the Athenian empire, the statesman is quoting the words of a Trojan, not the words of an Achaean. It is the <em>belle</em> <em>mort</em> of Hector that motivates the Athenians to live up to the heroic legacy they learn from Homer.</p>

# Iliad 15.592–602

<p>Zeus has been waiting for the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’. It will appear when the first of the beached Achaean ships is set on fire, I.15.600. Once the god sees that fire with his own eyes, his promise to Thetis will be fulfilled. He will have given to Achilles the honor that he had promised when he had nodded his head to indicate his plan, which was the Will of Zeus up until now. But now the <em>paliōxis</em> or ‘driving back’ of the Trojans by the counterattacking Achaeans, I.15.601, can get underway, I.15.602. On the technical function of <em>paliōxis</em> or ‘driving back’ as a poetic term referring to a specific part of the Iliadic narration, see I.15.069 and the comment on I.15.056–077. And now the <em>kūdos</em> ‘sign of glory’ will shift away from the Trojans and return to the Achaeans, I.15.602. Earlier, at I.12.255, the <em>kūdos</em> ‘sign of glory’ had gone over to the Trojans. See the comment on I.12.255–257.  </p>

tags: biē ‘force, violence, strength’, kleos 'glory', bíē Hēraklēeíē ‘force of Hēraklēs’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 15.640

<p>We can understand <em>bíē '</em>force, violence' as a key to the <em>kléos</em> 'glory' of Achilles/Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em>/<em>Odyssey</em>, as well to the <em>kléos </em>of other heroes in the epic tradition. In the case of Herakles, for example, the theme of <em>bíē</em> is actually embodied in the hero's identity, since he is conventionally named not only as <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> but also as <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em>, as here (βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ). The fact that a full declension of this periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs </em>is attested in the diction of archaic hexameter poetry is itself striking evidence, on the level of form, that the Herakles figure and <em>bíē</em> are traditionally linked on the level of theme. Since the very name <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> 'he who has the <em>kléos</em> of Hera' embodies the them of glory <em>through epic</em>, the tradition combination of <em>bíē</em><em> </em>with <em>kléos</em> in the periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em> is a formal indication that <em>bíē</em> is a traditional epic theme. The heroic resource of <em>bíē</em>, then, has a distinctly positive aspect as a key to the hero's <em>kléos</em>. Nevertheless, it has a disquieting negative aspect as well, as in the case of the <em>Odyssey</em>, where Odysseus uses <em>bíē</em><em> </em>to kill the suitors and the overall behavior of the suitors themselves is also characterized as <em>bíē </em>(e.g., O.23.031). </p><p>See also I.02.658, I.02.666, I.04.386, I.05.638, I.11.690, and I.19.098.</p>

In the course of leading the attack, Hector grabs hold of the <em>prumnē</em> ‘stern’ of one of the beached ships—the ship that had belonged to the hero Protesilaos, I.15.705–706, who was first of the Achaeans to be killed at Troy. On Protesilaos, see the earlier comment on I.02.695–709 and I.13.681, also the later comment below on I.15.704–706. Holding on to the <em>prumnē</em> ‘stern’ of this ship, I.15.716, Hector now shouts to his fellow Trojans and calls on them to bring him fire so that he may set this specially prized ship ablaze, I.15.718. In this context, Hector describes himself as fighting next to the <em>prumnai</em> ‘sterns’of the ships, I.15.722, which had been pulled ashore with their backs facing away from the sea and facing toward the attacking Trojans, I.15.718–725. The view of the narrative now shifts to Ajax, who is shown to be unable to hold off the attacking Trojans any longer, I.15.727: Αἴας δ’ οὐκέτ’ ἔμιμνε ‘Ajax could not hold them off any longer’. Now Ajax makes a strategic partial withdrawal, I.15.728, stepping off the <em>ikria</em> ‘deck’ of the ship of Protesilaos, I.15.729, which is where he had been standing, I.15.730. So, Ajax now fights on a lower level, I.15.729, and from further back inside the ship, I.15.728, but at least he continues to fight back, I.15.743–746, encouraging his fellow Achaeans to fight back as well I.15.732, and his words of encouragement, as quoted at I.15.733–741, are uttered in the form of a ritual shout, as expressed by the verb <em>boân</em> I.15.732. The focusing at I.15.696–746 on the stern of the ship of Protesilaos will become an essential narrative link in later phases of the narration about the Battle of the Ships. Already at I.15.704–706, Hector’s action in grabbing the stern of the ship of Protesilaos signals a tipping point: the defenses of the Achaeans, especially as represented by Ajax, are about to fail. In Bacchylides Ode 13.105–108, on the other hand, there is a reference to an alternative epic tradition about the role of Ajax. In this version, Ajax stands his ground on the stern of the beached ship: |105 ὅστ’ ἐπὶ πρύμναι σταθ[εὶς] |106 ἔσχεν θρασυκάρδιον [ὁρ]|107 μαίνοντα ν[ᾶας]|108 θεσπεσίωι πυ[ρὶ ––]| ‘(Ajax,) the one who, standing on the stern of the ship, held off Hector of the bold heart. (Hector) was attacking the ships with his fire [pūr], wondrous to tell about, […]’.  </p>

# Iliad 16

<p>It seems at first as if everything is coming together here in <em>Iliad</em> 16. Achilles, best of the Achaeans, sends out his other self, Patroklos, to fight Hector and his Trojans, who are now on the verge of setting on fire and destroying all the beached ships of the Achaeans. Patroklos does in fact succeed in stopping the fire, which had been endangering not only the survival of the Achaeans but even the very existence of their notional descendants, imagined as the Greeks who are listening to the story of the <em>Iliad</em> in their own time. The conflagration that could have burned down the beached ships of the Achaeans is now literally ‘quenched’ by Patroklos, whose heroic action in putting out the fire of the Trojans is compared in a simile to a cosmic action taken by Zeus himself when this weather-god drenches and thus destroys in a violent rainstorm the farmlands of unjust men. Clearly, Zeus is now once again on the Achaean side of the Trojan War. But the success of Patroklos is not to last: soon after he kills Sarpedon, son of Zeus himself, in the course of a spectacular chariot fight, Patroklos now gets killed in the course of a second spectacular chariot fight. This time, Patroklos has gone too far, daring to attack not only Hector but also the divine protector of that hero, Apollo himself. Now everything is about to come apart again, and Achilles has yet to find out about the tragedy that awaits him.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Terracotta_biga_Louvre_CA2959_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>A chariot driver and a chariot fighter in a <em>biga</em> (two-horses chariot).

I repeat here the translation: ‘tell me now, you Muses who have your dwellings on Mount Olympus’.

For more on the poetics of re-invocation, see also the comments on I.02.761, I.14.508. Here at I.16.112 the special moment of poetic self-awareness corresponds to the heroic self-awareness of Hector, as analyzed in the comment on I.08.180–183. Since the Muses are the goddesses of poetic memory, their re-invocation by the Master Narrator here at I.16.112 is a fulfillment of the original prediction of Hector: there will be <em>mnēmosunē</em> ‘memory’, I.08.181, of the moment when he will set fire to the beached ships of the Achaeans in the epic Battle for the Ships.</p>

The symbolism of this spear corresponds to the myth of the bronze generation of heroes in Hesiod <em>Works and Days </em>143–151, who were born of ash trees and were made of bronze, just as the shaft of the spear of Achilles is made from an ash tree while the tip is made of bronze. By contrast with the immortalizing armor that Achilles receives from his immortal mother Thetis, he receives the ash spear from his mortal father Peleus. For more on the symbolism of the hero’s ash spear, I recommend Shannon 1975.  </p>

# Iliad 16.143

<p>The word <em>melíē</em> functions as the word for both "ash tree" (e.g. I.16.767) and "ash spear" (as it does here). For a thorough discussion of the Homeric evidence, see <em>The Arms of Achilles and Homeric Compositional Technique</em> (1975) by Richard Shannon, especially pp. 46–48 for his comments on <em>Works and Days </em>143–155. There is a manifestation of the heroic type represented by the Bronze Men of Hesiod in the heroic character of Achilles himself, and more specifically, in the spear he wields. In fact, Achilles is described as the only hero who could wield this magnificent spear (I.16.140–142), which is also the only piece of the hero's armor that Patroklos did not take with him when he fatally replaced Achilles. In sum, the diction of the entire <em>Iliad</em> makes the bronze-tipped ash spear an emblem of Achilles just as surely as the bronze and ash wood characterize the equally wanton Bronze Men, who are depicted by Hesiod as bent on nothing but <em>húbris</em> and war. </p>

# Iliad 16.279

<p>As Patroklos rides off to battle, soon to die as the ritual substitute of Achilles, we see here standing next to him on the chariot his very own <em>therapōn</em>. It becomes clear, as the narrative proceeds, that this <em>therapōn</em> is the hero Automedon. Does this hero function here not only as the ‘attendant’ of Patroklos but also as that hero’s very own ‘ritual substitute’? The answer is: no. Automedon is temporarily the chariot driver for Patroklos, but he will not become a ritual substitute for him. True, we see Automedon functioning as an ‘attendant’ at I.16.145–154, where he yokes the horses of Achilles to the chariot that he will drive for Patroklos: so, Automedon is definitely a temporary attendant for Patroklos as well as his temporary chariot driver. But Automedon will not become a ritual substitute for Patroklos.  </p>

# Iliad 16.456–457

<p>These two verses, repeated at I.16.674–675 and foreshadowed by three verses at I.07.084–086 containing an indirect reference to the funeral and entombment of Achilles, refer to the funeral and entombment of Sarpedon in his role as a cult hero. Here I give an epitome of a far more detailed argumentation in Nagy 2012:60–69. In terms of hero cult, the wording that refers here at I.16.456–457 to a funeral and an entombment implies a ritual preparing of the dead body for a mystical revival after death. The word that refers to such immortalization in these Homeric passages is <em>tarkhuein</em> (ταρχύσουσι), at I.07.085, I.16.456, I.16.674. It can be argued that this Greek word <em>tarkhuein</em>, which I translate here neutrally as ‘ritually prepare’, is a borrowing from the Anatolian language that we know as Lycian, and that the corresponding Lycian word conveys the idea of ‘immortalize’. The most relevant forms in the surviving corpus of Anatolian linguistic evidence are (1) Lycian <em>Trqqñt</em>-, name of a Lycian thunder god; (2) the cognate Luvian form <em>Tarḫunt</em>-, name of the thunder god who is head of the Luvian pantheon; (3) the cognate Hittite form <em>tarḫu</em>-/<em>tar(r)uḫ</em>- (/<em>tarxw</em>-/), a verb meaning ‘be victorious, overcome’. Cognates of this Hittite verb <em>tarḫu</em>- in other Indo-European languages convey the idea of ‘overcome’ or ‘transcend’ in contexts where the object of transcendence is death itself (GMP 139). An example is the Greek compound noun <em>nek-tar</em> (νέκταρ), consisting of roots meaning ‘death’ (<em>nek</em>- as in <em>nekros</em> ‘corpse’) and ‘conquer’ (-<em>tar</em>, cognate with Hittite <em>tarḫu</em>-). I argue that the Lycian and the Luvian names of the thunder god convey the idea of revivifying as well as overcoming, since thunder gods as described in Indo-European languages have the power to use their thunder weapons not only to overcome violently their enemies but also to preserve and thus make sacred their own devotees—and even to revivify them (GMP 197; see also GMP 132–134).</p>

# Iliad 16.705-711

<p>Patroklos confronts Apollo four times and then backs off, thus avoiding the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the god, I.16.711. At the moment of his climactic fourth confrontation with Apollo, Patroklos is described as <em>daimoni isos</em> ‘equal to a <em>daimōn</em>’, I.16.705. The ‘superhuman force’ to which this word <em>daimōn</em> refers here can be understood to be Apollo himself. We see here a climactic moment in a pattern of divine-human antagonism that links the god Apollo with the hero Achilles, but Patroklos can now take upon himself the role of a ritual substitute for Achilles.  </p>

tags: wishes correlated with premises, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 16.722–723

<p>We see at I.16.722 a wish that is predicated on confidence in some specific certainty: αἴθ ὅσον ἥσσων εἰμί, τόσον σέο φέρτερος εἴην ‘If only I could be superior to you—as surely as I am that much inferior to you!’ On the syntax of such wishes, see the comment on I.18.464–466. In this case, however, the predicated certainty is falsified, since the speaker is Apollo disguised as Hector’s uncle, and the god is of course superior rather than inferior to Hector. Here I epitomize the analysis in GMP 300. Apollo now says, in the guise of Hector’s uncle: if you were that much inferior, then you would retreat in battle, I.16.723. But, since Hector is supposedly that much superior to his uncle, he is of course expected not to retreat. What is hidden in these comparisons is the relative stature of the god himself: the uncle is to Hector as Hector is to Apollo. From the standpoint of Hector, the premise in Apollo’s use of the idiom is reality: the uncle is inferior to Hector. Here I repeat the wording of I.16.722: αἴθ ὅσον ἥσσων εἰμί, τόσον σέο φέρτερος εἴην ‘If only I could be superior to you—as surely as I am that much inferior to you!’ From the standpoint of Apollo and the framing narrative, however, the premise is false: Apollo is superior, not inferior, to Hector. Therefore the wish that is based on the premise is augmented: the ‘that much’ of ‘let me be that much superior to you’ is immeasurably more than Hektor might think.  </p>

# Iliad 17

<p>The main preoccupation of the Achaeans here in <em>Iliad</em> 17 is to recover the corpse of Patroklos. Their efforts are understandable, in that they are showing their sense of solidarity by trying to rescue from harm the body of a fellow warrior who has fallen in battle. But the motivation here goes deeper. Patroklos is a cult hero in the making, and the corpses of heroes are essential for establishing hero cults in their honor. And the foreseen status of Patroklos as cult hero prefigures a comparable status for Achilles himself beyond the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/22_Piroli_Flaxman_Ilias_1795_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:(22)_Flaxman_Ilias_1795,_Zeichnung_1793,_188_x_344_mm.jpg">Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman</a><a>.</a>Photographed/scanned by H.-P.Haack (Antiquariat Dr. Haack Leipzig) [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.</p>

# Gentle Menelaos

<p>Book 17 opens with Menelaos noticing that Patroklos has been killed. He immediately moves to protect the body, bestriding it like mother cow over her first-born calf. The scholia on these opening verses of the book note that it is particularly appropriate that Menelaos is the first to notice that Patroklos has died, for both are “gentle” (<strong>ἤπιοι</strong>). I’ll have more to say about the simile in the corresponding note on 17.4. </p><p></p><p>That Patroklos is a gentle soul is well established in the <em>Iliad</em>. At <em>Iliad</em> 17.670–672 Menelaos urges his companions to remember Patroklos, who was “gentle”:</p><p></p><p>νῦν τις <strong>ἐνηείης</strong> Πατροκλῆος δειλοῖο</p><p>μνησάσθω· πᾶσιν γὰρ ἐπίστατο <strong>μείλιχος</strong> εἶναι</p><p>ζωὸς ἐών· νῦν αὖ θάνατος καὶ μοῖρα κιχάνει.</p><p></p><p>Now let everyone call to mind the wretched Patroklos, who was gentle.</p><p>For he knew how to be kind to to all,</p><p>when he was alive. Now, however, death and fate have caught up with him. </p><p></p><p>Zeus likewise describes Patroklos gentle at 17.204, when he watches Hector put on Achilles’ armor, which he stripped from Patroklos:</p><p></p><p>τοῦ δὴ ἑταῖρον ἔπεφνες <strong>ἐνηέα</strong> τε κρατερόν τε</p><p></p><p>You slew his companion who was gentle and powerful</p><p></p><p>So too in her lament does Briseis remember Patroklos as being always kind (<strong>μείλιχον</strong> αἰεί; 19.300). The commentary by Hellenist and Roman scholars that survive in our Medieval manuscripts discuss Patroklos’ gentleness at numerous points. (See Richardson 1980:268–269 and 272 and the scholia on 11.616, 670, 677–678, 814, 12.1, and 19.297. See also the introductory note to this book for more on Patroklos.)</p><p>But Menelaos too is gentle. In the Venetus B manuscript of the <em>Iliad</em> (folio 231r), we find the following comment in the scholia at the beginning of this book:</p><p></p><p>εὖ Πατρόκλου πεσόντος πρῶτος αἰσθάνεται Μενέλαος· φησὶ γάρ· “ὃς κεῖται ἐμῆς εἵνεκ&#x27; ἐνθάδε τιμῆς” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.92]. καὶ ὅτι ὁμότροποι· ἄμφω γὰρ ἤπιοι· ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος οὐ μόνον πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχομένους πρᾷος ἦν, ἀλλ’ ἤδη καὶ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους, ἢ ὅτι καὶ περὶ πάντας σπουδαῖος ὁρᾶται· ὃς καὶ Ὀδυσσέως καταπονουμένου ἧκεν ἄγων Αἴαντα [<em>Iliad</em> 11.463–88]. καὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ προανέστη [<em>Iliad</em> 10.25–33]. ἢ προθυμότερον σύμμαχον ἑαυτῷ ποιῶν Ἀχιλλέα. ἄλλως τε οἱ ἄλλοι τραυματίαι εἰσὶ πλὴν Αἴαντος, ὃν νῦν οὐκ ἔδει ὑπείκειν Ἕκτορι.</p><p></p><p>It is a good thing that Menelaos is the first to notice that Patroklos has fallen, for he says “he lies here dead because of my honor” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.92]; and because they have similar characters, for both are gentle [<strong>ἤπιοι</strong>]; and Menelaos was gentle [<strong>πρᾷος</strong>] not only to those under his command, but also to his enemies; or because he is seen as zealous with respect to everyone; he who, also when Odysseus was in trouble, came and brought Ajax [<em>Iliad</em> 11.463–88]. And he got out of bed before his brother [<em>Iliad</em> 10.25–33]; or because he made Achilles a more eager ally for himself. Alternatively the others are wounded with the exception of Ajax, who did not have to give way to Hektor. (Translation is adapted from that of Victoria Ydens and Lisa Seldenthuis for the Homer Multitext.) </p><p></p><p>The Townley manuscript of the <em>Iliad</em> (folio 186v) has a longer version of same note with even more citations of the Homeric epics:</p><p></p><p>ὅς τις τοῦ γε [= 17.8]: αὐτοῦ τοῦ Μενελάου ἢ Πατρόκλου. εὖ Πατρόκλου πεσόντος πρῶτος αἰσθάνεται Μενέλαος· φησὶ γάρ· “ὃς κεῖται ἐμῆς εἵνεκ’ ἐνθάδε τιμῆς” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.92]. καὶ ὅτι ὁμότροποι· ἄμφω γὰρ ἤπιοι· “νῦν τις ἐνηείης Πατροκλῆος δειλοῖο / μνησάσθω” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.670–1]. ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος οὐ μόνον πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχομένους πρᾷος ἦν, ἀλλ’ ἤδη καὶ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους, ὥστε Ἄδραστον ζωγρήσας σώζειν ἐβούλετο [<em>Iliad</em> 6.37–53]. ἢ ὅτι καὶ περὶ πάντας σπουδαῖος ὁρᾶται. αὐτόματος ᾔει πρὸς τὴν δαῖτα [<em>Iliad</em> 2.408–9], προανέστη τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ [<em>Iliad</em> 10.25–33], Ὀδυσσέως καταπονουμένου ἧκεν ἄγων Αἴαντα [<em>Iliad</em> 11.463–88), ἔμεινεν ἐν τῷ Σουνίῳ “ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο, / ὄφρ’ ἕταρον θάπτοι” [<em>Odyssey</em> 3.284–5]. ἢ προθυμότερον ποιῶν ἑαυτῷ σύμμαχον Ἀχιλλέα. ἄλλως τε οἱ ἄλλοι τραυματίαι εἰσὶ πλὴν Αἴαντος, ᾧ νῦν οὐκ ἔδει ὑπείκειν Ἕκτορι.</p><p></p><p>The αὐτοῦ refers to Menelaos or Patroklos. It is a good thing that Menelaos is the first to notice that Patroklos has fallen, for he says “he lies here dead because of my honor” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.92]; and because they have similar characters, for both are gentle [<strong>ἤπιοι</strong>]: “Now let everyone call to mind the wretched Patroklos who was gentle [<strong>ἐνηείης</strong>]” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.670–1]. And Menelaos was gentle [<strong>πρᾷος</strong>] not only to those under his command, but also to his enemies, such that he wanted to keep Adrastos alive after capturing him [<em>Iliad</em> 6.37–53]; or because he is also seen as zealous with respect to everyone: he came of his own accord to the feast [<em>Iliad</em> 2.408–9], he got out of bed before his brother [<em>Iliad</em> 10.25–33], when Odysseus was in trouble, came and brought Ajax [<em>Iliad</em> 11.463–88], he waited in Sounion “although very eager for the journey, in order that he bury his comrade” [<em>Odyssey</em> 3.284–5]. Or because he made Achilles a more eager ally for himself. Alternatively the others are wounded with the exception of Ajax, who did not have to give way to Hektor.</p><p></p><p>And finally the Venetus A manuscript also preserves a slightly more compressed version of this same idea with some variation (folio 223v):</p><p></p><p>οὐδ᾽ ἔλαθ᾽ Ἀτρέος υἱὸν: Πατρόκλου πεσόντος πρὼτος αἰσθεται Μενέλαος φησὶ γὰρ “ὃς κεῖται ἐμῆς ἔνεκ’ ἐνθάδε τιμῆς” [<em>Iliad</em> 17.92]. καὶ ὅτι ὁμότροποι ἄμφω γὰρ ἥπιοι. ὁ δὲ Μενέλαος οὐ μόνον πρὸς τοὺς ἀρχόμένους ἤπιος ἦν, ἀλλ’ ἤδη καὶ προς τὸυς πολεμίους ὥστε Ἄδραστον ζωγρήσας σὼζειν ἐβούλετο ἢ ὅτι καὶ περὶ πάντα σπουδαῖος ὁρᾶται. δεόντως τὸν Μενέλαον ἐν τῷ νῦν παρεισήγαγε καιρῷ βοηθοῦντα καὶ ἀγωνιζόμενον, μάλιστα μὲν διὰ τὸ τετρῶσθαι τοὺς αριστεῖς. ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ δίκαιον ἡγεῖτο τὸυς δι’ αὐτῶν τελευτήσαντας μὴ καταλιπεῖν, ἀλλὰ βοηθεῖν παντὶ σθένει.</p><p></p><p>Menelaos first notices that Patroklos has fallen. For he says “he lies here dead because of my honor”; and because they have similar characters, for both are gentle; and Menelaos is not only gentle to those under his command, but also to his enemies, similar to the way he wanted to keep Adrastos alive after having captured him or because he is seen as zealous in every way. He [the poet] necessarily introduced Menelaos at this critical moment as someone who is helpful and who participates in the competition, especially because the leaders [= “the best men”] were wounded. Moreover, he [the poet] thought that it is right that he not leave behind those who died on their account, but that he help them with all his strength. (Translation is adapted from that of Victoria Ydens and Lisa Seldenthuis for the Homer Multitext.)</p><p></p><p>The wide range of citations in the Townley manuscript in particular suggests that there is indeed a systematic characterization of Menelaos as gentle in the epic tradition. He possesses a kind of tenderness and duty of care that his prowess on the battlefield does not negate. This may come as a surprise to modern readers raised on cinematic and television portrayals of Menelaos as cruel and violent, someone that Helen would naturally forsake in favor of the handsome and less warlike Alexander.</p><p></p><p>There are a number of passages in the <em>Iliad</em> that show Menelaos to be someone that Agamemnon in particular fears for on the battlefield. In book 4, Athena reignites the battle by inciting Pandaros to shoot an arrow at Menelaos. The arrow does in fact hit him, but it is not a mortal wound, because Athena deflects it: </p><p></p><p>Οὐδὲ σέθεν Μενέλαε θεοὶ μάκαρες λελάθοντο </p><p>ἀθάνατοι, πρώτη δὲ Διὸς θυγάτηρ ἀγελείη,</p><p>ἥ τοι πρόσθε στᾶσα βέλος ἐχεπευκὲς ἄμυνεν. </p><p>ἣ δὲ τόσον μὲν ἔεργεν ἀπὸ χροὸς ὡς ὅτε μήτηρ </p><p>παιδὸς ἐέργῃ μυῖαν ὅθ’ ἡδέϊ λέξαται ὕπνῳ, </p><p>αὐτὴ δ’ αὖτ’ ἴθυνεν ὅθι ζωστῆρος ὀχῆες </p><p>χρύσειοι σύνεχον καὶ διπλόος ἤντετο θώρηξ. </p><p></p><p>But the blessed, immortal gods did not forget you, Menelaos,</p><p>and the daughter of Zeus who drives off spoils [=Athena] was the first, </p><p>who took a stand in front of you and warded off the piercing missile. </p><p>She kept it far from your skin, as when a mother</p><p>keeps a fly from her child when he lies in sweet sleep,</p><p>and she guided it to where the golden clasps</p><p>of the belt joined and the two parts of the breastplate met. (<em>Iliad</em> 4.127–133)</p><p></p><p>Here we see that Athena herself is maternally protective of Menelaos even as she herself initiates his wounding. (For more on this passage see Dué and Ebbott 2012 and the next note.)</p><p></p><p>Agamemnon’s reaction to seeing the superficial wound is to shudder in fear, and his <em>thumos</em> momentarily leaves his body before being gathered back in again (4.152: ἄψορρόν οἱ θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἀγέρθη). As Kirk (1985 <em>ad loc</em>) points out, this is precisely what happens to Andromache, when she recovers from fainting in the shock of learning of Hektor’s death (ἔμπνυτο καὶ ἐς φρένα θυμὸς ἀγέρθη, 22.475). But what Kirk does not note is that that recovery segues immediately in the next line to Andromache’s lament for her fallen husband (ἀμβλήδην γοόωσα μετὰ Τρῳῇσιν ἔειπεν). So too Agamemnon holds Menelaos by the hand and makes a sound that elsewhere accompanies lament (βαρὺ στενάχων 153), and their comrades echo him in an antiphonal response (ἐπεστενάχοντο δ’ ἑταῖροι 154; cf. <em>Iliad</em> 19.301, 22.515, 24.722, 24.746, 24.776, Alexiou 1974:131–160 and Dué 2002:70–71 and 80–81). His speech that follows begins very much like a lament as well:</p><p></p><p>φίλε κασίγνητε θάνατόν νύ τοι ὅρκι᾽ ἔταμνον</p><p>οἶον προστήσας πρὸ Ἀχαιῶν Τρωσὶ μάχεσθαι,</p><p>ὥς σ᾽ ἔβαλον Τρῶες, κατὰ δ᾽ ὅρκια πιστὰ πάτησαν.</p><p></p><p>Beloved brother, death to you were the oaths I cut,</p><p>when I set you up alone to fight before the Achaeans with the Trojans,</p><p>since the Trojans have struck you, and trampled on trusty oaths. (4.155–157)</p><p></p><p>As Alexiou demonstrates in her seminal study (1974/2002), surviving examples of ancient Greek laments in literature have a typical structure that begins with a direct address followed by a narrative about the past and/or future. Agamemnon briefly tells what has just occurred to cause Menelaos’ wounding, but he also invokes the future. That future is somewhat curiously the sack of Troy, a moment that should be full of triumph for Agamemnon, but it becomes instead a source of shame if Menelaos dies. Essentially, Agamemnon says, Troy is definitely going to fall, but I will experience terrible grief if you fall too, and shame for returning home without you:</p><p></p><p>εὖ γὰρ ἐγὼ τόδε οἶδα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν:</p><p>ἔσσεται ἦμαρ ὅτ᾽ ἄν ποτ᾽ ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἱρὴ</p><p>καὶ Πρίαμος καὶ λαὸς ἐϋμμελίω Πριάμοιο,</p><p>Ζεὺς δέ σφι Κρονίδης ὑψίζυγος αἰθέρι ναίων</p><p>αὐτὸς ἐπισσείῃσιν ἐρεμνὴν αἰγίδα πᾶσι</p><p>τῆσδ᾽ ἀπάτης κοτέων. τὰ μὲν ἔσσεται οὐκ ἀτέλεστα·</p><p>ἀλλά μοι αἰνὸν ἄχος σέθεν ἔσσεται ὦ Μενέλαε</p><p>αἴ κε θάνῃς καὶ πότμον ἀναπλήσῃς βιότοιο.</p><p>καί κεν ἐλέγχιστος πολυδίψιον Ἄργος ἱκοίμην.</p><p>αὐτίκα γὰρ μνήσονται Ἀχαιοὶ πατρίδος αἴης.</p><p>κὰδ δέ κεν εὐχωλὴν Πριάμῳ καὶ Τρωσὶ λίποιμεν</p><p>Ἀργείην Ἑλένην· σέο δ᾽ ὀστέα πύσει ἄρουρα</p><p>κειμένου ἐν Τροίῃ ἀτελευτήτῳ ἐπὶ ἔργῳ.</p><p>καί κέ τις ὧδ᾽ ἐρέει Τρώων ὑπερηνορεόντων</p><p>τύμβῳ ἐπιθρῴσκων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο:</p><p>αἴθ᾽ οὕτως ἐπὶ πᾶσι χόλον τελέσει᾽ Ἀγαμέμνων,</p><p>ὡς καὶ νῦν ἅλιον στρατὸν ἤγαγεν ἐνθάδ᾽ Ἀχαιῶν,</p><p>καὶ δὴ ἔβη οἶκον δὲ φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν</p><p>σὺν κεινῇσιν νηυσὶ λιπὼν ἀγαθὸν Μενέλαον.</p><p>ὥς ποτέ τις ἐρέει: τότε μοι χάνοι εὐρεῖα χθών.</p><p></p><p>For I know this well in my heart and soul,</p><p>a day will come when holy Ilium will be destroyed,</p><p>and Priam and the people of Priam of the good ash spear.</p><p>And Zeus himself the son of Kronos who sits on high dwelling in the aether</p><p>will shake his dark aegis before all</p><p>in pent up anger for this deception.

And at that point may the earth gape open wide for me. (4.163–182)</p><p></p><p>Agamemnon’s imagined grief and future shame and longing for death in fact closely resemble Hektor’s own lament-like speech to Andromache in <em>Iliad</em> 6, with which Agamemnon’s speech shares entire verses, phraseology, and structure. Hektor has returned to Troy, and Andromache seizes the opportunity to persuade him to stay within the walls. He replies that he would rather die in battle than live to see her enslaved:</p><p></p><p>εὖ γὰρ ἐγὼ τόδε οἶδα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν:</p><p>ἔσσεται ἦμαρ ὅτ᾽ ἄν ποτ᾽ ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἱρὴ</p><p>καὶ Πρίαμος καὶ λαὸς ἐϋμμελίω Πριάμοιο.</p><p>ἀλλ᾽ οὔ μοι Τρώων τόσσον μέλει ἄλγος ὀπίσσω,</p><p>οὔτ᾽ αὐτῆς Ἑκάβης οὔτε Πριάμοιο ἄνακτος</p><p>οὔτε κασιγνήτων, οἵ κεν πολέες τε καὶ ἐσθλοὶ</p><p>ἐν κονίῃσι πέσοιεν ὑπ᾽ ἀνδράσι δυσμενέεσσιν,</p><p>ὅσσον σεῦ, ὅτε κέν τις Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων</p><p>δακρυόεσσαν ἄγηται ἐλεύθερον ἦμαρ ἀπούρας.</p><p>καί κεν ἐν Ἄργει ἐοῦσα πρὸς ἄλλης ἱστὸν ὑφαίνοις,</p><p>καί κεν ὕδωρ φορέοις Μεσσηΐδος ἢ Ὑπερείης</p><p>πόλλ᾽ ἀεκαζομένη, κρατερὴ δ᾽ ἐπικείσετ᾽ ἀνάγκη…</p><p>καί ποτέ τις εἴπῃσιν ἰδὼν κατὰ δάκρυ χέουσαν·</p><p>Ἕκτορος ἥδε γυνὴ ὃς ἀριστεύεσκε μάχεσθαι</p><p>Τρώων ἱπποδάμων ὅτε Ἴλιον ἀμφεμάχοντο.</p><p>ὥς ποτέ τις ἐρέει· σοὶ δ᾽ αὖ νέον ἔσσεται ἄλγος</p><p>χήτεϊ τοιοῦδ᾽ ἀνδρὸς ἀμύνειν δούλιον ἦμαρ.</p><p>ἀλλά με τεθνηῶτα χυτὴ κατὰ γαῖα καλύπτοι</p><p>πρίν γέ τι σῆς τε βοῆς σοῦ θ᾽ ἑλκηθμοῖο πυθέσθαι.</p><p></p><p>For I know this well in my heart and soul,</p><p>a day will come when holy Ilium will be destroyed,</p><p>and Priam and the people of Priam of the good ash spear.</p><p>But the pain of the Trojans in the future is not so much a concern for me</p><p>nor that of Hecuba herself nor of Lord Priam,</p><p>nor that of my brothers, who many and noble </p><p>have fallen in the dust at the hands of enemy men,</p><p>as much as your pain, when some one of the Achaeans with their bronze <em>khitons</em></p><p>leads you away weeping, having deprived you of your day of freedom.</p><p>And then being in Argos you will weave at the loom for another woman,</p><p>and carry water from the Middle Spring and Upper Spring,</p><p>treated very shamefully, and powerful necessity will lie upon you...</p><p>And someone who has seen you will say, shedding a tear:</p><p>“This is the wife of Hektor, who used to be the best at fighting,</p><p>the best of the horse-taming Trojans, when they fought around Troy.”</p><p>So someone will say. And it will be a fresh source of pain for you</p><p>to lack such a man to ward off the day of slavery.</p><p>May the heaped up earth of my tomb cover me dead </p><p>before I learn of your shout and your being dragged away. (6.447–465)</p><p></p><p>Whereas Agamemnon only imagines Menelaos’ death, what Hektor fears for Andromache, as we all know, will indeed come true. Hektor, like Andromache in her speech before him, draws on the powerful language of lament to make his case for returning to battle. (For more on Andromache’s lament see Foley 1999:188–198 and Dué 2002:68–73 with additional references <em>ad loc</em>.) We have then in <em>Iliad</em> 6 dueling proleptic laments from these two characters, which dramatically adds to the emotional effect of this scene. Hektor hears Andomache’s lamentation, and responds with a traditional lament of his own. This kind of responsion between the doomed couple makes their words even more evocative of an actual funeral.</p><p></p><p>Hektor’s variation on what I have elsewhere called “the captive woman’s lament” (Dué 2002) is powerful precisely because it is a multiform of a pattern of speech deeply imprinted on the audience. It is powerful because it repeats, because it draws on formulas that have evolved over centuries to express precisely this kind of otherwise inexpressible sorrow. The laments of Andromache and Hektor and of the captive Briseis in <em>Iliad</em> 19 are all multiforms of one another, and yet each perfectly communicates the very individual pain of each one. Agamemnon’s fears about Menelaos are yet another striking variation on this kind of lament. It is quite possible that for an ancient audience, the speech with its invocation of the certain fall of Troy would have evoked, with its shared formulaic language, Hektor’s own words in <em>Iliad</em> 6—words which have not yet been spoken yet in the <em>Iliad</em> as it has been handed down to us—and would have resonated with similar emotion. In other words, Agamemnon’s anxiety and fear and love for Menelaos, as well as his concern for his own legacy, are made analogous with that of the doomed Hektor. If the encounter between Hektor and Andromache was as celebrated in antiquity as it is today, this analogy must have conferred even greater tenderness and intensity of feeling on the words of Agamemnon than they have at face value.  </p><p></p><p>There is another place in the <em>Iliad</em> where we can observe Agamemnon’s protectiveness of Menelaos. In <em>Iliad</em> 10, when Diomedes has to choose a partner for the night mission against the Trojans (which becomes an ambush of Rhesus and his men), Agamemnon encourages him not to think about rank, but rather who would be the best man for the job (τὸν ἄριστον, <em>Iliad</em> 10.234–239). The narrator explicitly tells us that Agamemnon is worried he will choose Menelaos: ἔδεισεν δὲ περὶ ξανθῷ Μενελάῳ (10.240). Elsewhere in the epic tradition Menelaos is in fact a skilled ambusher: he is inside the Trojan Horse with Diomedes and Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.280), he successfully ambushes Proteus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.388–463), and he is one of the leaders of the night mission Odysseus describes to Eumaios (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.470–471). It seems that Agamemnon is afraid not about Menelaos’ lack of ability then, but about the danger of the mission. He is worried that Menelaos will not make it back. </p><p></p><p>These passages from <em>Iliad</em> 4 and 10, together with the citations in the scholia on 17.1, paint a picture of Menelaos that resembles Patroklos. Patroklos, while a fierce warrior in his own right, is the more kind and gentle other half of the Achilles-Patroklos fighting pair. Like Agamemnon, Achilles worries when Patroklos enters battle without him, and prays to Zeus that he make it home unscathed (<em>Iliad</em> 16.233–248). (The poem notes both here at 16.252 and at 18.238 that Patroklos does not in fact make it home safe.) So too is Menelaos the brother who typically gives way to Agamemnon, and for whom Agamemnon feels extremely protective (see also Frame 2009:214–216). But Menelaos, like Patroklos, is also concerned and protective of others: he is in the words of the scholia περὶ πάντας σπουδαῖος. He looks out for his comrades.</p><p></p><p>Patroklos and Menelaos are linked in another way: they are the two characters to elicit the most sympathy from the narrator in the <em>Iliad</em> through the use of apostrophe. Patroklos is addressed in the second person eight times in the <em>Iliad</em>, while Menelaos is twice addressed in the second person in this book (at 679 and 702), and seven times in the <em>Iliad</em> as a whole (Yamagata 1989, Edwards 1991.3 and ad 17.679–80, Jong 2004:16). These moments are usually quite dramatic moments in the story; in Patroklos’ case they cluster around his impending death. </p><p></p><p>There has been historically some controversy (outlined in Yamagata 1989) as to the poetic significance of these apostrophes, with some seeing their origin in metrical convenience as opposed to a desire on the part of the poet to express special sympathy. But such explanations imply that poets working with the epic tradition were constrained by epic diction and forced to express themselves other than how they would wish because of it. In fact, as Milman Parry and Albert Lord show through their field work, the formulaic diction in which oral poets compose evolved over centuries to serve their needs (not the other way around), and functions in that way much like a living language, with its own vocabulary and structure. In Lord’s discussion of the training of the singer, he observes that the singers learn the language of oral performance of poetry holistically, as a child learns a language. Thought, meter, and language are not separate in the process of composing-in-performance (Lord 1960/2000:31–36). John Foley, whose work has continued the comparative study of the South Slavic oral tradition that Parry and Lord began (see e.g. Foley 1999:37–111), has built on this idea to arrive at his general dictum that “oral poetry works like language, only more so” (Foley 2002:127–128). As in language generally, Foley argues following Lord, the poet’s thought, not meter, is the driving force of expression. I am therefore persuaded by those who see a special affinity for these characters in the poem as we now know it. </p><p></p><p>In conclusion, it appears that Menelaos and Patroklos are viewed as kindred spirits within the Homeric epic tradition, and that in antiquity it was therefore appreciated that Menelaos is the one to lead the charge to save Patroklos’ body after he has been killed. This book is in many ways Menelaos’ <em>aristeia</em>—though he relies heavily on the help he seeks out from Ajax and others—as he rallies the troops and refuses to let their spirits fail over the course of a long day of fighting in which the momentum constantly shifts, and no one is a clear winner. Although it requires assistance from Achilles in the end, the credit for saving Patroklos belongs largely to Menelaos. Why these two have been paired for this emotionally charged book (on which, see the introductory note for book 17, still forthcoming as of this initial posting) now seems clear.</p><p></p><p>Works consulted and cited in this post:</p><p></p><p>Alexiou, M. 1974/2002. <em>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition</em>.

# Iliad 17.050–060

<p>The hero Euphorbos, fighting on the Trojan side of the war, has just been killed by Menelaos the Achaean. The corpse of Euphorbos is described here as a generic <em>beau mort</em>, that is, as a dead body made beautiful by way of a beautiful death, <em>une belle mort</em>. (See the anchor comment on I.123.184–191 on the salvation of Hector’s body, with reference to Hector as the definitive <em>beau mort</em> of the <em>Iliad</em>.) There are two levels to be seen in the overall wording that describes the corpse of Euphorbos here. First, at I.17.050–051, the beauty of the body is indicated incidentally by way of focusing on a detailed description of the dead hero’s hair. Second, at I.17.53–60, the entire body of the dead hero is compared, by way of simile, to a tender young olive seedling or ernos that has just been uprooted by a violent gust of wind.</p>

<p>The death of Patroklos is viewed here retrospectively as a great <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’, I.17.099, that is sure to <em>kulindesthai</em> ‘roll’ down from the heights like some boulder and destroy anyone daring to attack a warrior who is being protected by a god. On the metaphor of such a <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ as a boulder that ‘rolls’ down from the heights, see the comment on I.11.347. In the present context, I.17.098–101, the <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ has descended upon Patroklos, who has dared to attack Hector while that warrior was being protected by Apollo. This <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ for Patroklos prefigures what will happen to Achilles himself beyond the <em>Iliad</em> when he dares to attack Paris while that warrior is in turn being protected by Apollo.  </p>

<p>In this retrospective, it is said that Patroklos has been killed as a <em>therapōn</em> of Achilles, who is described here as ‘best of the Achaeans’. The immediate context accommodates here even the deeper meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’, since Patroklos himself could become temporarily the ‘best of the Achaeans’ at the moment of his death. At that moment, he is substituting himself for Achilles by prefiguring a future moment, beyond the <em>Iliad</em>, when Achilles will die in a way that matches the way that Patroklos died in <em>Iliad</em> 16.</p>

# Iliad 17.194–214

<p>When Zeus sees Hector putting on the armor of Achilles, he nods his divine head, thus signaling his will, which in this case is a specific plan to make into a part of the overall narrative a special scene where the death of Hector at the hands of Achilles will cause grief for Andromache, who will never get see Hector wearing the armor of Achilles—since her husband will never return to her alive. Instead of welcoming back her husband in <em>Iliad</em> 22, Andromache will be lamenting him, and the wording at I.22.444 in the context of her impending lament at I.22.476–515 is already prefigured here at I.17.207, referring to the wife’s fond hope to be reunited with her loving husband. See also the comment on I.22.444. Thus the Will of Zeus, the god’s plan, is to create an exquisite artistic effect. Zeus plans here to put in motion a scene of sublime poetic virtuosity, since the epic narrative in <em>Iliad</em> 22 will soon re-enact the lyrical lament of Andromache over the death of Hector, I.22.476–515. Here at I.17.194–214, Zeus is speaking as if he were already the director of the scenario for such a future scene of lament. The god is in effect prefiguring the scene here by way of formally announcing his artistic involvement. Such an involvement can be seen as a kind of metonymic contact with the emotions of Andromache. On the metonymy here, see also the comment on I.01.528–530.</p>

# Iliad 17.319-322

<p>Here the Achaeans almost win the Trojan War. But that would be premature. In terms of the ordained narrative, such an event of winning would be ‘in-disaccord-with [<em>huper</em>] the portion [<em>aisa</em>] of Zeus’ (ὑπὲρ Διὸς αἶσαν), I.17.321. That is, the <em>aisa</em> or ‘apportionment’ of victory or defeat to the Achaeans and to the Trojans by Zeus is up to Zeus. Zeus gets to decide according to the plan of Zeus. And that plan cannot be contradicted, since the plot of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> must be the Will of Zeus. For more on the expression <em>huper aisan</em> ‘in disaccord with <em>aisa</em>’ (ὑπὲρ αἶσαν), see the comment on I.03.059. And, since the victory of the Achaeans depends on the Will of Zeus, the very idea that the Achaeans could win ‘by way of their own winning-power [<em>kratos</em>]’ (κάρτεϊ καὶ σθένεϊ σφετέρῳ)—such an idea is entertained at I.17.322—is an impossibility, since <em>kratos</em> ‘winning-power’ comes from the gods in the logic of Homeric diction. On this logic, see the comments on I.01.509 and I.11.317–319. </p>

<p>The news of the death of Patroklos is being poetically formulated here. This death is a <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’, I.17.688, which a god has ‘rolled’ down, as expressed by way of the verb <em>kulindein</em>, upon the Achaeans. See the comment on I.11.347, where we see that this pain is pictured as some boulder that has broken away from the heights above and is now about to crush anyone and anything that stands in the way. And what is this pain? It is the death of the ‘best of the Achaeans’, who is identified here as Patroklos, ritual substitute of Achilles. And the pain caused by this death will cause in turn a <em>pothē</em> ‘longing’ for the hero who has fallen. This noun <em>pothē</em> ‘longing’, like the verb <em>potheîn</em> ‘long for’, evokes the feelings of those who worship cult heroes: see the comment on I.02.695–709.  </p>

# Iliad 18.015–073

<p>At I.18.015–021, Achilles gets the grim news: that Patroklos has been killed by Hector, and that the fighting to recover his body, despoiled of the armor of Achilles, is still underway. Immediately, Achilles feels <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’, I.18.22. But the mourning and lamentation that is caused by this grief is aimed not only at Patroklos but also at Achilles in the narrative that follows, I.18.021–073. Within this narrative, Achilles gets to have his own wake, as it were. And the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that is now felt by Achilles will never leave him, even after he unsays his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ later on in <em>Iliad</em> 22. Unlike the goddess Demeter in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, for whom the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that she felt at verses 40 and 90 will go away at verse 436 as soon as she is reunited with Persephone, the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of Achilles will never go away. As Thetis the lamenting mother of Achilles declares at I.18.061–062, this hero will never again stop ‘grieving’, <em>akhnusthai</em>, I.18.062. From now on, Achilles will be <em>a man of constant sorrow</em> (on precedents for this expression, see <em>The Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, 1§54). See also the comments on I.09.249–250 and on I.23.046–047,</p>

# Iliad 18.51–60

<p>Thetis not only mourns her son Achilles as if he were already dead: she formally laments him in song. The wording of the verses spoken by Thetis here at I.18.051–060 corresponds morphologically to the wording of a song that could actually be sung as a lament. Leading her Nereid sisters, Thetis begins the singing at I.18.051, as signaled by the verb <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’, which indicates a performance by a lead performer in a song of lament performed by a group (see also PH 362). In this case, that group is represented by the Nereid sisters of Thetis. Such a performance involves not only singing but also a kinetic system of stylized movements—which is a kind of <em>dancing</em> that is integrated with the <em>singing</em>. On this point, see already the anchor comment on I.08.407–439. The movements of this kind of a kinetic system can be formalized by way of gestures such as swaying, tearing the cheeks, beating the chest, and so on, and it must be kept in mind that the <em>singing</em> of lament could regularly include the kind of stylized <em>dancing</em> that I describe here. As for the overall practice of singing this kind of lament, it is indicated here by a special word, <em>góos</em>, I.18.051. As we will see when we encounter further occurrences of this word, the <em>góos</em> is ordinarily sung only by relatives or close friends of the person who died. A typical theme in such a lament is what we see being sung by Thetis here at I.18.056–057, evoking the image of a tender young seedling that has tragically been cut down before its time.  </p>

# Iliad 18.070–071

<p>The grieving Achilles, shown lying prone here as if he himself were a corpse that needed to be mourned, is now held by the head from behind by her lamenting mother Thetis, Ι.18.071. This gesture re-enacts what typically happens at a real wake: the primary mourning woman will hold the head of the corpse from behind as she sings her song of lament. As we will see at I.24.724, such is the stance of Andromache when she cradles the head of her husband’s corpse while she sings her lament for him. See the comment on I.24.720–776. And the act of mourning performed by Thetis for Achilles here in <em>Iliad</em> 18 actually prefigures what will happen at the funeral of Achilles, which is of course not shown in the <em>Iliad</em>. At that funeral, which is shown only toward the end of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the corpse of Achilles will lie in state, and he will be mourned then by Thetis together with her Nereid sisters, O.24.058–059. Earlier in that narrative, as the corpse of Achilles is first seen lying in the dust after his death in battle, he is described there as larger than life in size, O.24.040: ‘you lay there, so huge in all your hugeness’ (κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί). So also Achilles here in the <em>Iliad</em> is now being pictured as lying in the dust, and he is described here too in the same way, I.18.026–027: ‘all stretched out, so huge in all his hugeness, he lay there’ (μέγας μεγαλωστί τανυσθεὶς | κεῖτο). So, Achilles is already being prefigured here as a corpse that is larger than life.  </p>

At that point, the Achaeans would surely recognize how much they needed Achilles. Now that this wish of Achilles has already been translated into the Will of Zeus, what is to happen next? That is the point of the question asked by Thetis, but of course the answer of Achilles will have to be framed in terms of the consequences resulting from his original wish. Now that Patroklos has been killed, what is Achilles to do?  </p>

# Iliad 18.219-221

<p>The word ἀριζήλη (<em>arizēlē</em> 'perspicuous'), whose repetition bridges tenor and vehicle in this simile, is an intensive form of the adjective δῆλος (<em>dēlos</em>), a word that is usually translated 'clear'. As the standard dictionaries and the etymological dictionaries say (see LSJ9 and Chantraine <em>DEG</em> s.vv.  δῆλος and ἀρίζηλος), it means 'clear' in a visual sense or in a logical sense, and in that respect, it is unlike the English word 'clear', which is also and unexceptionally used of sounds. In this passage, where the word <em>arizēlē</em> applies to a sound, <em>phōnē</em>, that issues from the mouth of Achilles and is echoed by the goddess Athena, we have a rare example of synesthesia in epic diction, a metaphor of visibility applied to a sound that is elaborated by a compressed simile that then goes ahead and visualizes a trumpet sounding when a city is besieged by its enemies. </p>

# Iliad 18.243-314

<p>At this assembly, Polydamas advocates a defensive strategy now that Achilles has re-entered the war. But Hector insists on a strategy of maintaining the offensive, and his opinion prevails. The Master Narrator comments: this was a bad decision by the assembly, to approve the strategy of Hector, since the goddess Athena had taken away from them their senses, that is, their <em>phrenes</em> ‘thinking’, I.18.311. If the assembly had been sensible, they would have recognized that Hector’s <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ had failed him, I.18.312. As noted in the comments on I.06.286–311, I.07.017–061, I.08.538–541, I.10.043–052, I.11.200, and I.13.825–829, there is a pattern of personal hostility felt by the goddess Athena toward Hector as a hero who aspires to some of the same qualities that Athena herself exemplifies. Like the goddess, Hector can be seen as an exponent of (1) defensive tactics in the warfare of protecting a citadel from sieges and (2) <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’—two qualities that are now tragically taken away from him when he most needs to have them in the macro-narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>.  </p>

<p>The particle <em>de</em> (δέ) of I.18.356 is syntactically correlated with the particle <em>men</em> (μέν) in a preceding verse, I.18.354. But a rhapsode (<em>rhapsōidos</em>) could begin his performance with the <em>de</em>-clause, thus “stranding,” as it were, the preceding <em>men</em>-clause. Here is an example, with reference to the performance of a rhapsode in the Ptolemaic era of Alexandria:  </p><p>καὶ ὁ μὲν ῥαψῳδὸς εὐθὺς ἦν διὰ στόματος πᾶσιν, ἐν τοῖς Πτολεμαίου γάμοις ἀγομένου τὴν ἀδελφὴν καὶ πρᾶγμα δρᾶν ἀλλόκοτον &lt;νομιζ&gt;ομένου καὶ ἄθεσμον ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπῶν ἐκείνων·</p><p>Ζεὺς δ᾿ Ἥρην ἐκάλεσσε κασιγνήτην ἄλοχόν τε [I.18.356] </p><p>The rhapsode [<em>rhapsōidos</em>] was the talk of everybody—the one who, at the wedding of Ptolemy who, in marrying his own sister was considered to be committing a deed unnatural and unholy, began with the following words: ‘And [<em>de</em>] Zeus summoned Hērā his sister, his wife’ [I.18.356] </p><p>Plutarch <em>Table Talk</em> 736e</p><p>The historical occasion is the wedding, in the first quarter of the third century before our era, of Ptolemy II Philadelphus to his sister, Arsinoe, in accordance with the practice of Egyptian pharaohs—and in violation of Hellenic practices. Evidently, then, the particle <em>de</em> could be used to begin a rhapsodic performance, even in contexts were such a use was dependent on a preceding <em>men</em>-clause. For an example of such a de at the beginning of a Homeric rhapsody, see the comment on O.03.001.  </p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, wishes correlated with premises

# Iliad 18.464–466

<p>Here is what the divine artisan wishes as he proceeds to make a new set of armor for Achilles: ‘|464 If only I could have the power to hide him from sorrowful death, |465 when his dreadful fate comes upon him |466 —as surely as there will be fine armor for him!’ (|464 αἲ γάρ μιν θανάτοιο δυσηχέος ὧδε δυναίμην |465 νόσφιν ἀποκρύψαι, ὅτε μιν μόρος αἰνὸς ἱκάνοι, |466 ὥς οἱ τεύχεα καλὰ παρέσσεται’). What follows is an epitome from GMP 296. Hephaistos is here wishing for something that is uncertain, and the wish is linked by the adverb <em>hōde</em> (ὧδε) ‘so’ with the conjunction <em>hōs</em> (ὡς) ‘as’ introducing an absolute certainty, that Achilles will have fine armor. In other words, the uncertainty of the wish, that Achilles be saved from death, is correlated with the certainty of the premise, that Achilles will have fine armor. I highlight the wording <em>ai gar</em> (αἲ γάρ + optative) ‘if only’, which expresses the wish, and the wording <em>hōde</em>… <em>hōs</em> (ὧδε…ὡς) ‘as surely as’, which connects this wish to the premise. We see here a parallelism with the wording <em>ei gar</em> (εἰ γάρ + optative) ‘if only’ when Hector expresses his wish to become an immortal, I.08.538 and I.13.825, and with the wording <em>hōs</em>/<em>houtō</em>…<em>hōs</em> (ὣς/οὕτω…ὡς) ‘as surely as’, which connects his wish to his premise as expressed at I.08.538-541 and I.13.825–828-that disaster will surely befall the Achaeans. In some cases, as in the three I have just highlighted, it sounds as if the speaker of the wish were expressing an obvious impossibility. But there are many cases where the wish being expressed is not at all meant to sound impossible: for an example, see I.04.313–314 and the comment there. Other such examples include O.03.218–220, O.14.440–441, O.15.341–342, O.17.494, O.17.496, O.18.235–240. For a more complicated example, see I.16.722–723 and the comment there. I save for a later comment some further examples.  </p>

tags: Ōkeanos as ring-composition, making new armor for Achilles, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, ring-composition

# Iliad 18.468-613

<p>The god Hephaistos makes a new set of metallic armor for Achilles to wear, replacing the older set that is now worn by Hector. The divine metalworker commences the work at I.18.468 and completes it at I.18.613. Then at I.18.614 the narrative announces that the overall work on the armor has now been completed. The metalwork itself is described as primarily bronzework, I.18.474, since bronze is the very first kind of metal that the god ‘was casting in the fire’ (ἐν πυρὶ βάλλεν), and then there are three secondary metals that are mentioned in succession at I.18.474–475: tin, gold, and silver. But bronze dominates the narrative. And the very first piece of armor to be made by the divine metalworker, as announced at I.18.478–479, is the <em>sakos</em> or ‘shield’, I.18.478, which is the centerpiece of the entire process of manufacturing the new set of armor for Achilles. The narrative that describes the <em>making of the shield</em>, which is already a description of <em>the shield in the making</em>, lasts from I.18.478 all the way to I.18.608. Then at I.18.609 the narrative announces that the work on the shield has now been completed. Just as the beginning of the narrative about the making of the shield announces the word <em>sakos</em> ‘shield’ at I.18.478, so also the ending that announces the completion of the work also announces again the same word <em>sakos</em> ‘shield’ at I.18.609, and thus the narrative has come full circle in a spectacular display of <em>ring-composition</em>. This ring-composition expresses here the circularity of the shield, but that circularity is also expressed by way of the adornment that encircles the shield. This adornment is the rim of the shield, presumably imagined as blue, and its encirclement of the shield is said to represent the cosmic river Ōkeanos, I.18.607–608. Such an encirclement of the shield by a representation of the Ōkeanos corresponds to the encirclement of the cosmos by the ever-circular flow of the Ōkeanos itself. See the comment on I.18.399. So, the correspondence shows that the shield in the making is in fact the cosmos in the making. As soon as the shield, as a narration in the making, is finally complete, the shield as an object in the making can finally be seen as a made object. What then follows at I.18.610–613 is the making of other parts of the armor: breastplate, helmet, greaves. And then comes the announcement at I.18.614, as already noted, that the work is now complete. Thus the beginning and the completion of the work on the shield, signaled in the ring-composition that starts at I.18.478 and comes full circle at I.18.608, is enveloped by a wider ring-composition that starts at I.18.468 and comes full circle at I.18.614.  </p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, making a new shield for Achilles

# Iliad 18.478-609

<p>As noted in the previous comment, which analyzes the wider narrative, the narrower narrative about the making of the shield begins at I.18.478 and comes full circle at I.18.608, followed by an announcement of the completion at I.18.609. For the wider narrative, see again the comment on I.18.468–613. As for the narrower narrative here, the analysis will require a different perspective. As the camera zooms in, as it were, on the world of images that are being worked into the surface of the shield by the divine metalworker Hephaistos, the artistic microcosm that we now see being pictured here represents a physical macrocosm that turns out to be the Homeric cosmos itself, defined by the world-encircling river Ōkeanos as its outer limit. The cosmic essence of this Ōkeanos, signaled at I.18.607–608, has already been analyzed in the earlier comment on I.18.468–613. Also, as noted in the still earlier comment on I.14.245–246–246a, the Homeric traditions about Ōkeanos coexisted with older traditions attributed to Orpheus, and, already in the ancient world, various interpreters developed various influential theories about the cosmos by viewing such Orphic traditions about the Ōkeanos together with the corresponding Homeric traditions. One such interpreter was Crates of Mallos, for whom the Ōkeanos was an essential part of an allegory about the cosmos: see the comment on I.14.245–246–246a. For Crates, his interpretation of the verses about the Ōkeanos at I.14.245–246–246a as a cosmic allegory was evidently coextensive with his interpretation of the verses about the shield being made for Achilles here at I.18.478–609. And there is a further extension: for Crates, the verses at I.11.032–040 about the images worked into the shield of Agamemnon were likewise a cosmic allegory: see the comment on I.11.032–040.  </p>

<p>The <em>antux</em> ‘rim’ that is being made for the shield of Achilles, mentioned here at I.18.479 and again at I.18.608, is <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’, I.18.480, and the outermost fold or circle of this <em>antux</em> is the Ōkeanos, I.18.608. For Crates, as noted in the comment on I.18.478–609, this design representing the Ōkeanos is part of an overall cosmic allegory. In Eustathius <em>Commentary on the Iliad</em> vol. 4 p. 218 lines 14–17, the commentator draws attention to the morphological parallelism of <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’ with <em>diplax</em> ‘twofold’, the second of which words refers at I.03.126 and at I.22.441 to a pattern-woven fabric. So, Eustathius recognizes here a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. On the <em>diplax</em>, see already the comment on I.03.125–128. The epithet for <em>antux</em> ‘rim’ as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ at I.18.480 is relevant, since the same word is attested as an epithet for the woven fabric that is called a <em>diplax</em> at both I.03.126 and I.22.441 in the medieval manuscript tradition. As we see from the attested medieval texts, the epithet <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ varies with <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ at both I.03.126 and I.22.441. For more on the interchangeable worlds of metalworking and weaving, see I.18.590 and the relevant comment on I.18.590–606.  </p>

And I now apply the technical term <em>ecphrasis</em> to this core narrative, by which I mean <em>the narration of visual</em>—<em>or at least visualized</em>—<em>art by way of verbal art</em>. From the start, I find it most noteworthy to report what we learn from the testimony of the scholia A for I.18.483: that Zenodotus of Ephesus (see under <em>Zenodotus</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas) athetized this entire ecphrasis, that is, all the verses that narrated, by way of verbal art, the visual or at least visualized narrative of the Shield, I.18.483–608. (On <em>athetesis</em> and <em>athetizing</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) But Zenodotus retained these verses in the base text of his edition. (On <em>base text</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas). We know this from the fact that Aristarchus, in his edition of Homer, reported a variant textual reading that had been attested by Zenodotus in the case of one of these athetized verses, I.18.499. See the comment below on I.18.499. By contrast with Zenodotus, an editor like Crates of Mallos considered the entire narrative of the Shield to be an all-important part of the <em>Iliad</em> writ large: see the comment on I.18.478–609. </p>

# Iliad 18.587-589

<p>In this compressed pastoral scene, we see at I.18.589 three important words referring to places where herdsmen can shelter their herds: <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’; <em>klisiā</em> ‘shelter’; <em>sēkos</em> ‘enclosure’. In what follows, I epitomize from my analysis of these three words in HPC 152–153. All three of these words are applied here in the context of describing a generic pastoral setting. When we compare the etymologies of these three words with the contexts of their usage in other pastoral settings, we find that their reconstructed meanings are interrelated: <em>stathmos</em>, derived from the root <em>*sta-</em> meaning ‘stand up’, is the makeshift post of a herdsman’s shelter or tent; <em>klisiā</em>, derived from the root <em>*kli-</em> meaning ‘lie down’ or ‘lean’, is the space in the shelter where the herdsman reclines—or, alternatively, it is a ‘lean-to’ covering that affords a makeshift shelter; and <em>sēkos</em>, derived from the root <em>*sak-</em> meaning ‘fill [an empty space]’, is the enclosure where the herdsman’s herd is penned in. By way of metonymy, the <em>klisiā</em> is not only an aspect of the shelter but also the entire shelter; likewise, the <em>stathmos</em> is not only the post of the shelter but also the entire shelter and everything contiguous with the shelter, including the <em>sēkos</em>. In this sense, then, the <em>stathmos</em> is the herdsman’s ‘station’. The pastoral word <em>sēkos</em> refers not only to the enclosure where a herd is penned in but also to the enclosure where a cult hero is entombed and worshipped. And it can be argued that such sacral connotations are attached to the pastoral words klisiā and stathmos as well. All three words connote traditional images typical of cult heroes. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the word <em>klisiā</em> refers to the abode that a hero like Achilles frequents in life: his <em>klisiā</em> is his shelter, which marks the place where his ship is beached on the shores of the Hellespont during the Trojan War, as we see at I.08.224, I.11.007, and so on. See the comments on I.08.227–227 and on I.11.005–016. In later poetry we see a related use of <em>stathmos</em> (plural <em>stathma</em>) with reference to the places where the ships of Achaean heroes are beached on the shores of the Hellespont (“Euripides” Rhesus 43); these places are also called <em>naustathma</em> ‘ship stations’ (<em>Rhesus</em> 136, 244, 448, 582, 591, 602, 673). Among these <em>stathma</em> ‘stations’ lining the coast of the Hellespont is the heroic space occupied by Achilles.  </p>

This vision of Homer as a performer predates the later vision of Homer as a reciter of epic verses. In this older vision, Homer sings to the accompaniment of a lyre, and he is not only a soloist: he can lead the singing and dancing performed by a choral group. The word for ‘choral group’ in Greek is <em>khoros</em>, which refers to an ensemble of performers who dance as well as sing—unlike the English borrowing <em>chorus</em>, which refers exclusively to an ensemble of singers. And that is why the word <em>khoros</em> here at I.18.603 refers to the combined singing and dancing that we now see being performed by a festive ensemble of unmarried young women and men. But the same word <em>khoros</em> can also refer to the setting for such singing and dancing, as we see at I.18.590. That is, <em>khoros</em> can refer to the actual place where the singing and dancing happens, and, at I.18.591–592, that place is compared by way of simile to a ritual setting that had been constructed once upon a time in the city of Knossos on the island of Crete. That setting, known in other traditions as the <em>Labyrinth</em>, had been constructed by the prototypical artisan Daedalus for the princess Ariadne, daughter of Minos the king of Knossos. Myth has it that Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, king of Knossos in Crete, who dominated the Aegean Sea as the mighty ruler of the prototypical Minoan Empire: see Nagy 2015.08.26, 2015.09.03, 2015.09.10, 2015.09.17, 2015.09.24. So, the setting that was figured by the divine artisan Hephaistos for the performance of Homer is being compared at I.18.591–592 to a setting that had been figured by the prototypical human artisan Daedalus for a choral performance that had once taken place in the Bronze Age of Minos and Ariadne. For more on Ariadne, see the comment on O.15.001–009. It is as if the choral setting figured by Daedalus the human were a prefiguration of the choral setting figured by Hephaistos the god. But such an impression is an illusion. The god is of course timeless, and his metalwork is an art that must be synchronized with the art of Homer in refiguring what Hephaistos is figuring. For the sake of enhancing the verbal art that refigures the visual art of Hephaistos, the visual art of Daedalus can be envisioned as a precedent. And this art of Daedalus is a most prestigious precedent for Homeric poetry, going back as it does all the way to the Bronze Age. Moreover, the synchronization of the god’s art with Homeric art makes it possible for the god’s art of metalworking to be versatile enough to be comparable to still other prestigious forms of art. A shining example is the Homeric use of <em>poikillein</em> ‘pattern-weave’ at I.18.590 in referring to the metalwork of Hephaistos in figuring the choral scene. We see here once again a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. See the previous comment on I.18.479–480 and the following comment on I.18.590. Such a crossover is also evident in the myths and rituals that were central to the festival of the goddess Hērā at Argos. In terms of local Argive traditions, the pictures that were metalworked by Hephaistos into the original Shield of Achilles were the same as the pictures that were pattern-woven into the patos or ‘robe’ (Hesychius, under πάτος) that was presented to the goddess in the context of choral singing and dancing performed by celebrants at her festival (Callimachus <em>Aetia</em> F 66; scholia for Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 7.152; Euripides <em>Electra</em> 432–477).  </p>

# Iliad 18.590

<p>At I.18.479–480, we saw a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalworking and weaving. The metalwork of Hephaistos in manufacturing the Shield of Achilles was metaphorized as the pattern-weaving of fabric. There is a comparable crossover here at I.18.590, where the word <em>poikillein</em> ‘pattern-weave’ refers to the metalwork performed by the god Hephaistos in making the Shield of Achilles. Here I epitomize my relevant analysis in HC C§15, where I focus on a comparable crossover in the case of Virgil’s Shield of Aeneas in <em>Aeneid</em> 8. I start by focusing on <em>arma</em> ‘armor, arms’, which is the first word at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616. To be compared is the beginning of the epic, at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1: arma virumque cano ‘armor I sing, and the man’. When we read <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616, where the narrative refers to the <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ of Aeneas, the description of this hero’s Shield as a shield has not yet happened. So far, only the armor in general is being described. But there is more to it: the word <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ at Aeneid 8.616, by way of cross-referring to the initial use of <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1, stands metonymically for the whole epic, not only for the ‘armor’ of Aeneas. The <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ at the beginning of <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1 can apply at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616 if we understand the deployment of <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1 as a masterstroke of metonymy. What is being signaled by the <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616 is a description of the Shield that becomes coextensive with the overall narration of the epic that is the <em>Aeneid</em> in its entirety. But when the actual description of the Shield begins at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.625, the wording makes it clear that this description defies any immediate narration: clipei non enarrabile textum ‘the shield, the weaving [textus] of which is beyond all power to narrate’. To describe the cosmic power of the Shield’s meaning will require an overall epic narration, from beginning to end, which cannot be successful until the story is fully told. Such a narration calls for a metaphor to substitute for the narration: instead of a tale that is being told, the narration is reconfigured as a ‘web’ that is being woven, a textus. The story has to be told from beginning to end, just as a web has to be woven from beginning to end.  </p>

# Iliad 18.603-606

<p>A convergence of visual narration as pattern-woven into a fabric and as metalworked into bronze is re-enacted in the picture that I am about to analyze.</p>
<p>This picture, metalworked into the surface of the Shield of Achilles in Iliad XVIII, is a Homeric masterpiece of ekphrasis. I have in mind here the most basic sense of this technical term ekphrasis, which is, an imitation of visual art by verbal art. In this case, the verbal art of poetry performs a narration that was supposedly performed by the visual art of metalwork in bronze. And the poetry visualizes the performer of this narration as none other than the god of metalwork himself, the divine smith Hephaistos, whose primary medium of metalwork is bronze, as we know from the Homeric description of the god as a khalkeus ‘bronzeworker’ (Iliad XV 309).</p>
<p>The performance of metalwork by Hephaistos, as we will see, is expressed by way of a powerful metaphor: in the extract that I am about to quote from Iliad XVIII, the god’s act of metalworking his narration into a surface of bronze is compared to an act of pattern-weaving that same narration into the substance of a fabric, as if he were making a peplos. And the word here for ‘pattern-weaving’ is poikillein, which occurs in the very first line of my quoted extract:</p>
<p>4-A</p>
<p>|<sub>590</sub> The renowned one [= Hephaistos], the one with the two strong arms, pattern-wove [poikillein]<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> into it [= the Shield of Achilles] a place for singing-and-dancing [khoros].<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> |<sub>591</sub> It [= the khoros] was just like the one that, once upon a time in far-ruling Knossos, |<sub>592</sub> Daedalus made for Ariadne, the one with the beautiful tresses [plokamoi]. |<sub>593</sub> There were young men there,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and young women who are courted with gifts of cattle, |<sub>594</sub> and they all were dancing [orkheîsthai] with each other, holding hands at the wrist. |<sub>595</sub> The girls were wearing delicate dresses, while the boys were clothed in tunics [khitōn plural] |<sub>596</sub> well woven, gleaming exquisitely, with a touch of olive oil. |<sub>597</sub> The girls had beautiful garlands [stephanai], while the boys had knives |<sub>598</sub> made of gold, hanging from knife-belts made of silver. |<sub>599</sub> Half the time they moved fast in a circle, with expert steps, |<sub>600</sub> showing the greatest ease, as when a wheel, solidly built, is given a spin by the hands |<sub>601</sub> of a seated potter, who is testing it whether it will run well. |<sub>602</sub> The other half of the time they moved fast in straight lines, alongside each other. |<sub>603</sub> A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [khoros] that rouses desire, |<sub>604</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai];<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>605</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx];<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> two special dancers [kubistētēre] among them |<sub>606</sub> were swirling as he led [ex-arkhein]<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> the singing-and-dancing [molpē] in their midst.</p>
<p>Iliad XVIII 590-606<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 604.</p>
<p>In contemplating this picture, the mind’s eye sees the metalwork executed by the god Hephaistos, that ultimate bronzeworker: as I have already noted, that is what Hephaistos is actually called by Homeric poetry, a khalkeus ‘bronzeworker’ (Iliad XV 309). Metaphorically, however, the actual epic narration of the Shield in the Iliad is figured not only as metalwork, specifically as bronzework, but also as pattern-weaving: we have just seen the decisive word, poikillein, in the first line of the extract I just quoted (XVIII 590).</p>
<p>♢Back to pattern-weaving as a metaphor for Homeric poetry</p>
<p>The craft of pattern-weaving is especially privileged as a metaphor for the craft of metalworking, since it is also a metaphor for the craft of making Homeric poetry, as we saw in Part Two when we considered the Iliadic passages picturing the web that was pattern-woven by Andromache, quoted in Extract 2-O, and the web that was pattern-woven by Helen, quoted in Extract 2-P. Virgil understood this privileging of the metaphor of pattern-weaving: in the Aeneid, the metalwork of the divine smith Vulcan in producing the Shield of Aeneas is described there as an act of weaving a ‘web’, a textus (Aeneid 8.625).<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>So, the ekphrasis of the Shield of Achilles in Iliad XVIII is one step removed from a metaphor for Homeric poetry, since the metaphor that compares the metalworking of this Shield to the pattern-weaving of a web can be seen as an ingenious substitution for the metaphor that compares the making of Homeric poetry itself to this same privileged process of pattern-weaving.</p>
<p>♢Pattern-weaving Homer himself into his own web</p>
<p>Having just considered again the centrality of pattern-weaving as a metaphor for the verbal art of Homeric poetry, this time in the context of lines 590-606 in Iliad XVIII, quoted in Extract 4-A, I now take a closer look at lines 603-606 in that same extract. We find in these four lines something we see nowhere else in texts of the Iliad as they have survived into our time. Right in the center of the festive scene that is pattern-woven into the metaphorical web of pictures created by Homeric poetry is a singer who is none other than Homer himself.</p>
<p>Perhaps this Homer is not the kind of Homer we may have expected to find, but here he is, for all to see. That is what I will now argue.</p>
<p>♢Homer as a lead singer</p>
<p>In arguing that the singer we see in lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII is meant to be Homer himself, I start by focusing on the fact that this singer is shown here in the act of taking the lead in the performance of a khoros. This word khoros means ‘chorus’ in the sense of a singing-and-dancing group.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a> I quickly add here in passing that I have started to use hyphens in saying singing-and-dancing, but I will postpone till a later point my rationale for using such a format.</p>
<p>To reword my argument in terms of this meaning of khoros ‘chorus’ as a singing-and-dancing group, I am saying that Homer in the present context is imagined as a lead singer who participates in the singing-and-dancing of such a choral group. In making this argument, I will highlight five words that we find in lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII. I start by quoting again these four lines:</p>
<p>4-B (four lines re-quoted from 4-A)</p>
<p>|<sub>603</sub> A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [khoros] that rouses desire, |<sub>604</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai]; in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>605</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx];<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a> two special dancers [kubistētēre] among them |<sub>606</sub> were swirling as he led [ex-arkhein]<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a> the singing-and-dancing [molpē] in their midst.</p>
<p>Iliad XVIII 603-606<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 604.</p>
<p>I have already indicated, in the special note immediately above, the first of the five words that especially concern me in Extract 4-B here, which is terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 604. But I am not yet ready to explain my reasons for highlighting this word.</p>
<p>So, without any further explanation for now, I proceed to the second of the five words that I highlight here, which is the noun khoros ‘chorus’ at line 603. In general, as I have already observed with reference to an earlier occurrence of khoros, at line 590 as quoted in Extract 4-A, this word can refer not only to a choral group of singers-and-dancers but also to the place where the singing-and-dancing happens, and the relationship of the place to the group inside that place is a fine example of synecdoche: the place for the grouping is seen as the grouping itself. And, to return to my translation of line 603, the word khoros in this context can refer not only to a singing-and-dancing group but also to the place where the group is performing.</p>
<p>The third and the fourth words that I highlight here in lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII are the verb melpesthai at line 604 and the noun molpē at line 606: both of these words, as we know from other contexts, refer to the combined activities of singing and dancing in a khoros or choral group.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a> Because these words melpesthai and molpē combine the idea of singing with the idea of dancing, I will consistently translate them in a hyphenated format, ‘singing-and-dancing’. In fact, I have been using this format from the start in defining the word khoros as a ‘singing-and-dancing group’, in order to highlight the fact that this Greek word khoros, unlike the borrowed English word chorus, includes dance.</p>
<p>The fifth and last word that I highlight in this passage is the verb ex-arkhein at line 606, which signals an individuated act of performance that interacts with the collective performance of a khoros as a singing-and-dancing group.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p>I now offer an overall interpretation of Iliad XVIII 603-606, as just quoted in Extract 4-B, in which these five words occur. I focus on the picturing of an individuated singer who is singing while playing on a phorminx, which is a special kind of lyre. He is flanked by two individuated dancers, kubistētēre. The three of them are surrounded by a choral group of radiant young men and women who are not only dancing but also evidently singing, as we see from the contexts of the words khoros at line 603 and melpesthai / molpē at lines 604 /606. The lead singer himself is not only singing but also dancing - or at least he is participating in the overall choral dancing, as we see again from the contexts of the words melpesthai / molpē at lines 604 /606. So, this lead singer too is part of the overall khoros. And all of them - the lead singer together with the choral group - are performing to the delight of a huge crowd. Here I come back to the programmatic word terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 604.</p>
<p>I said a while ago that Homer, as pattern-woven into the metaphorical web created by Homeric poetry, is here for all to see. But now I must add a major qualification. The fact is, Homer is “here” only in one version of the Homeric textual tradition. We will now consider an alternative version - and this version is the one that actually survives in the medieval manuscripts - where we see no Homer at all. I now show the text of this alternative version:</p>
<p>4-C (three lines different in meaning from the four lines quoted in 4-B)</p>
<p>|<sub>603</sub> A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [khoros] that rouses desire, |<sub>604</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai]; in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>605</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx];<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a> two special dancers [kubistētēre] among them |<sub>606</sub> were swirling as they led [ex-arkhein]<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> the singing-and-dancing [molpē] in their midst.</p>
<p>Iliad XVIII 603-606<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 604.</p>
<p>A part of the wording here - the part that I indicate with a double strikethrough - is not attested in the medieval manuscript tradition: ‘|<sub>604</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai]; in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>605</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx]; two special dancers [kubistētēre] among them |<sub>606 </sub>…’.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> This missing part in Iliad XVIII 603-606 was restored by Friedrich August Wolf in his 1804 edition of the Iliad, and the relevant line-numbering 604-605 in current editions of the Iliad reflects that restoration, going back to the edition of Wolf.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> The restoration, as I call it, is based on what we read in a source that dates back to the late second century CE, Athenaeus (his relevant text can be found at 5.180c-e, 181a-f).<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> From this source, we learn about the treatment of Iliad XVIII 603-606 in the Homeric text edited by Aristarchus, whose editorial work can be dated to the middle of the second century BCE. As we learn from Athenaeus (5.181c), Aristarchus rejected as un-Homeric the part of the wording that I have translated this way: ‘|<sub>604</sub> … in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>605</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx] … |<sub>606 </sub>…’.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> But, as we also learn from Athenaeus (again 5.181c), Aristarchus did not reject the same wording in another Homeric context, at Odyssey iv 17-18, where we read once again: ‘|<sub>17</sub> … in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>18</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx] … |<sub>19 </sub>…’.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> And, in fact, this wording is preserved for Odyssey iv 17-18 in the medieval manuscript tradition.</p>
<p>I quote here the full context of the passage I just cited from the Odyssey:</p>
<p>4-D</p>
<p>|<sub>15 </sub>So they feasted throughout the big palace with its high ceilings, |<sub>16</sub> both the neighbors and the kinsmen of glorious Menelaos, |<sub>17</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai]; in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] a divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>18</sub> playing on the special lyre [phorminx]; two special dancers [kubistētēre] among them |<sub>19</sub> were swirling as he led [ex-arkhein]<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a> the singing-and-dancing [molpē] in their midst.</p>
<p>Odyssey iv 15-19<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 17.</p>
<p>I just quoted the reading ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos), indicated by Athenaeus (5.180d, 5.181d) both for this line, at Odyssey iv 19, and for the line at Iliad XVIII 606.<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> With regard to this reading, Athenaeus (5.180d) also indicates that the editor Aristarchus and his followers had accepted an alternative reading ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes) at Odyssey iv 19 - as also in Iliad XVIII 606.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> In fact, it is this alternative reading (ex-arkhontes) that we find preserved in the medieval manuscripts of both the Iliad and the Odyssey. Still, as the wording of Athenaeus indicates further, his own preferred reading ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) existed in ancient times as a textual variant that had been noted by Aristarchus - even though that editor preferred the alternative textual variant ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes).</p>
<p>I focus here on the methodology of Aristarchus in making these judgments. Here was a scholar whom the ancient world generally acclaimed as the greatest of all experts in the editing of the Homeric texts. His working procedure was to track variations in the Homeric textual tradition by collating manuscripts that were available to him - and then to publish in his hupomnēmata or ‘commentaries’ his scholarly judgments in choosing which textual variants were authentically Homeric and which ones were supposedly not.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> In the case of line 606 in Iliad XVIII, I argue, we are dealing with two textual variants that were known to Aristarchus, ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) and ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes); in his commentaries, he evidently expressed his judgment that the second of these variants was authentically Homeric while the first was supposedly un-Homeric.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a> Then, about 350 years later, Athenaeus seized an opportunity to show off his own learning by criticizing this particular judgment of Aristarchus about the two textual variants, arguing that the authentically Homeric version is really the first one, ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) and not the second one, ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes). In the larger context of the passage where this line 606 occurs, that is, in lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII, Aristarchus had evidently found a related textual variation, in the form of a longer four-line version as quoted in Extract 4-B and a shorter three-line version as quoted in Extract 4-C. In the case of these lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII, Aristarchus judged the shorter three-line textual variant of this passage to be the authentically Homeric one. And the three-line variant requires the reading ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes), since there exists in this version no singular referent to which the alternative reading ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) could refer. Only in the case of the four-line variant could there be room for allowing either the reading ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes), with the plural referent, or the reading ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos), with the singular referent. In this case, it all depends on whether the leading of the chorus is ascribed respectively to the one singer or to the two dancers. And, here again, Aristarchus is criticized for his judgment by Athenaeus, who argues on the basis of comparable contexts that only a singer can lead off a choral performance, not dancers. In terms of this criticism, only the longer four-line version could be authentic, and, even in this case, such a longer version would require the reading ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos), which refers to the singer, since the reading ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes) would be simply wrong.</p>
<p>In terms of my argument, however, the authenticity of the longer version does not rule out the possibility that the shorter version is also authentic. As we will see, both versions can be authenticated. And what really matters, I argue, is that Aristarchus in the course of his collating Homeric manuscripts could verify here the existence of both a longer and a shorter textual variant, and that he makes note of the variation itself in his commentaries.<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a> What Athenaeus is criticizing here is simply the judgment of Aristarchus in preferring one textual variant instead of another. But the fact is, if Aristachus had not mentioned two variants in this case, Athenaeus would have had nothing to criticize.</p>
<p>More important for now, both of the textual variants at line 606 of Iliad XVIII, ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) and ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes), can be shown to be formulaic variants as well.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a> To say it more forcefully, the existence of these forms as textual variants was determined by their pre-existence as formulaic variants.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean. The form and the meaning of both variants can be explained in terms of variations that existed in the formulaic system of the Homeric language, which stemmed from an oral poetic tradition and thus did not depend on the technology of writing for either the composition or the performance of Homeric poetry. Just as any language is a system, so also the special language of Homeric poetry was a system, albeit a specialized one, and therefore this special language has to be analyzed as a system in its own right. The basic formal components of this system are known as formulas, and that is why I describe Homeric poetry in terms of a formulaic system. In using these terms formulas and formulaic system, I follow the lead of Milman Parry and Albert Lord, who perfected a methodology for analyzing the textual tradition of Homeric poetry in terms of the formulaic system underlying the textualization of this poetry.<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p>So, applying the approach of Parry and Lord, I am arguing that the variants ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos) and ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes), attested in Odyssey iv 19 and in Iliad XVIII 606, are independent of the Homeric textual tradition and depend instead on pre-existing variations that derive from the formulaic system of Homeric poetry.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a></p>
<p>These two variants, I will now go on to argue, stem from two different narrative scenarios corresponding to the longer and the shorter versions of the wording transmitted for lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII. According to the shorter version as signaled by ‘as they led’ (ex-arkhontes) at line 606, which is the reading I quote in Extract 4-C, it is the two individuated dancers whose performance leads into the choral singing-and-dancing. According to the longer version as signaled by ‘as he led’ (ex-arkhontos), which is the reading I quote in Extract 4-B, the individuated singer combines his performance with the corresponding performance of two individuated dancers who flank him as he leads into the choral singing-and-dancing.</p>
<p>These two scenarios both resemble, in different ways, what happens in Odyssey viii when Demodokos the blind singer performs the second of his three songs:</p>
<p>4-E</p>
<p>|<sub>250</sub> [Alkinoos is speaking.] “Let’s get started. I want the best of the Phaeacian acrobatic dancers [bētarmones] |<sub>251</sub> to perform their sportive dance [paizein],<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> so that the stranger, our guest, will be able to tell his near-and-dear ones, |<sub>252</sub> when he gets home, how much better we (Phaeacians) are than anyone else |<sub>253</sub> in sailing and in footwork, in dance [orkhēstus] and song [aoidē]. |<sub>254</sub> One of you go and get for Demodokos the clear-sounding special lyre [phorminx], |<sub>255</sub> bringing it to him. It is in the palace somewhere.” |<sub>256</sub> Thus spoke Alkinoos, the one who looks like the gods, and the herald [kērux] got up, |<sub>257</sub> ready to bring the well carved phorminx from the palace of the king. |<sub>258</sub> And the organizers [aisumnētai], the nine selectmen, all got up |<sub>259</sub> - they belonged to the district [dēmos] - and they started arranging everything according to the rules of the competition [agōn]: |<sub>260</sub> they made smooth the place of the singing-and-dancing [khoros], and they made a wide space of competition [agōn]. |<sub>261</sub> The herald [kērux] came near, bringing the clear-sounding phorminx |<sub>262</sub> for Demodokos. He moved to the center [es meson] of the space. At his right and at his left were boys [kouroi] |<sub>263</sub> in the first stage of adolescence [prōthēboi], standing there, well versed in dancing [orkhēthmos]. |<sub>264</sub> They pounded out with their feet a dance [khoros], a thing of wonder, and Odysseus |<sub>265</sub> was observing the sparkling footwork. He was amazed in his heart [thūmos]. |<sub>266</sub> And he [= Demodokos], playing on the phorminx [phormizein], started [anaballesthai] singing beautifully |<sub>267</sub> about [amphi] the bonding [philotēs] of Ares and of Aphrodite, the one with the beautiful garlands [stephanoi], |<sub>268</sub> about how they, at the very beginning,<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a> mated with each other in the palace of Hephaistos, |<sub>269</sub> in secret. [The story that has just started at line 266 now continues, ending at line 366.] |<sub>367</sub> These things, then, the singer [aoidos] was singing [aeidein], that very famous singer. As for Odysseus, |<sub>368</sub> he felt delight [terpesthai] in his heart as he was listening - and so too did all the others feel, |<sub>369</sub> the Phaeacians, those men with their long oars, men famed for their ships.</p>
<p>Odyssey viii 250-269, 367-369<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 368.</p>
<p>I paraphrase what we have just seen narrated here, in the larger context of Odyssey viii 248-380.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a> To start, a special lyre called the phorminx is brought to Demodokos (lines 254, 257), and then he proceeds es meson ‘to the center’ (262) of the space where the performance is to take place; that space is a khoros ‘chorus’ (260) - and we have already seen that this word can refer both to a singing-and-dancing group and to the place where the group performs. This space has been smoothed over (260), and it is enveloped by a wider overall space that is marked out for accommodating a vast assembly of people attending what is described here as a competitive event. The one word that is used in this context to express two meanings, both ‘assembly of people’ and ‘competitive event’, is agōn (259 and 260). Participating in this competitive event of choral performance are the young men of the Phaeacians, who are described as specially skilled performers at such events (248-253); among the words that we see in this description are khoroi ‘choruses’ (248), orkhēstus ‘dancing’ (253), and aoidē ‘singing’ (253). Also participating in this competitive event is the singer in the center, Demodokos himself. When this singer makes his way es meson ‘to the center’ (again, 262) of the space set aside for the performance, he is surrounded by kouroi ‘boys’ (262) whose nimble feet are already pounding out the rhythm of the song on the surface of the space set aside for singing-and-dancing. And the word for this space here again is khoros (264). Meanwhile the singer starts ‘singing’, aeidein (266), while accompanying himself on the special lyre called the phorminx (266). His song, about the love affair of Ares and Aphrodite, is now retold, and the retelling takes one hundred lines exactly within the framing narrative of the Odyssey: he starts at 266 and ends at 366. So, what is the reaction of the disguised Odysseus, who is the primary character attending this performance of Demodokos? The answer is, as we see in the text as I quoted it here in Extract 4-E, Odysseus terpeto ‘felt delight’ (368), and the same delighted reaction was experienced, it is said, by everyone else attending the performance (368-369). Then the virtuoso song of this individuated singer Demodokos leads into a virtuoso performance by two individuated dancers (370-379). Responding to these dancers in choral performance are the rest of the kouroi ‘boys’ (379-380).</p>
<p>So, in the formulaic wording that I have just paraphrased from Odyssey viii, we find a wealth of free-standing comparative evidence that I can cite in support of authenticating both the longer and the shorter versions of lines 603-606 in Iliad XVIII, as quoted respectively in Extract 4-B and Extract 4-C. These two different versions, I argue, would have suited two different eras in the evolution of Homeric poetry as a formulaic system. In an earlier era, Homer would have been appreciated as a lead singer who could interact with choral singing-and-dancing; in a later era, by contrast, he would be a solo singer, and so he could no longer fit into a festive scene of choral performance.</p>
<p>For the moment, I highlight one detail that stands out in the longer and older version of lines 603-606 in Iliad XVIII as quoted in Extract 4-B: there is an individuated lead singer here, flanked by two individuated dancers, and this picture matches closely what we see in Odyssey viii 370-379, which likewise shows an individuated lead singer flanked by two individuated dancers. Conversely, the focus on the two individuated dancers instead of the one individuated singer in this part of the description in Odyssey viii 370-379 is comparable to what we see in the shorter and newer version of lines 603-606 in Iliad XVIII, quoted in Extract 4-C, where the figure of the lead singer is occluded - and thus excluded from any possibility of interacting with the choral performance that is being described.</p>
<p>Pursuing further my argument that the Iliad, like the Odyssey, shows a lead singer whose performance interacts with choral singing-and-dancing, I now come to a new piece of evidence. We see it in Odyssey xiii, where the singer Demodokos performs one last song before Odysseus leaves the land of the Phaeacians. The occasion is most festive, marking the conclusion of the overall festivities that had started in Odyssey viii - and had continued ever since then. Bringing these festivities to a spectacular close, Alkinoos the king of the Phaeacians slaughters a sacrificial ox to the god Zeus, and this animal sacrifice is the cue for Demodokos to emerge once again as the lead singer in the midst of a festive crowd:</p>
<p>4-F</p>
<p>|<sub>24</sub> On their [= the Phaeacians’] behalf Alkinoos, the one with the holy power, sacrificed an ox |<sub>25</sub> to Zeus, the one who brings dark clouds, the son of Kronos, and he rules over all. |<sub>26</sub> Then, after burning the thigh-pieces, they feasted, feasting most gloriously, |<sub>27</sub> and they were feeling delight [terpesthai]; in their midst sang-and-danced [melpesthai] the divine singer [aoidos], |<sub>28</sub> Demodokos, honored by the people.</p>
<p>Odyssey xiii 24-28<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 27.</p>
<p>We see here in line 27 of Odyssey xiii exactly the same wording that we saw in line 17 of Odyssey iv, quoted in Extract 4-D. More important, we see the same wording also in line 604 of Iliad XVIII, quoted in Extract 4-B and already in Extract 4-A, that is, in the line that shows a part of the longer version of Iliad XVIII 603-606 as restored by Wolf. In each one of these three lines that I just listed, Odyssey xiii 27 and iv 17 and Iliad XVIII 604, a solo singer is shown, but the individuated soloist is leading into a choral song combined with dance, as signaled by the word melpesthai in all three contexts. This word, as we have seen, combines the idea of singing with the idea of dancing - that is, choral dancing. That is why I have translated melpesthai all along in a hyphenated format, ‘singing-and-dancing’.</p>
<p>The passage I have just quoted in Extract 4-F from Odyssey xiii 24-28 is a most decisive piece of comparative evidence validating the authenticity of the corresponding passage in the longer version of Iliad XVIII 603-606, quoted earlier in Extract 4-B and even earlier in Extract 4-A. Both of these two passages show an individuated lead singer in the midst of a festive crowd surrounding a choral performance that brings delight to all. Both in Odyssey xiii 27 and in Iliad XVIII 604, the decisive word that shows the interaction of the individuated lead singer with choral performance is melpesthai ‘sing-and-dance’.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> But the passage in Odyssey xiii 24-28 occludes any direct mention of dancers, thus differing from the corresponding passage in the longer version of Iliad XVIII 603-606, which highlights two individuated dancers as well as a chorus. Conversely, the passage in the shorter version of Iliad XVIII 603-606, quoted earlier in Extract 4-C, occludes any direct mention of a singer, thus differing from the corresponding passage in Odyssey xiii 24-28, quoted just now in Extract 4-F, which highlights Demodokos as an individuated lead singer.</p>
<p>The decisive evidence of this passage in Odyssey xiii 24-28 is missing from the reportage of Athenaeus (5.181c) about the editorial decisions of Aristarchus concerning Odyssey iv 15-19 and Iliad XVIII 603-606. And it is missing also from the argumentations of those who build theories about various kinds of textual interpolation; according to one such theory, for example, the longer version of Iliad XVIII 604-605 results from some kind of “rhapsodic intervention,” which supposedly happened at some undetermined stage in the history the Homeric textual tradition.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a> The problem with this kind of theorizing is that it fails to account for the formulaic nature of such an “intervention.”<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a> As we have seen by now, the evidence of the wording in Iliad XVIII 604-605 indicates that both the shorter and the longer versions result from formulaic variation.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a></p>
<p>♢Homer as the lead singer of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo</p>
<p>So far, I have highlighted three Homeric passages, two of them in the Odyssey and one in the Iliad, where we see a lead singer interacting with the performance of a choral group. Now we turn to the Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo, where we are about to see once again a lead singer in the act of interacting with a choral performance. And, in this case, we have evidence from the historical period that the lead singer was actually recognized as Homer himself, as we learn from the explicit testimony of the historian Thucydides:</p>
<p>4-G</p>
<p>|<sub>3.104.2</sub> … After the ritual purification [of the sacred island of Delos], the Athenians at that point for the first time turned the festival known as the Delia into a quadrennial [instead of an annual] festival. |<sub>3.104.3</sub> Even in the remote past, there had been at Delos a great [annual] coming together of Ionians and neighboring islanders [nēsiōtai], and they were celebrating [ἐθεώρουν ‘were making theōriā’] along with their wives and children, just as the Ionians in our own times come together [= at Ephesus] for [the festival of] the Ephesia. A competition [agōn] was held there [= in Delos], both in athletics and in mousikē (tekhnē),<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a> and the cities brought choruses [khoroi]. |<sub>3.104.4</sub> Homer makes it most clear that such was the case in the following verses [epos plural], which come from a prooimion<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a> of Apollo:</p>
<p>[[beginning of quotation by Thucydides]] |<sub>146</sub> But when, O Phoebus [Apollo], in Delos more than anywhere else you feel delight [terpesthai] in your heart [thūmos], |<sub>147</sub> there the Ionians, with tunics [khitōn plural] trailing, gather |<sub>148</sub> with their children and their wives, along the causeway [aguia],<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a> |<sub>149</sub> and there with boxing [pugmakhiē] and dancing [orkhēstus] and song [aoidē] |<sub>150</sub> they have you in mind and make you feel delight [terpein], whenever they set up a competition [agōn].

<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the contexts of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at lines 146 and 170 of the Homeric Hymn as quoted here.</p>
<p>The two sequences of verses here, as quoted by Thucydides and as attributed by him to Homer himself as the speaker of these verses, correspond to the following sequences of verses transmitted by the medieval manuscript traditions of the Homeric Hymn (3)<em> to Apollo</em>:</p>

<p>Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo 165-172<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 170.</p>
<p>At line 171 of this version as we find it in the medieval manuscript tradition, I show the variant reading aph’ hēmeōn (ἀφ’ ἡμέων). There are other corresponding variant readings also attested in the manuscripts, but I single out this one because it is comparable in its formulaic function to the variant reading aphēmōs (ἀφήμως) that we have already seen in the version quoted by Thucydides. I translate the variant reading aph’ hēmeōn (ἀφ’ ἡμέων) as ‘about me’, to be contrasted with the variant reading aphēmōs (ἀφήμως), which I translated as meaning ‘without naming names’. As I will argue, both aph’ hēmeōn and aphēmōs are authentic formulaic variants, and both of them are relevant to the role of Homer as lead singer. In both versions, as we will see, the context is opaque and riddling.</p>
<p>♢The riddling of Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo</p>
<p>In the case of the variant aph’ hēmeōn at line 171 of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo in a version that survives in the medieval manuscript tradition, as we read it in Extract 4-I, my translation ‘about me’ is a cover for the deeper meaning of this expression, which is ‘by me’. As I will argue, the Maidens of Delos are being prompted ‘by me’ to respond dialogically to a question ‘about me’.<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a> And the reference to ‘me’ here, as we will see, is a riddling way of referring to Homer himself. The wording of Homer is coming ‘from me’ and is thus worded ‘by me’ to become the wording ‘about me’.</p>
<p>Similarly in the case of the variant aphēmōs in the version of line 171 quoted by Thucydides, as we read in in Extract 4-G, the meaning ‘without naming names’ signals the fact that the Maidens are being prompted to identify Homer in a riddling way, without naming him directly.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a></p>
<p>And who are these Maidens of Delos, so prominently featured here in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo? As I argue in the book Homer the Classic, the Hymn pictures the Maidens as the local Muses of Delos who sing-and-dance as a prototypical chorus, which is parallel to the picturing of Homer as a prototypical lead singer.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a></p>
<p>In this context of choral performance, I highlight the fact that the Delian Maidens in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo are described as masters of mimesis or ‘re-enactment’ (verb mīmeîsthai at verse 163).<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a> This reference is saying something that is fundamentally true about choral performance in general, which as we know from the surviving textual evidence is highly mimetic. A shining example is the extant body of choral “lyric” songs composed by Pindar in the fifth century BCE.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></p>
<p>At a later point in my argumentation, I will elaborate on the mimetic power of Pindar’s songs. For now, however, I extend the analysis from the medium of choral performance to another medium. What I just said about choral performance applies to the medium of rhapsodic performance as well: this medium too is highly mimetic. A most striking example is the interaction of Homer with the Delian Maidens in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. In this hymn, as we will now see, the rhapsodic medium is making a mimesis of the choral medium.</p>
<p>When I say rhapsodic here, I am referring to a non-choral medium of performance, which is a medium that is not sung-and-danced and not even sung - but recited. As I already noted in Part One, this medium of recitative performance was practiced by professional performers known as rhapsōidoi ‘rhapsodes’, who both competed and collaborated with each other in the performance of epic at Panhellenic festivals like the Panathenaia in Athens. I have studied this rhapsodic medium extensively in other projects, especially in the book Plato’s Rhapsody and Homer’s Music, and I present here only a brief summary of what is relevant to my ongoing argument.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a></p>
<p>Presiding over the rhapsodic competitions at the festival of the Panathenaia, as we know from a fleeting reference in Plato’s Ion (Ion 530d), were the Homēridai, who were a corporation of epic performers stemming from the island of Chios and claiming to be descended from Homer himself.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> These Homēridai, masters of rhapsodic performance, also performed hymns. Unlike other hymns, which were conventionally performed in a choral mode, the hymns of the Homēridai were composed as well as performed only in a rhapsodic mode, as characterized by a single meter known as the dactylic hexameter. And it is these hymns that have survived down to our time in a collection of hexametric hymns that we now call the Homeric Hymns. As for the choral mode of composing and performing hymns, it too has survived - in the form of choral “lyric” singing, characterized by a vast multiplicity of meters. I have already highlighted the example of choral “lyric” songs composed by Pindar in the fifth century BCE. As we will now see, the Homer of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo performs a mimesis of such a non-rhapsodic choral mode of singing when he interacts with the chorus of the Delian Maidens - though this interaction is composed in the rhapsodic medium of the dactylic hexameter.</p>
<p>In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, Homer re-enacts the Maidens by quoting what they say, which is said not in their own choral medium but in the rhapsodic medium of the Hymn.<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a> So the medium of rhapsodic performance shows that it can make a mimesis of the medium of choral performance as exemplified by the Delian Maidens, who are described as the absolute masters of choral mimesis. This way, Homer demonstrates that he is the absolute master of rhapsodic mimesis.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a></p>
<p>The argument can be taken further: the figure of Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is acting as a lead singer when he prompts the Delian Maidens to perform a response, in choral song-and-dance, to a question. As we will see, the question will be a perennial one, just as the response of the Maidens will be perennial.</p>
<p>To understand this question that is addressed to the Delian Maidens, we need to consider the entire context of the dialogue that takes place between them and Homer. The complete wording of this dialogue is not quoted by Thucydides, and we find it attested only in the medieval manuscript tradition of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. I now quote here the complete wording as preserved in that textual tradition:</p>
<p>4-J (including lines 165-172 as quoted already in 4-I)</p>
<p>|<sub>165</sub> But come now, may Apollo be gracious, along with Artemis; |<sub>166</sub> and you all also, hail [khairete] and take pleasure, all of you [Maidens of Delos]. Keep me, even in the future, |<sub>167</sub> in your mind, whenever someone, out of the whole mass of earthbound humanity, |<sub>168</sub> arrives here [to Delos], after arduous wandering, as a guest entitled to the rules of hosting, and asks this question: |<sub>169</sub> “O Maidens, who is for you the most pleasurable of singers |<sub>170</sub> that wanders here? In whom do you take the most delight [terpesthai]?” |<sub>171</sub> Then you, all of you [Maidens of Delos], must very properly respond [hupokrinasthai] about me [aph’ hēmeōn]: |<sub>172</sub> “It is a blind man, and he dwells in Chios, a rugged land. |<sub>173</sub> and all his songs will in the future prevail as the very best.” |<sub>174</sub> And I<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a> in turn will carry your fame [kleos] as far over the earth |<sub>175</sub> as I wander, throughout the cities of men, with their fair populations. |<sub>176</sub> And they will all believe - I now see -<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a> since it is genuine [etētumon]. |<sub>177</sub> As for me, I will not leave off [lēgein] making far-shooting Apollo |<sub>178</sub> [the subject of] my hymn [humnos] - the one with the silver quiver, who was borne by Leto of the fair tresses.</p>
<p>Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo 165-178<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence of Extracts 4-A through 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ at line 170.</p>
<p>Our first impression is that the question addressed here to the Delian Maidens, as quoted directly at lines 169-170, is simple and straightforward: ‘“|<sub>169</sub> O Maidens, who is for you the most pleasurable of singers |<sub>170</sub> that wanders here? In whom do you take the most delight [terpesthai]?”’.<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a> And the response of the Maidens at line 172, as also quoted directly, seems likewise simple and straightforward: ‘“|<sub>172</sub> It is a blind man, and he dwells in Chios, a rugged land”’.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64">[64]</a></p>
<p>What complicates both the question and the answer, however, is that the person who originally asks the question seems at first to be distinct from Homer. Homer seems at first to be simply quoting the question. The original questioner is described at line 168 as some nameless wanderer who will come to visit Delos in the future. Let us consider again lines 167-168 in the medieval manuscript tradition, where the nameless wanderer who addresses the question to the Delian Maidens is described in this way: ‘“|<sub>167</sub> … whenever someone, out of the whole mass of earthbound humanity, |<sub>168</sub> arrives here [to Delos], after arduous wandering, as a guest entitled to the rules of hosting, and asks this question …”’.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65">[65]</a> So, it is as if someone other than Homer were asking the question quoted by Homer.</p>
<p>This complication is what turns both the question and the answer into a riddle, since the nameless questioner is kept distinct here from Homer, even though the description of this nameless person as a wanderer who claims the right to be treated as a guest makes him look as if he were Homer himself. After all, Homer too is a wanderer, just as the nameless questioner is a wanderer. And Homer is a wandering singer who claims the right to be treated as a guest at whatever place he visits, as we see later on at lines 174-175, where he describes in his own words the fame that he will create for the Delian Maidens: ‘|<sub>174</sub> And I in turn will carry your fame [kleos] as far over the earth |<sub>175</sub> as I wander, throughout the cities of men, with their fair populations’.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66">[66]</a></p>
<p>Homer will create fame for the Delian Maidens as an act of reciprocation for the fame that the Maidens will create for Homer when they respond to the question in the words quoted by Homer himself. The difference is, the Maidens create fame for Homer in their role as singers-dancers who are stationary, while Homer creates fame for the Maidens in his role as a lead singer who is mobile, a wanderer. And Homer is the best of all wandering singers, as predicted by the wording of the question directly quoted at lines 169-170, where we read: ‘“|<sub>169</sub> O Maidens, who is for you the most pleasurable of singers |<sub>170</sub> that wanders here?…”’.<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67">[67]</a> This question already presupposes that Homer is that wandering singer. So, now the meaning loops back again to lines 167-168, where the person who addresses the question to the Delian Maidens is described in this way: ‘“|<sub>167</sub> … whenever someone, out of the whole mass of earthbound humanity, |<sub>168</sub> arrives here [to Delos], after arduous wandering, as a guest entitled to the rules of hosting, and asks this question …”’.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68">[68]</a> By now we see that this nameless wanderer, even though he seemed at first to be distinct from Homer, must be identical with Homer. And he is pictured as returning to Delos year after year to ask a question that requires the same answer year after year, and that answer is ‘Homer’.</p>
<p>Similarly, as I have argued in the book Homer the Classic, even the alternative wording of line 168 of the Hymn as quoted by Thucydides about the ‘other someone’ who comes to Delos leaves open the option of imagining that the ‘other someone’ who asks the riddling question could still be the same singer returning again and again to Delos, and this singer could still be Homer, not a substitute for Homer.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69">[69]</a> The ‘other someone’ is an ‘other’ only so long as the identification is not yet made, since this ‘other’ is nameless. But Homer does have a name, which is ostentatiously not spoken. If that name were in fact spoken, however, then the identification of the ‘other’ as Homer himself could become clear. But Homer is here being identified without being named. That, I argue, is the force of the riddling expression aphēmōs at verse 171 of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo as quoted by Thucydides: as I already noted, this expression means ‘without naming names’. So, the Maidens are being prompted by Homer to identify Homer in a riddling way, without naming him directly.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70">[70]</a></p>
<p>What makes the riddle work is that Homer remains unnamed, just as the wanderer who is quoted as asking the question is not named. But the response of the Maidens, about that blind singer who dwells in Chios, gives away the answer: this wandering singer must be Homer, who is known to be blind and who claims Chios as his residence. As we know from the Life of Homer traditions, which preserve evidence that is independent of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the blind singer who once resided in Chios can in fact be identified as Homer. I refer here to a detailed study of this evidence in the book Homer the Preclassic, where I focus on the evidence we can find in the Herodotean Life of Homer.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71">[71]</a></p>
<p>So, the response of the Maidens as quoted at lines 172-173 of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo can be seen as a mimesis of Homer by Homer about Homer; and, to complicate matters further, this mimesis is performed for Homer by the Maidens of Delos, whose existence in the song is a mimesis by Homer because it is Homer who quotes what they say.<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72">[72]</a> In a sense, then, the whole performance originates from this lead singer. And that, I argue, is the force of the complex expression aph’ hēmeōn at verse 171 of the Hymn: the Maidens are prompted ‘by me’ to respond dialogically to a question ‘about me’, and the prompt originates ‘from me’.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73">[73]</a></p>
<p>♢Homer’s eternal return to Delos in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo</p>
<p>The riddling dialogic response of the Delian Maidens to Homer is made perennial by their recurrent choral performance in response to the recurrent visit of Homer to Delos in his role as their lead singer. According to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, the performance of Homer in choral interaction with the Maidens of Delos will become a perennial event. In terms of the myth that we see encapsulated in the Hymn, there will be an eternal return of Homer to Delos.</p>
<p>To back up this formulation, I will show that the Homeric Hymn to Apollo foretells in a riddling way a seasonally recurring re-enactment of the prototypical visit of Homer to Delos. The visit will be re-enacted year after year, in a loop that loops back eternally, so that Homer may forever interact with succeeding generations of young women who will re-enact in song-and-dance the prototypical Maidens of Delos in the act of chorally responding to Homer about Homer for Homer.</p>
<p>As we will now see, the occasion for Homer’s eternal return to Delos was the annual festival of the Delia, and the word that signals this festival in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is agōn, which as I already noted means ‘competition’.</p>
<p>♢Homer as the lead singer at an agonistic choral event</p>
<p>In Odyssey viii 250-269, quoted in Extract 4-E, we have seen the figure of Demodokos performing as a lead singer who interacts with a chorus that is singing-and-dancing at a competitive choral event, and the word for this event at lines 259 and 260 is agōn, meaning ‘competition’. Here again is the wording: ‘|<sub>259</sub> … they started arranging everything according to the rules of the competition [agōn]: |<sub>260</sub> they made smooth the place of the singing-and-dancing [khoros], and they made a wide space of competition [agōn]’.<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74">[74]</a> So too in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo we see the figure of Homer himelf performing as a lead singer in his own right, and he too is interacting with a chorus that is singing-and-dancing at a competitive choral event called an agōn. That is what I will show here, arguing that the figure of Homer qualifies as a lead singer in the context of such an agōn. Or, to put it in terms of a modern word derived from agōn, Homer is a lead singer at the agonistic choral event of the Delia.</p>
<p>If we look back at the lengthy passage I quoted from Thucydides (3.104.3-6) in Extract 4-G, we can see that the historian uses this word agōn with reference to both choral and athletic competitions at the festival of the Delia (3.104.3 [choral], 3.104.5 [choral and athletic], 3.104.6 [choral and athletic]). As we can see further in Extract 4-G, Thucydides also quotes from the Homeric Hymn to Apollo a passage that features the same word agōn with reference to both choral and athletic competitions at the festival of the Delia: in one of the lines (149) quoted from the Hymn, the words orkhēstus ‘dancing’ and aoidē ‘singing’ indicate the choral competition, while the word pugmakhiē ‘boxing’ indicates one example of the various athletic competitions. The same three words, with one slight formal variation (orkhēthmos instead of orkhēstus for ‘dancing’), are also attested in the corresponding line (149) of the version found in the medieval manuscripts of the Hymn to Apollo and quoted in Extract Q. From here on, whenever I refer to competitive choral events, I will substitute the term agonistic for competitive in order to evoke the meaning of agōn as this word is used in the contexts we have just considered.</p>
<p>In the case of Odyssey viii, the agonistic choral event is ostentatiously festive, as we have already seen from my overall paraphrase of the relevant narrative, but it cannot be tied to any specific festival. In the case of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, by contrast, the corresponding agonistic choral event is pictured as taking place on a very specific occasion, at the festival of the Delia in Delos. And the choral aspect of this agonistic event that took place at the seasonally recurrent festival of the Delia is highlighted by Thucydides: he uses the word khoros ‘chorus’ in referring to female singers-and-dancers who performed at this festival (3.104.3, 3.104.5, 3.104.6). It is clear that Thucydides, in analyzing the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, imagined that Homer himself had once interacted with a prototypical khoros of these female singers-and-dancers (3.104.5), and it is also clear that he connected this prototypical khoros with the historical attestations of agonistic choral events that were taking place at the annual festival of the Delia (3.104.3, 3.104.6). This connection made by Thucydides is justified, since the Homeric Hymn in its own wording connects the Maidens of Delos with an agonistic choral event that is celebrated at the festival of the Delia in Delos. Highlighted in the Hymn, as I already noted, are the words orkhēstus / orkhēthmos ‘dancing’ and aoidē ‘singing’ (line 149). And here I return to a comparable highlighting in Odyssey viii, with reference to the skills of the Phaeacian youths in choral as well as athletic competitions (248-253): among the words that we see in this context are khoroi ‘choruses’ (248), orkhēstus ‘dancing’ (253), and aoidē ‘singing’ (253). And we have also seen the word khoros in the specific context of referring to the place of the singing-and-dancing (260).</p>
<p>In Odyssey viii, the reaction of all those who attend such an agonistic choral event is delight, as expressed by the verb terpesthai, meaning ‘feeling delight’, and such a reaction is best exemplified by the disguised Odysseus as the primary character attending the performance of Demodokos in concert with the choral singers-dancers: it is said that Odysseus, in reacting to this performance, terpeto ‘felt delight’ (368), and the same delighted reaction was experienced, it is also said, by everyone else attending the performance (368-369). Again in Odyssey xiii, where Demodokos is performing as a lead singer for the last time, the entire community is described as terpomenoi ‘feeling delight’ (27), as we saw in the passage I quoted in Extract 4-F.</p>
<p>And there is a comparable reaction in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo: at lines 146-150, which I have already quoted in Extract 4-G, the Ionian Greeks who celebrate the festival of the Delia, which is called an agōn here (150), are delighting Apollo himself: as Homer says to the god, these celebrants ‘give you delight’, terpousin (again, 150), precisely because they are celebrating the festival by way of both choral and athletic competitions (149). As the principal god who presides over the festival of the Delia, Apollo is told by Homer that ‘you feel delight’, epi-terpeo, at each recurring occasion when the festival is celebrated. Here again is the wording of the relevant lines 146-150 in the Hymn, which I quoted already in Extract 4-G: ‘|<sub>146</sub> But when, O Phoebus [Apollo], in Delos more than anywhere else you feel delight [terpesthai] in your heart [thūmos], |<sub>147</sub> there the Ionians, with tunics [khitōn plural] trailing, gather |<sub>148</sub> with their children and their wives, along the causeway [aguia], |<sub>149</sub> and there with boxing [pugmakhiē] and dancing [orkhēstus] and song [aoidē] |<sub>150</sub> they have you in mind and make you feel delight [terpein], whenever they set up a competition [agōn]’.<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75">[75]</a> The same wording, with minor variations, is attested in the corresponding text of the medieval manuscripts, and I have already quoted that text in Extract 4-H.</p>
<p>So the god Apollo, as a god, is the perfect model for everyone who attends the festival of the Delia: he reacts to the beauty and the pleasure of the Hymn to Apollo by feeling utter delight. We can see in this reaction another example of the theological principle of do as I do.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76">[76]</a> And the god’s reaction is re-enacted by the Delian Maidens when they identify Homer, without naming him, as the one who surpasses all other singers in making them too feel delight, just as Homer makes everyone feel delight. Already the question asked by the nameless singer makes it clear that the ultimate purpose of Homer is to give that feeling of delight to all: ‘“|<sub>169</sub> O Maidens, who is for you the most pleasurable of singers |<sub>170</sub> that wanders here? In whom do you take the most delight [terpesthai]?”’.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77">[77]</a> That singer, as the response of the Delian Maidens indicates in its own riddling way, must be identified as Homer.</p>
<p>♢Homer and Demodokos as masters of hymnic singing</p>
<p>We have just seen, then, how the Homeric Hymn to Apollo idealizes the sheer delight that must surely be felt by all when they hear Homer himself singing at the agonistic choral event of Apollo’s festival, the Delia. In the Hymn, a clear signal of this idealization is the programmatic use of the word terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ (146, 150, 170) in describing the reaction to Homer’s song. Also in Odyssey viii, we have seen the same programmatic use of this word terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ in describing the reaction of all those who hear the song of Demodokos about Ares and Aphrodite (368-369). And the key word for referring to the form of singing that we see being performed in both these cases is humnos, which I have translated so far simply as ‘hymn’. As the argumentation advances, we will see that both Homer and Demodokos are masters of such hymnic singing.</p>
<p>Essential for my argument is an extraordinary single line, Odyssey viii 429, referring to the singing of a humnos by Demodokos. Nowhere else in the Odyssey - or in the Iliad, for that matter - is this word humnos attested. For the moment, I translate the line without translating the word humnos itself:</p>
<p>4-K</p>
<p>… so that he [= Odysseus] may feel delight [terpesthai] at the feast [dais] and in listening to the humnos of the song.</p>
<p>Odyssey viii 429<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78">[78]</a></p>
<p>Special note: as in the other ten passages in the sequence that comes to an end with this passage, Extract 4-K, I highlight here the context of terpesthai ‘feeling delight’.</p>
<p>♢An idealization of the delight experienced at a festival</p>
<p>The context of line 429 in Odyssey viii is this: at lines 424-428, Alkinoos is speaking of his plans for the further hosting of his guest Odysseus, who has not yet identified himself. As a gracious host, Alkinoos says that he wants to arrange for his guest to be bathed in a lustral basin and then to be clothed in luxurious new garments before they all sit down to dine together, at which occasion Odysseus will receive going-away presents. The syntax of the expression ‘so that he may feel delight [terpesthai] ’ at line 429 carries two levels of meaning here, since the host’s wish is both general and specific. Generally, the guest should be gratified by the good hosting. But there is also the specific gratification of dining well while hearing the performance of song. The idea of dining at line 429, as expressed by the word dais, meaning ‘feast’, is closely combined here with the idea of hearing the performance of ‘song’, as expressed by the word aoidē together with humnos, and this combination is viewed as the best of all gratifications. In this same line 429, such sheer gratification is signaled by the programmatic word terpesthai, ‘feeling delight’. As I will now argue, what we see here is an idealization of the experience of ‘feeling delight’ in the context of a dais ‘feast’, which in turn is an idealization of a festival.</p>
<p>As Odysseus himself says later on in Odyssey ix, when he finally identifies himself, there is in fact no greater gratification in the whole world that the combination of good feasting and good singing, and the model for the general reference to singing here is the singer Demodokos:</p>
<p>4-L</p>
<p>|<sub>3</sub> This is indeed a beautiful thing, to listen to a singer [aoidos] |<sub>4</sub> such as this one [= Demodokos], the kind of singer that he is, comparable to the gods with the sound of his voice [audē], |<sub>5</sub> for I declare, there is no outcome [telos] that has more pleasurable beauty [kharis] |<sub>6</sub> than the moment when the spirit of festivity [euphrosunē]<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79">[79]</a> prevails throughout the whole community [dēmos] |<sub>7</sub> and the people at the feast [daitumones], throughout the halls, are listening to the singer [aoidos] |<sub>8</sub> as they sit there - you can see one after the other - and they are seated at tables that are filled |<sub>9</sub> with grain and meat, while wine from the mixing bowl is drawn |<sub>10</sub> by the one who pours the wine and takes it around, pouring it into their cups. |<sub>11</sub> This kind of thing, as I see it in my way of thinking, is the most beautiful thing in the whole world.</p>
<p>Odyssey ix 3-12<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80">[80]</a></p>
<p>The feast that is going on here is a continuation of the feast that is already signaled by the word dais at line 429 of Odyssey viii, quoted in Extract 4-K, which basically means ‘feast’. In that context, dais refers short-range to an occasion of communal dining (dorpon ‘dinner’: 395), which will take place after sunset (417). The intended guest of honor at this feast will be Odysseus. This occasion of communal dining leads into the third song of Demodokos (484-485). But this same word dais at line 429 of Odyssey viii is also making a long-range reference: it refers metonymically to a stylized festival that has been ongoing ever since an earlier occasion of communal dining (71-72), which actually led into the first song of Demodokos (73-83). And let me go even further back in time. Leading up to the communal dining, there had been an animal sacrifice (as expressed by the word hiereuein ‘sacrificially slaughter’: 59). Then, the meat of the sacrificed animals (twelve sheep, eight pigs, and two oxen: 59-60) had been prepared to be cooked at the feast (61). And I stress that the word at line 61 for ‘feast’ is once again dais.</p>
<p>Etymologically, this word dais refers to the ‘distribution’ of cooked meat in various hierarchical ways among the people of the community. Then, by way of synecdoche, the specific idea of distribution extends metonymically to the general idea of feasting and further to the even more general idea of a festival.</p>
<p>Following the logic of this sequence of meanings, we see that the animal sacrifice in Odyssey viii (59) had led to the cooking and the distribution of the meat (61), which had led to the communal dining (71-72), which had led to the first song of Demodokos (73-83), and so on. In terms of this logic, the metonymic use of the word dais ‘feast’ marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals: animal sacrifice, communal feasting, singing at the feast.<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81">[81]</a></p>
<p>Besides these events in Odyssey viii, we find another set of events that are likewise typical of festivals. Right after the first song of Demodokos has come to an end (83), the king of the Phaeacians announces that there will now be a pause in the eating and the drinking, to which he refers generally as a dais ‘feast’ (98 and 99), and the pause extends to the singing that accompanies the dais (99), since the time has come for athletic contests, that is, aethloi / aethla (100), to be held outside the palace, in the public gathering space of the Phaeacians (100-101, 109). The king refers to boxing, wrestling, jumping, and footracing (103). The first athletic event turns out to be the footrace (120-125), followed by wrestling (126-127), jumping (128), discus throwing (129), and boxing (130). The general term that refers to the occasion of all these events is agōn, meaning ‘competition’ or ‘place of competition’ (200, 238).</p>
<p>There is a striking parallel to be found in a passage we have already examined in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (146-155), describing a festival of all Ionians gathered on the island of Delos. In this case as well, the occasion of that Delian festival is described as an agōn ‘competition’ (149). The competitive events at that festival include athletics - boxing is the example that is highlighted – as well as dancing and singing (149). Similarly in Odyssey viii, the competition includes singing as well as athletics, as we see from the fact that the three songs performed by Demodokos become a foil for the later performance of Odysseus starting in Odyssey ix. And the occasion for the singing of Demodokos in Odyssey viii, as we have already seen, is the ongoing dais ‘feast’ (429), which is a stylized festival - and which continues to be the occasion for the competing performance of Odysseus in Odyssey ix.<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82">[82]</a></p>
<p>For the moment I concentrate not on the singing but on the athletics. As in the case of singing, athletics too can be seen as a source of ‘feeling delight’, terpesthai, to be experienced at a festival. I cite yet again the relevant lines 146-150 in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, as quoted in Extract 4-G, concerning the festival of the Delia: ‘|<sub>146</sub> But when, O Phoebus [Apollo], in Delos more than anywhere else you feel delight [terpesthai] in your heart [thūmos], |<sub>147</sub> there the Ionians, with tunics [khitōn plural] trailing, gather |<sub>148</sub> with their children and their wives, along the causeway [aguia], |<sub>149</sub> and there with boxing [pugmakhiē] and dancing [orkhēstus] and song [aoidē] |<sub>150</sub> they have you in mind and make you feel delight [terpein], whenever they set up a competition [agōn]’.<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83">[83]</a></p>
<p>♢The relevant etymology of a Hittite word</p>
<p>The idea of ‘feeling delight’ at a festive event, as expressed by the Greek verb terpesthai, is built into a related form that we find attested in the Hittite language. It is the noun tarpa-, attested in a Hittite text dating from the second millennium BCE. In this particular text (Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazköi XXIII 55 I, 2-27), analyzed by Jaan Puhvel, an athletic event is described. There is to be an animal sacrifice (four rams and an unspecified number of bulls), and a wrestling match takes place. As Puhvel notes, “a miltary gathering in the iconic presence of the solar deity seems to be the occasion.”<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84">[84]</a> And the word that refers to this event is tarpa-. This word, Puhvel suggests, “would then be the ‘pleasure part’ of the event, the distribution, celebration, and enjoyment of winnings, perhaps even etymologically cognate with the Greek terp[esthai], ‘to delight’, which crops up so often in the Homeric vocabulary of sports.”<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85">[85]</a></p>
<p>In making this argument, Puhvel cites a number of Homeric lines that feature this word terpesthai, and among them is line 131 of Odyssey viii, where the Phaeacians are said to be ‘feeling delight’ in response to the spectacular aethloi / aethla or ‘contests’ that are then taking place. These contests are athletic competitions, which as we have just seen are imagined as part of the ongoing festivities that are narrated in Odyssey viii. At line 131, the word terpesthai ‘feeling delight’ focuses on athletics as a particular aspect of the festivities, whereas later on at line 429, as quoted in Extract 4-K, the same word focuses on the singing of Demodokos. In both lines, the overall context is a stylized festival.</p>
<p>♢The festive context of hymnic singing</p>
<p>I now turn to the humnos that Demodokos is singing at line 429 of Odyssey viii. As we have just seen in the same line, the overall context for this singing is a stylized festival, signaled by the word dais ‘feast’. This festive context, as we will now see, is the key to understanding what the word humnos means here.</p>
<p>As I showed in the book Homer the Classic, this word humnos fits all the forms of singing performed by Demodokos at the ongoing festival narrated in Odyssey viii, including the song that he finishes performing at line 367, which is a story about Ares and Aphrodite.<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86">[86]</a> As I also showed in that book, the morphology of this particular song is cognate with the morphology of the so-called Homeric Hymns, including the Homeric Hymn to Apollo.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87">[87]</a> And, as we will see, many of the Homeric Hymns actually refer to themselves in terms of humnos. This is not to say, however, that the translation of humnos as ‘hymn’ is sufficient for helping us understand the combination of this noun with the genitive of the noun aoidē at line 429 of Odyssey viii, where Alkinoos expresses the wish that Odysseus ‘may feel delight [terpesthai] at the feast [dais] and in listening to the humnos of the song [aoidē]’. We are still left with the problem of translating humnos in the actual context of a ‘humnos of the song [aoidē]’. Here is where I shift from the figure of Demodokos as a master of hymnic singing to the figure of Homer as represented in the Homeric Hymns, especially in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. Homer too, as we will now see, is a master of hymnic singing.</p>
<p>♢A metonymy of hymning</p>
<p>The English words hymn / hymnic / hymning derive from the programmatic use of the Greek word humnos in poetry as exemplified by the Homeric Hymns. Each one of these Hymns is addressed to a god or goddess who notionally presides over the performance of the hymn, and this link to divinity is in fact the key to the meaning of humnos. As we will see from attestations of this word in the Hymns, a humnos is seen as a perfect beginning of a perfect song. And the beginning is perfect if the divinity to whom the song is addressed favors the performance of the beginning. But the humnos is not just a perfect beginning. It is also the signal of a perfect transition to the rest of the performance. By metonymy, the humnos includes the rest of the performance, proceeding sequentially all the way to the conclusion of the whole performance. If the performance is sequential, consequential, you know it was started by a humnos and you know it is really a humnos.<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88">[88]</a></p>
<p>♢The hymnic subject</p>
<p>To analyze further the programmatic use of the word humnos in the Homeric Hymns, I find it useful to introduce a relevant term, the hymnic subject. In the Homeric Hymns, the invoked divinity who presides over a given festival is the hymnic subject of the hymn. In the language of the Hymns, however, the divinity who figures as the subject of any hymn is normally the grammatical object of the verb of singing the hymn (as at the beginnings of Homeric Hymns 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23. 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32). In the logic of the Hymns, the hymnic subject is the divinity that presides over the occasion of performance and becomes continuous with the occasion and thus becomes the occasion.<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89">[89]</a></p>
<p>♢A theology of perfection in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo</p>
<p>The occasion of a humnos is notionally perfect because the divinity who is the occasion is perfect. The theological notion of such perfection is expressed by way of the word eu-humnos (εὔυμνος) ‘good for hymning’, as in the sublime aporetic question that is asked twice in the Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo (verses 19 and 207):<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90">[90]</a></p>
<p>4-M</p>
<p>For how shall I hymn you, you who are so absolutely [pantōs] good for hymning [eu-humnos]?</p>
<p>Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo 19 and 207<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91">[91]</a></p>
<p>The theological rationale of this aporetic question can be formulated this way:</p>
<p>Faced with the absoluteness of the god, the performer experiences a rhetorical hesitation: how can I make the subject of my humnos something that is perfect, absolute? The absoluteness of this hymnic subject is signaled by the programmatic adverb pantōs ‘absolutely’, which modifies not only the adjective eu-humnos ‘good for hymning’ but also the entire phrasing about the absoluteness of the subject. The absoluteness of the god Apollo is continuous with the absoluteness of the humnos that makes Apollo its subject. This Homeric Hymn is saying about itself that it is the perfect and absolute humnos. As such, it is not only the beginning of a composition but also the totality of the composition, authorizing everything that follows it, because it was begun so perfectly. And the source of the perfection is the god as the subject of the humnos.<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92">[92]</a></p>
<p>The naming of the divinity as the subject of the humnos, together with the initial describing of the divinity, is the notionally perfect beginning of the humnos, and this beginning is the prooimion. We have already seen in Extract 4-G that Thucydides refers to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo explicitly as a prooimion (3.104.4, 5).</p>
<p>Whereas the word prooimion is a term referring only to the start of the continuum that is activated by a hymn, the word humnos retains the full extent of the poetic agenda, referring both to the start of the continuum and to the continuum itself. This connecting of the start to the continuity, as expressed by the word humnos, is a sublime act of metonymy. And the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is a perfect example: it refers to itself in terms of a humnos (verses 158, 161, 178), while Thucydides, as I just noted again, refers to it in a more restrictive way as a prooimion (3.104.4, 5).<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93">[93]</a></p>
<p>♢The etymologies of prooimion and humnos</p>
<p>This parallelism of the words prooimion and humnos in referring to the start of a continuum, which I have just described as a sublime act of metonymy, can be explained in terms of a parallelism that we find in their etymologies.</p>
<p>I will start with prooimion. The conventional meaning of this Greek word is conveyed by the Latin borrowing prooemium, which refers to the beginning of any work of verbal art. The original Greek form pro-oimion is a compound noun, and its etymology derives from a metaphorical reference to pattern-weaving: the word means literally the ‘initial threading’ of a song, parallel to the etymology of Latin ex-ordium, which is a synonym of pro-oemium in poetic and rhetorical contexts and which can likewise be traced back to the basic idea of an ‘initial threading’. To say it more technically in Greek, using the terminology of fabric work, the ‘initial threading’ is the exastis or ‘selvedge’.<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94">[94]</a></p>
<p>As for the etymology of the simplex noun humnos, I argue that it too derives from a metaphorical reference to pattern-weaving. If I am right in explaining humnos morphologically as a noun derived from the root huph- of the verb huphainein ‘weave’, the basic idea conveyed by this noun is ‘web’. In terms of my argument, the humnos is metaphorically the product of weaving in general and of pattern-weaving in particular.<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95">[95]</a></p>
<p>♢Starting again with Homer and Demodokos as masters of hymnic singing</p>
<p>These parallel etymologies of words referring to the hymning of Apollo are relevant to the figuring of both Homer and Demodokos as masters of hymnic singing. If in fact such hymnic singing is to be understood in terms of a metaphor for pattern-weaving, then what we see at work here once again is the metaphorization of Homeric poetry as a masterpiece of such pattern-weaving. We have already seen such a metaphorization when we considered the passages in the Iliad describing the web pattern-woven by Andromache, as quoted in Extract 2-O, and the web pattern-woven by Helen, as quoted in Extract 2-P. In those cases, we also saw that such masterpieces of pattern-weaving are likewise masterpieces of metonymy. And now I will develop a parallel argument about the humnos that refers to the ongoing performance of Demodokos in Odyssey viii 429 and about the humnos that refers to the ongoing performance of Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo 178.</p>
<p>♢The hymnic metabasis and the hymnic consequent</p>
<p>Here I introduce two relevant terms, the hymnic consequent and the hymnic metabasis. The first, hymnic consequent, refers to a performance that follows the performance of a humnos. The second term, hymnic metabasis, refers to the transition that actually makes it possible for the hymnic consequent to follow the humnos.<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96">[96]</a></p>
<p>Here are three most telling examples of hymnic metabasis in the Homeric Hymns:</p>
<p>4-Na</p>
<p>|<sub>292</sub> Hail and take pleasure [khaire], goddess, queen of well-founded Cyprus. |<sub>293</sub> But, having started off from you, I will move ahead and shift forward [metabainein] to the rest of the humnos.</p>
<p>Homeric Hymn (5) to Aphrodite 292-293<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97">[97]</a></p>
<p>4-Nb</p>
<p>|<sub>7</sub> So, with all this said, I say to you [= Artemis] now: hail and take pleasure [khaire], and along with you may all the other goddesses [take pleasure] from my song. |<sub>8</sub> As for me, I sing you first of all and from you do I start off [arkhesthai] to sing. |<sub>9</sub> And, having started off from you, I will move ahead and shift forward [metabainein] to the rest of the humnos.<a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98">[98]</a></p>
<p>Homeric Hymn (9) to Artemis 7-9<a href="#_ftn99" name="_ftnref99">[99]</a></p>
<p>4-Nc</p>
<p>|<sub>10</sub> So, with all this said, I say to you [= Hermes] now: hail and take pleasure, son of Zeus and Maia. |<sub>11</sub> And, having started off from you, I will move ahead and shift forward [metabainein] to the rest of the humnos. |<sub>12</sub> Hail and take pleasure [khaire], Hermes, giver of pleasurable beauty [kharis], you who are conductor [of psukhai] and giver of good things.</p>
<p>Homeric Hymn (18) to Hermes 10-12<a href="#_ftn100" name="_ftnref100">[100]</a></p>
<p>The transition in each one of these passages, as marked by metabainein ‘move ahead and shift forward’, is predicated on the idea of a perfect beginning. The idea is, ‘I begin, starting from the god’. This process of transition, to which I refer by way of the prosaic noun metabasis, which is derived from the poetic verb metabainein as we see it used in these three passages, is activated by the hymnic salutation khaire / khairete, which I interpret as ‘hail and take pleasure’. Implicit in these imperative forms of the verb khairein is the meaning of the related noun kharis, which conveys the idea of a ‘favor’ achieved by reciprocating the pleasure of beauty. Making this idea explicit, I have formulated a paraphrase of khaire / khairete in the context of all its occurrences in the Homeric Hymns:</p>
<p>Now, at this precise moment, with all this said, I greet you, god (or gods) presiding over the festive occasion, calling on you to show favor [kharis] in return for the beauty and the pleasure of this, my performance.<a href="#_ftn101" name="_ftnref101">[101]</a></p>
<p>What drives the performative gesture of khaire / khairete is the fundamental idea that the reciprocal favor of kharis is the same beautiful thing as the pleasure that it gives. And to give such pleasure, I argue, is seen as an essential requirement for achieving a successful reception.<a href="#_ftn102" name="_ftnref102">[102]</a></p>
<p>After the signal khaire / khairete in the Homeric Hymns, the actual process of metabasis can be activated. This process is made explicit in the expression we have just seen in the three passages that I quoted, ‘I will move ahead and shift forward [metabainein] to the rest of the humnos’ (Homeric Hymns 5.292-293, 9.7-9, 18.10-12).<a href="#_ftn103" name="_ftnref103">[103]</a> The word humnos in the wording ἄλλον ἐς ὕμνον in the Homeric Hymns marks the whole performance, so that ἄλλον ἐς ὕμνον means not ‘extending into another performance’ but ‘extending into the rest of the performance’.<a href="#_ftn104" name="_ftnref104">[104]</a></p>
<p>Here I summarize my earlier findings about these transitions, which I continue to describe in terms of metabasis:</p>
<p>Metabasis is a device that signals a shift from the subject of the god with whom the song started – what I have been calling the hymnic subject – and then proceeds to a different subject – in what must remain notionally the same song. Ideally, the shift from subject to different subject will be smooth. Ideally, the different subject will be consequential, so that the consequent of what was started in the humnos may remain part of the humnos. This way, the transition will lead seamlessly to what is being called ‘the rest of the song’. In other words, the concept of humnos is the concept of maintaining the song as the notionally same song by way of successfully executing a metabasis from the initial subject to the next subject. The initial subject of the god and the next subject are linked as one song by the humnos in general and by the device of hymnic metabasis in particular. What comes before the metabasis is the prooimion, the beginning of the humnos. What comes after the metabasis is no longer the prooimion – but it can still be considered the humnos.<a href="#_ftn105" name="_ftnref105">[105]</a></p>
<p>In this formulation centering on the hymnic metabasis, I have already anticipated the concept of the hymnic consequent. Following up, I now propose to show examples of the kind of performance that “comes after” the hymnic metabasis. In the book Homer the Preclassic, I have worked up a set of relevant arguments that take up more than twenty-five paragraphs of space, and there is no time for me here to recapture all that argumentation. Instead, I have to content myself here with a brief summary, which I divide into five comments that all relate to the concept of a hymnic consequent.<a href="#_ftn106" name="_ftnref106">[106]</a></p>
<p>Each one of the five comments will refer to the ongoing performance of the blind singer Demodokos in Odyssey viii. The word for this performance, as we have already seen at line 429 as quoted in Extract 4-K, is humnos. And the context for this ongoing humnos, as we have also already seen, is described in the same line 429 as a dais ‘feast’, indicating a stylized festival. This ongoing humnos is envisaged as an alternative to - and a rival of - the future performance of Odysseus when he gets to tell his own story in Odyssey ix x xi xii. And what makes the performing of Demodokos so different from the future performing of Odysseus? As I show in Homer the Preclassic, Demodokos is represented as performing forms of song that resemble (a) the epic form of the so-called epic Cycle, in the case of his first and third songs, which are about the Trojan War, and (b) the hymnic form of the Homeric Hymns, in the case of his second song, which is about the love affair of Ares and Aphrodite.<a href="#_ftn107" name="_ftnref107">[107]</a> By contrast, Odysseus is represented as performing a form of song that resembles the epic form of the Homeric Odyssey itself.</p>
<p>With this background in place, I am now ready to make my five comments relating to the concept of a hymnic consequent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each one of the three songs of Demodokos in Odyssey viii starts with a new hymnic prooimion, and each one of these three new prooimia is followed by a new hymnic consequent.<a href="#_ftn108" name="_ftnref108">[108]</a></li>
<li>In the case of the first and the third songs, the hymnic consequent is epic poetry about the Trojan War (73-83 and 486-520 respectively). In the case of the second song, the hymnic consequent is a choral song and dance that narrates the love affair of Ares and Aphrodite (370-380; supplemented by 262-265); in the overall narration, the performance of choral song and dance is preceded by an embedded narration of this love affair, performed by Demodokos and quoted by the epic medium of the Homeric Odyssey (266-366).<a href="#_ftn109" name="_ftnref109">[109]</a></li>
<li>Just as the Homeric Hymns have hymnic prooimia and allow for metabasis to follow, so also the third song of Demodokos has a hymnic prooimion followed by a metabasis, which is performed by Demodokos after the disguised guest Odysseus challenges the singer to metabainein ‘move ahead and shift forward’ to the story of the Wooden Horse in the epic narration of the Trojan War (492 μετάβηθι).<a href="#_ftn110" name="_ftnref110">[110]</a></li>
<li>The god invoked in each one of the three hymnic prooimia performed by Demodokos in Odyssey viii turns out to be one and the same god, but the identity of this god is revealed only in Odyssey xiii, after both Demodokos and Odysseus have finished their rival performances. We are about to see in my next and last comment, the fifth, that this god is Zeus himself. But before we turn to the subject of Zeus, I must emphasize here in this fourth comment that the performance of Odysseus in Odyssey ix x xi xii, just like the performance of Demodokos in Odyssey viii, takes place in the context of one single ongoing festival, which as I am arguing is stylized as a dais ‘feast’ in Odyssey viii (429; also already at 61).<a href="#_ftn111" name="_ftnref111">[111]</a></li>
<li>The word agōn ‘competition’ in Odyssey viii (259, 260, 380) points to the festivities that have been ongoing at this festival ever since it started with an animal sacrifice (59-61), which inaugurates the dais ‘feast’ (61). Here I recall the Homeric Hymn (3)<em> to Apollo</em>, where we have seen this same word agōn ‘competition’ used with reference to the recurrent festival of Apollo on the island of Delos (150). The feasting and the competition that start in Odyssey viii continue all the way through the narrative performed by Odysseus in Odyssey ix x xi xii, lasting all night. Then, after dawn finally arrives in Odyssey xiii (23), there is another animal sacrifice (24), and this time the divine recipient of the sacrifice is mentioned by name: he is Zeus himself (25). This god, I argue, is the transcendent hymnic subject of the Homēridai, who as I noted already were a corporation of epic performers claiming to be descended from Homer of Chios.<a href="#_ftn112" name="_ftnref112">[112]</a> So we see here a signature, as it were, of the Homeric tradition as represented by the Homēridai of Chios. The Homeric way of narrating epic, as exemplified by the performance of Odysseus in Odyssey ix x xi xii, is recognized by way of a concluding sacrifice to Zeus, who is the primary hymnic subject of the Homēridai.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the basis of the analysis I have offered in these five comments, I can offer an overall formulation about the device of metabasis as we find it activated at line 492 of Odyssey viii (μετάβηθι): in the ongoing performance of Demodokos, viewed as a humnos at line 429 (ὕμνον ἀοιδῆς), the hymnic consequence of the hymnic metabasis is epic itself.</p>
<p>But the ongoing performance of Demodokos in Odyssey viii, as signaled by the word humnos at line 429, is more complicated. A distinctive feature of the outer narrative in Odyssey viii is that it separates the three songs of Demodokos from each other: each one of his three songs is represented as having its own separate starting point. And yet, these three separate inner narratives show signs of a narrative continuum connecting the three songs. The connectedness of this continuum will be made evident through the privileged perspective of Odysseus as he listens to the three stories of the inner narrative. The hero will make the mental connections that need to be made by the outer narrative, and his own performance of epic in Odyssey ix x xi xii shows that these connections were successfully made. That is what I argue in the book Homer the Classic.<a href="#_ftn113" name="_ftnref113">[113]</a> In terms of this argument, the process of making the humnos in Odyssey viii, as signaled at line 429, is the process of making such mental connections. By indicating connections that achieve a narrative continuum in the Homeric Odyssey, the word humnos is self-referential: in referring to the ongoing humnos, Homeric poetry is referring to itself.</p>
<p>The Homeric Hymn to Apollo, featuring the ongoing performance of the singer who is figured as Homer, is likewise quite complicated. This figure addresses the Delian Maidens with the hymnic salutation khairete ‘hail and take pleasure’ at line 166 - just as the figure of Hesiod addresses the Olympian Muses with the same hymnic salutation khairete at line 104 of the Theogony. The parallelism indicates that Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is in effect hymning not only the divine Apollo but also the Delian Maidens, who can be seen as the local Muses of Delos and who are therefore divine in their own right.<a href="#_ftn114" name="_ftnref114">[114]</a></p>
<p>In fact, the role of the Delian Maidens as divine hymnic counterparts of the god Apollo is what directly authorizes the role of Homer as master of the humnos. These Maidens are figured not only as attendants of Apollo (157) but also as the prototypical singers of a humnos or ‘hymn’ (161: ὕμνον), which is a song that makes Apollo the subject of that song (158: ὑμνήσωσιν). That song, of course, is the prototype of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo as sung by Homer himself, who declares that he in his own right is making Apollo the subject of the humnos that he himself sings (178).</p>
<p>But Homer is also making the Delian Maidens the subject of this same humnos, since he addresses them in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo as if they were a sacred chorus led by the god Apollo himself as their lead singer. The Delian Maidens must be delighted by Homer’s song just as Apollo is delighted.</p>
<p>So, what really complicates things here is the fact that the hymnic salutation khairete ‘hail and take pleasure’ that signals a hymnic metabasis at line 166 in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is addressed not to Apollo but to the Delian Maidens. The Homeric Hymn to Apollo is not yet directing its hymnic salutation at Apollo, who is still to be hymned as the god of Delphi after he is hymned as the god of Delos. And what follows the hymnic salutation to the Delian Maidens at line 166 of the Hymn is not a metabasis or transition to a new subject in the rest of the performance, as in other Homeric Hymns. Instead, the primary subject remains Apollo, and the performance itself continues in a hymnic mode, with a transition from hymning Apollo as worshipped at Delos to Apollo as worshipped at Delphi. In the meantime, however, there is another kind of transition going on. Homer himself will be transitioning out of Delos and taking his performance on the road, as it were, throughout the cities of the Greek world. He will be a wandering singer of epic while the Delian Maidens, as stationary singers-dancers of the Hymn to Apollo, will stay in Delos, awaiting the return of Homer on the ocasion of the upcoming year’s festival of the Delia.</p>
<p>Homer’s hymnic salutation of the Maidens at line 166, khairete ‘hail and take pleasure’, is a wish that is fulfilled every year, and the Maidens affirm this annual wish-fulfillment when they respond to the question ‘“|<sub>169</sub> O Maidens, who is for you the most pleasurable of singers |<sub>170</sub> that wanders here? In whom do you take the most delight [terpesthai]?”’.<a href="#_ftn115" name="_ftnref115">[115]</a> Each and every year at the Delia, the answer will be the same: this most pleasurable of all singers will be Homer himself, and Homer’s hymnic salutation to the Maidens, wishing that they take pleasure in his singing, will be his eternal wish-fulfillment.</p>
<p>Thucydides himself shows that he understands the significance of Homer’s hymnic salutation of the Delian Maidens in the context of his paraphrasing what Homer tells the Maidens at lines 165-172 of the Hymn: in the words of the historian (3.104.5), as quoted in Extract 4-G, Homer in his prooimion praises these prototypical singers of the humnos as the subject of his own humnos, just as he praises the god Apollo himself. The noun used here by Thucydides (3.104.5) with reference to the humnos performed by Homer is not humnos but prooimion, but the corresponding verb that he uses in this same context to express the idea of Homer’s performance is humneîn (ὑμνήσας). This verb here takes as its grammatical object the noun referring to the female singers-dancers who represent the Delian Maidens themselves. So, in the reading of Thucydides, Homer in his prooimion is ‘hymning’ the Delian Maidens, not only the god Apollo.</p>
<p>It is not a contradiction, however, to maintain that the Delian Maidens are simultaneously envisioned as members of a local khoros ‘chorus’ of girls or women.<a href="#_ftn116" name="_ftnref116">[116]</a> In terms of my argument, the role of divinity can be appropriated by members of a chorus during choral performance. That is to say, the Delian Maidens as a choral ensemble can re-enact the local Delian Muses.<a href="#_ftn117" name="_ftnref117">[117]</a></p>
<p>By now we have seen a wide variety of complications and subtleties involved in the making of metabasis, which I define overall as a transition from a notionally perfect beginning into a continuum that will ultimately come to a perfect close. Viewing the poetics of transition from this standpoint, I bring this section to a close by citing a relevant formulation by Elroy Bundy: “Beginnings, middles, and ends: the meaning of literature resides in its transitions.”<a href="#_ftn118" name="_ftnref118">[118]</a></p>
<p>♢The festive humnos in the Homeric Odyssey</p>
<p>Having analyzed the meaning of the word humnos as we see it at work in the Homeric Hymns, I now look back at the unique attestation of this same word at verse 429 of Odyssey viii, quoted in Extract 4-K. By now we can see that humnos here signals an ongoing performance by the singer Demodokos, and the occasion is a correspondingly ongoing festival, as signaled by the word dais ‘feast’ at the same line 429.<a href="#_ftn119" name="_ftnref119">[119]</a> Part of the ongoing humnos is the second performance of Demodokos in Odyssey viii, where he sings the story of the love affair of Ares and Aphrodite, and I already referred to the occasion of this performance as a festival. I noted, though, that this occasion cannot be tied to any specific festival as in the case of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, where that particular occasion is clearly the festival of the Delia. Still, the performance of Demodokos happens at a festival, even if that festivel is only a virtual one. And, as I say, it is an ongoing festival.</p>
<p>♢Returning to that most festive of all moments in the Iliad</p>
<p>From our reading of the narrative in Odyssey viii about the ongoing performance of Demodokos at a festival that is stylized as a correspondingly ongoing feast, we can see at least in broad outlines the figuring of an earlier kind of Homer as he existed in an earlier phase of his evolution. In this earlier phase, Homer is pictured as a master of hymnic singing, which would be an older kind of performance. In a later phase, he becomes a master of epic recitation, which would be a newer kind of performance. I have already described the occasion of hymnic singing as an agonistic choral event. As for the occasion of epic recitation, it is likewise an agonistic event, but the competition is in this case no longer choral but rhapsodic. In speaking here of an agonistic rhapsodic event, I have in mind once again the recitative and non-choral medium of performance practiced by professionals called rhapsōidoi ‘rhapsodes’.</p>
<p>This formulation, as we will now see, is relevant to what I described earlier as that most festive of all moments in the Iliad. It is the moment at lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII where we either see or do not see Homer himself performing at a festival. In the longer version of this Iliadic passage, as quoted in Extract 4-B, we do see Homer performing, but in the shorter version, as quoted in Extract 4-C, he has been removed from view.</p>
<p>This dichotomy reflects a differentiation between rhapsodic and choral performance, and I review here the relevant parts of what I said earlier about this differentiation:</p>
<p>- Rhapsodes both competed and collaborated with each other in the performance of epic at Panhellenic festivals like the Panathenaia in Athens.</p>
<p>- Presiding over the agonistic rhapsodic events at that particular festival were the Homēridai, epic performers claiming to be descended from Homer of Chios.</p>
<p>- These Homēridai, masters of epic performance, also performed hymns, but these hymns were composed as well as performed only in a rhapsodic mode, as characterized by a single meter known as the dactylic hexameter. And it is these hymns that have survived down to our time as the Homeric Hymns.</p>
<p>- As for the choral mode of composing and performing hymns, it too has survived - in the form of choral “lyric” song, characterized by a vast multiplicity of meters.<a href="#_ftn120" name="_ftnref120">[120]</a></p>
<p>That said, I confront here a simple historical fact: the rhapsodic recitation of the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey in historical times is not a choral mode for performance. Similarly, the figure of Odysseus does not engage in a choral mode of performance when he recites his own epic narrative in Odyssey ix x xi xii. By contrast, Demodokos still needs the old choral mode when he interacts with a stylized chorus of Phaeacians in performing the story of the love affair between Ares and Aphrodite. And even the Homer of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is at least performing a mimesis of the old choral mode when he interacts with the chorus of the Delian Maidens - though this interaction is performed in the rhapsodic medium of the dactylic hexameter.</p>
<p>A comparable formulation applies in the case of the variation we see between the longer version of Iliad XVIII 603-606 as quoted in Extract 4-B and the shorter version as quoted in Extract 4-C. In the longer version, we find Homer himself engaging in the earlier choral mode of performance, while the shorter version has no room for him any more, because he has already become a rhapsodic specialist. So, in the shorter version, Homer is elided from the choral scene. We can no longer see him there.</p>
<p>By contrast, it is the chorus that we can no longer see in Odyssey xiii 24-28 as quoted in Extract 4-F, where Demodokos is shown performing for the last time. Here the choral mode of his performance is shaded over while the rhapsodic mode is highlighted. There is no direct mention of a participating chorus here. Such an elision of the chorus in Odyssey xiii reflects a transition in the narrative - from the generally choral mode of performance by Demodokos in Odyssey viii to the specifically rhapsodic mode of Odysseus as a precursor of a newer non-choral Homer in Odyssey ix x xi xii. And the naming of Zeus as the recipient of the sacrifice that concludes the feast in Odyssey xiii 24-28, as quoted in Extract 4-F, can be seen here as a signature of the Homēridai as the rhapsodic heirs of Homer, since the form of their hymns - specifically, of their prooimia - allowed for Zeus to become the ultimate hymnic subject of any Homeric performance - even if that performance took place at a festival celebrating some other god. No matter which god was the immediate hymnic subject of a Homeric prooimion, the ultimate hymnic subject for the Homēridai was normally Zeus.<a href="#_ftn121" name="_ftnref121">[121]</a></p>
<p>This Homeric signature of the Homēridai in starting any Homeric prooimion with Zeus is most tellingly echoed in the words of Pindar. These words, which I now quote, start off a song that we know as Nemean 2:</p>
<p>4-O</p>
<p>[Starting] from the point where [hothen] the Homēridai, singers, most of the time [ta polla] begin [arkhesthai] their stitched-together [rhapta] words, from the prooimion of Zeus …</p>
<p>Pindar Nemean 2.1-3<a href="#_ftn122" name="_ftnref122">[122]</a></p>
<p>To say that Zeus is the song’s point of departure in Pindar’s Nemean 2 is the equivalent of saying that this point of departure is the prooimion of Zeus, in that the prooimion starts with the god and is a continuation from the god. Further, the continuity that is started by the prooimion becomes the continuum that is the humnos.<a href="#_ftn123" name="_ftnref123">[123]</a></p>
<p>With this formulation in place, I can now return to my earlier argument about a basic divergence between the meanings of prooimion and humnos: whereas the word prooimion refers only to the start of the continuum, the word humnos refers to both the start of the continuum and the continuum itself. To put it another way, the naming of the god is a metonymy – of and by itself – from the standpoint of the prooimion that starts off with the naming of the god, and the whole process of starting and then continuing is the essence of humnos. Then, in the logic of the humnos, there is even further metonymy: the god who presides over the occasion of performance becomes continuous with the occasion and thus becomes the occasion.<a href="#_ftn124" name="_ftnref124">[124]</a></p>
<p>At the very end of Pindar’s Nemean 2, the wording of the song most tellingly loops back to the very beginning:</p>
<p>4-P</p>
<p>Him [= Zeus, presiding over the festival of the Némea] you O citizens of the city must celebrate [kōmazein] for the sake of Timodemos, at the moment of his homecoming marked by genuine fame [kleos], and, in sweet-sounding song, you must lead off [ex-arkhein] with your voice.</p>
<p>Pindar Nemean 2.23-25<a href="#_ftn125" name="_ftnref125">[125]</a></p>
<p>Here at the end of the song, the chorus of performers is imagined as an assembly of the citizens of the city who are called upon to ‘begin’ or ‘lead off’, ex-arkhein, as if they had become transformed into a lead singer whose song will lead into the collective choral singing-and-dancing. So the chorus here is pictured as making a mimesis of its own lead singer - who could be imagined as Homer himself, the notional ancestor of the Homēridai.</p>
<p>In terms of my argument, we have already seen such a lead singer. He was pictured at lines 603-606 of Iliad XVIII, as quoted in Extracts 4-A and 4-B. The word ex-arkhein ‘lead off’ at line 606 there, as we saw, signals an individuated performer who interacts with the collective performance of a singing-and-dancing chorus.<a href="#_ftn126" name="_ftnref126">[126]</a> So also in the mimetic world of Pindar’s Nemean 2, the same word ex-arkhein ‘lead off’ at the last line of this song signals a new beginning for the singing-and-dancing of the chorus - a beginning that is ‘led off’ by an imagined Homer who gives ‘voice’ to the words of song.<a href="#_ftn127" name="_ftnref127">[127]</a></p>
<p>This imagined Homer matches not only the anonymous singer of Iliad XVIII 606 but also another ostentatiously anonymous singer. I have in mind here the Homer who refers to himself without naming himself in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. That other Homer seems at first to be simply a solo singer, but he is not. Rather, that Homer is a solo singer only in the making. The self-portrait of that Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo pictures a singer in the act of taking the lead in the performance of a singing-and-dancing chorus.<a href="#_ftn128" name="_ftnref128">[128]</a> That Homer in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo is making a mimesis of himself as the lead singer of a chorus, and the model for his emergence as an individual performer is the god Apollo himself.<a href="#_ftn129" name="_ftnref129">[129]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Homeric textual tradition shows a textual variation here: besides ποίκιλλε (poikillein) in the specific sense of ‘pattern-weave’ we find also the variant ποίησε (poieîn) in the general sense of ‘make’.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> As we will see, this word khoros can designate either the place where singing-and-dancing takes place or the group of singers-and-dancers who perform at that place.</p>

I also note here, in passing, the textual variation between τερπόμενοι and τερπόμενος at line 604 in the medieval manuscript tradition. We find the plural form τερπόμενοι in a majority of the manuscripts, while the singular τερπόμενος is attested in a small minority. My translation of line 604, as I indicate in my corresponding note on this line, is not affected by this textual variation. In the text of Athenaeus (5.181b and 5.181d) where he quotes this same line 604 of Iliad XVIII and the corresponding line 17 of Odyssey iv, which I will quote in Extract 4-D, we read τερπόμενος in the case of the Odyssey and τερπόμενοι in the case of the Iliad.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref38" name="_ftn38">[38]</a> The verb melpesthai ‘sing-and-dance’ at line 604 of Iliad XVIII is picked up by the corresponding noun molpē ‘singing-and-dancing’ at line 606. This noun here at line 606 continues to convey the idea of singing as started by the lead singer at line 604. The singing at line 606 is now choral, combined with the choral dancing that is being highlighted in the description. Despite this highlighting of choral dance, however, the aspect of choral song in the meaning of molpē as ‘signing-and-dancing’ is maintained. Revermann 1998:29 recognizes that molpē at line 606 refers to choral singing as well as dancing. In this context, he describes molpē as “this blunt and colourless noun.” I can agree only with the first part of this description.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref40" name="_ftn40">[40]</a> This criticism meshes with what I said in my earlier note about the ignoring of formulaic variants.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref41" name="_ftn41">[41]</a> There is an abbreviated version of this argument in HC 2§74.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref42" name="_ftn42">[42]</a> Comparable to the agōn ‘competition’ mentioned here by Thucydides (3.104.3) is the agōn ‘competition’ in mousikē ‘craft of the Muses’ at the festival of the Panathenaia, where the word mousikē includes the tekhnē ‘craft’ of rhapsōdoi ‘rhapsodes’. As my argumentation proceeds, I will have more to say about this Athenian agōn.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref43" name="_ftn43">[43]</a> I leave this word prooimion untranslated for now. It can be used with reference to the beginning of a humnos or ‘hymn’, as in the case of the Homeric Hymns. At a later point, I will analyze the technical meaning of this word and its etymology.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref44" name="_ftn44">[44]</a> On this aguia as the via sacra of Delos, see Aloni 1989:117-118.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref45" name="_ftn45">[45]</a> The word agōn ‘competition’ as used here by Thucydides (3.104.5) needs to be correlated with his use of the same word earlier on in the passage that I am quoting here (3.104.3).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref46" name="_ftn46">[46]</a> See my earlier note on this word.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref47" name="_ftn47">[47]</a> In HC 2§27n25, I make an argument for interpreting this word aphēmōs (ἀφήμως) to mean ‘without naming names’. The adjective ἄφημος was understood to be a synonym of ἀπευθής (as we see in the scholia to Aratus 1.270.2 ed. J. Martin 1974). This word ἀπευθής is used in the sense ‘without information’, as in Odyssey iii 88 and 184. When the Delian Maidens are asked to respond to the question ‘Who is the singer?’, they respond without naming names, that is, without giving information about the singer’s name. See also De Martino 1982:92-94. For a similar explanation, see also Burkert 1979:61.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref55" name="_ftn55">[55]</a> In the case of Pindar’s victory odes, for example, the speaking ‘I’ can make a mimesis of everyone and anyone who may be relevant to the act of praising the victor: the laudator, the laudandus, the kōmos, an optional khoros embedded within the kōmos, the ancestor, the athlete, the hero, and so on. Pindar’s odes also make mimesis of a wide variety of poetic functions, including what Bundy 1972 describes as a “hymnal” function (pp. 55-57). As Bundy shows, Pindar’s odes can even make mimesis of “the actual process of thought in arriving at its goal” (p. 59n59; see also pp. 61-62).</p>

Other examples of this type include Homeric Hymn (3) to Apollo 545-546, Homeric Hymn (4) to Hermes 579-580, Homeric Hymn (6) to Aphrodite 19-21, Homeric Hymn (10) to Aphrodite 4-6, Homeric Hymn (19) to Pan 48-49, Homeric Hymn (25) to the Muses and Apollo 6-7, Homeric Hymn (27) to Artemis 21-22, Homeric Hymn (28) to Athena 17-18, Homeric Hymn (29) to Hestia 13-14, Homeric Hymn (30) to Gaia 17-19, Homeric Hymn (33) 18-19 to the Dioskouroi. Further analysis in Nagy 2011d:328-329, where I note that these and other such examples of the expression ἄλλης … ἀοιδῆς have been described in terms of a “break-off formula” by Bundy 1972:52-53, even though he recognizes the “transitional” function of this formula (pp. 52 ). I find the term “break-off” misleading because it blunts the idea of “transitional” (for more on Bundy’s use of the term “transitional,” see his p. 87).</p>

Since the feminine form therapnē is related to the masculine therapōn, I suggest that the Delian Maidens as choral performers are surrogates of Apollo and, by extension, of his choral ensemble of Muses, just as the generic aoidos ‘singer’ in the Theogony is a surrogate of the Muses, and by extension, of their choral leader Apollo. On Apollo as a metonym for Apollo and the Muses in choral contexts, see PH 12§§29 (= pp. 350-351) and 58 (= p. 370). On therapōn ‘attendant’ in the earlier sense of ‘ritual substitute’, I refer again to BA 18§1-9 (= pp. 301-307), with special reference to the use of the epithet Μουσάων θεράπων ‘therapōn of the Muses’ in the Life of Archilochus and Life of Aesop traditions. On the Hesiodic model of Μουσάων θεράπων ‘therapōn of the Muses’ (Theogony 100), I refer again to GM 47-51. With reference to the word therapnai ‘attendants’, consider also the Laconian place-name Therapna (Serapna), which I interpret as a metonym like Mukēnē, Thēbē, and so on (on these place names, see HTL 163).</p>

# Iliad 18.603-606

<p>In the Homeric textual tradition, there are traces of a longer version of the narrative here, containing verses 603–604–605–606, to be contrasted with a shorter version containing 603–604–606. The shorter version, which was favored by the editor Aristarchus, elided the “signature” of Homer as analyzed in the comment on I.18.590–606. By contrast, the longer version highlights this “signature.” The shorter version is what was ultimately preserved in the medieval manuscripts of Homer, while the longer version was lost. But this longer version can be reconstructed by way of attestations that we find in a source that dates back to the late second century CE, Athenaeus 5.180c–e and 181a–f. The reconstructed longer version is as follows: ‘|603 A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [<em>khoros</em>] that rouses desire, |604 and they were feeling delight [<em>terpesthai</em>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<em>melpesthai</em>] a divine singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |605 playing on the special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>]; two special dancers [<em>kubistētēre</em>] among them |606 were swirling as he led [<em>ex-arkhein</em>] the singing-and-dancing [<em>molpē</em>] in their midst’ (|603 πολλὸς δ’ ἱμερόεντα χορὸν περιίσταθ’ ὅμιλος |604 τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς |606 μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντoς ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους). By contrast, the attested shorter version is as follows: ‘|603 A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [<em>khoros</em>] that rouses desire, |604 and they were feeling delight [<em>terpesthai</em>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<em>melpesthai</em>] a divine singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |605 playing on the special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>]; two special dancers [<em>kubistētēre</em>] among them |606 were swirling as they led [<em>ex-arkhein</em>] the singing-and-dancing [<em>molpē</em>] in their midst’ (|603 πολλὸς δ’ ἱμερόεντα χορὸν περιίσταθ’ ὅμιλος |604 τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς |606 μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντες ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους). The deletions here are in line with the Greek text as I quote it, where we see an omission of the wording μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων. And my translation here follows the Greek text as I quote it, where we read ἐξάρχοντες and not ἐξάρχοντος. In the longer version, <em>melpesthai </em>‘sing-and-dance’ at I.18.604 and <em>molpē </em>‘song-and-dance’ at I.18.606 refer to the combined activities of singing and dancing by the <em>khoros</em>, and <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ at I.18.606 signals an individuated act of performance that interacts with the collective performance of a <em>khoros</em>. In the shorter version, by contrast, the very presence of such an individuated act in a choral context is elided. In later comments, there will be further analysis of I.18.603–604–(605–)606 by way of comparing O.04.017–018, O.08.370–379, O.13.024–028. Already now, in any case, this much can be said: a formulaic analysis of both the longer and the shorter versions of I.18.603–604–(605–)606 indicates that both versions are compatible with Homeric diction, suiting different phases in the evolution of this diction as a formulaic system. In an earlier phase of such an evolution, Homer could be appreciated as a lead singer interacting with choral performance; in a later phase, by contrast, he would be recognized only as a soloist who recites epic verses.  </p>

<p>The time has come for Achilles to re-enter the war against the Trojans. For this to happen, Agamemnon must first settle with Achilles. But the over-king feels the need to say more than simply to formulate his proposed terms of settlement. His aim is to excuse himself from responsibility for dishonoring Achilles, and the story that he tells in order to achieve this aim is a retelling of a cosmic <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that resulted in the Labors of Hēraklēs. Such a retelling, however, is destined to backfire: it will result in further damage to his own royal status and in further advancement for the heroic prestige of Achilles, for whom Hēraklēs now becomes a perfect model.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/156108001.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Herakles at the tree of the Hesperides, holding three of the golden apples in his left hand.

# Iliad 19.3–17

<p>The goddess Thetis proceeds to bring for Achilles the armor that was made for him by the god Hephaistos, I.19.003, and she finds the hero embracing the body of Patroklos and weeping over it, mourning together with all his fellow warriors, the Myrmidons, I.19.004–006; she now makes a formal presentation of the armor to Achilles, I.19.007–013. At the sight of this armor, all the Myrmidons recoil: no one can bear to look at the divine work of art, I.19.014–015—no one, that is, except for Achilles, who now looks directly at the Shield, I.19.015–017, and whose eyes, as he is looking, now give off a terrifying <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’, I.19.017. The first time we saw this word <em>selas</em> in the <em>Iliad</em> was at I.08.076, where it referred to the lightning that comes from Zeus as he thunders from on high on the top of Mount Ida—and this flash of light brings holy terror for the Achaeans, I.08.076–077. See the comment on I.08.066–077. There is a comparable reference at I.17.739 to the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ in a thunderstorm. See the comment on I.17.736–741. Other evocative occurrences of <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ include the references at I.08.509 and at I.08.563 to the threatening fires of the Trojans. And we see yet again this powerful word in the context of I.15.599–600: it is said there that Zeus has been waiting to see with his own divine eyes the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’, I.15.600, that will appear when the first of the beached Achaean ships is set on fire. <em>Once this divine vision is visualized, the Will of Zeus will have been fulfilled</em>. Thus this word <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ signals the driving force of the whole epic, which is the Will of Zeus. See the comment on I.15.592–602. Another powerful moment where the Will of Zeus manifests itself as a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ happens at I.18.214, where this word refers to the fire that bursts from the head of the enraged Achilles. See the comment on I.18.214. With regard to I.15.599–600, I also note a coextensiveness between the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ at I.15.600 and the terrifying look of Zeus. I deliberately use the word <em>look</em> here because, unlike other English words for the act of seeing, the verb <em>look</em> and the noun <em>look</em> or <em>looks</em> can refer to a stream of vision not only as it comes into the eye but also as it goes out of it. Zeus can look at the terrifying flash of light when the beached ship of Protesilaos is set on fire, but that look of his can translate into the terrifying flash of light that comes out of his own eye in the act of his casting his thunderbolt. Zeus hurls his thunderbolt by casting his eye on the target: see the comment on I.13.242–244. I see a comparable pattern of coextensiveness here at I.19.015–017: the selas ‘flash of light’ at I.19.017 that comes from the terrifying look of Achilles as he looks at the Shield will translate into a flash of light that comes from the Shield itself: only Achilles dares to look at it, while the other Myrmidons shrink back in terror, avoiding the gaze.  </p>

# Iliad 19.015–017

<p>This detail about Achilles as the only hero who can look at the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from his Shield, I.19.017, is relevant to a myth about the blinding of Homer. I epitomize here from my analysis in Nagy 2016.02.18§§11–12 (via HPC 256–257n13). In the Life of Homer traditions, Vita 6 (see the inventory of Words and Ideas), there is a myth that explains the blinding of Homer as the result of a mistake he made. He conjured the poetic vision of Achilles wearing the new set of bronze armor that the divine smith Hephaistos had made for him. Here is my translation of the text (Vita 6.46–50): ‘Visiting the tomb of Achilles, he [= Homer] prayed if he could only see the hero just the way the hero was like at the moment of entering the field of battle while wearing his second set of armor. The hero then appeared to him, and, as soon as Homer looked at the hero, he was blinded by the gleam [<em>augē</em>] of the armor’ (ἐλθόντα γὰρ ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀχιλλέως τάφον εὔξασθαι θεάσασθαι τὸν ἥρωα τοιοῦτον ὁποῖος προῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν μάχην τοῖς δευτέροις ὅπλοις κεκοσμημένος· ὀφθέντος δ’ αὐτῷ τοῦ Ἀχιλλέως τυφλωθῆναι τὸν Ὅμηρον ὑπὸ τῆς τῶν ὅπλων αὐγῆς). This heroic moment, when Achilles finally returns to the field of battle, is what we have just read at I.19.014–017, where it is said that the gleam emanating from the new bronze armor of Achilles was so blindingly bright that none of his fellow warriors could even look directly at it. It is this gleam that blinds Homer himself, who is imagined as the only poet in the whole world who could conjure such a blinding vision in his own poetry. </p>

<p>In this speech of Achilles, he himself refers to his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ by way of the verb <em>apomēniein</em> at I.19.062 (ἀπομηνίσαντος). This anger has been the main theme of the <em>Iliad</em> ever since I.01.001, and Achilles now expresses regret over the many deaths that resulted for his Achaean companions. The speech of the hero here contains also other words that are relevant to <em>mēnis</em>: of special interest are <em>meneainein</em> ‘get angry’ at I.19.058 (μενεήναμεν) and <em>mimnēskein</em> ‘remind’ at I.19.064 (μνήσεσθαι). Both of these words convey a sense of mental reciprocity in the feelings of anger as experienced by both heroes. See the comments on I.01.207 and I.01.247. See also <em>The Best of the Achaeans</em>, 73 and 312. In the present speech, Achilles goes so far as to regret that he and Agamemnon quarreled over Briseis. If only she had died, he says at I.19.059–060, on the day when he captured her after he conquered the city of Lyrnessos. But Achilles stops short of saying that he regrets having conquered Lyrnessos.</p>

<p>The <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles has now finally been ‘un-said’ by the hero, as expressed by the verb <em>apo-eipeîn</em>, I.19.075. The response of the Achaeans as an aggregate is a collective feeling of joy, as expressed by the root <em>khar</em>- of the verb <em>khairein</em> in the sense of ‘rejoice’. By contrast, while the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ was still ongoing, the Achaeans had collectively felt grief, as expressed by the root <em>akh</em>- of the verb <em>akhnusthai</em> ‘feel grief’ and of the noun <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’. See especially the comments on I.01.188 and on I.01.509. Such a semantic contrast between collective joy and collective grief is re-enacted in names like <em>Khari-lā(u̯)os</em> and <em>*Akhi-lāu̯os</em>. The second of these two names is my reconstruction of an older form of the name <em>Akhil(l)leús</em>: see the comment on I.01.002. (BA 77, 79; also 65).  </p>

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, Hēraklēs, atē ‘aberration’, aitios ‘responsible’, the apology of Agamemnon

# Iliad 19.076–138

<p>In seeking to settle his quarrel with Achilles, Agamemnon claims that he was not <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’, I.19.086. Rather it was <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ or ‘derangement’ that that made him ‘act deranged’, <em>aâsthai</em>, I.19.091. This word <em>aâsthai</em>, which can be translated more literally as ‘veer off-course’, functions here as the verb for the noun <em>atē</em>, which can be translated correspondingly as ‘veering off-course’. In what follows, I can even translate the noun <em>atē</em> simply as ‘mistake’ and the verb <em>aâsthai</em> as ‘making a mistake’. In the verses that are being covered in this general comment, here are the occurrences of <em>aâsthai</em> in the sense of ‘make a mistake’ and functioning as the verb that matches the noun <em>atē</em>: I.19.091, I.19.095, I.19.113, I.19.129, I.19.136, I.19.137. In juridical terms, <em>atē</em> can refer either to a mistake that you made or to the damages that you have to pay to remedy that mistake. The mistake is the cause of the damages, and the damages are the effect of the mistake. And, since <em>atē</em> can refer either to the cause or to the effect of the mistake, it can be personified as a malevolent goddess <em>Atē</em> who presides over the whole process of cause-and-effect. That is why Agamemnon can say that I am not <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’, but Zeus and his entire divine apparatus are responsible, since they inflicted on me the goddess <em>Atē</em>. In effect, the goddess <em>Atē</em> made me do it. In the verses that are being covered in this general comment, here are the occurrences of <em>atē</em>/<em>Atē</em>: Ι.19.088, Ι.19.091, Ι.19.126, Ι.19.129, I.19.136. Agamemnon has more to say about the personified <em>Atē</em>: this goddess had once upon a time caused even Zeus himself to make a big mistake. That mistake resulted in the epic traditions about Hēraklēs, analyzed in the comment on I.19.95–133. But, happily for the gods, <em>Atē</em> no longer lives in Olympus: she was thrown out of there by Zeus for having caused him to make a mistake, and she landed on Earth, where she could now cause trouble only for us humans. We are the ones who make mistakes, while the Olympians no longer make mistakes—now that <em>Atē</em> cannot go back to Olympus. I see at work here a theological fact of life: in the age of myth, gods used to make mistakes, but not today in the age of ritual.</p>

# Iliad 19.076–082

<p>The following is epitomized from <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, 1§36. Agamemnon, who is the high king among all the kings of the Achaean warriors participating in the war at Troy, is speaking here in a public assembly of the Achaeans. Strangely, he speaks to his fellow warriors while remaining in a seated position, I.19.077, saying that it is a good thing to listen to a man who speaks in a standing position and that it is hard for even a good speaker to <em>hupoballein</em> (ὑββάλλειν) him, I.19.080. So, what does this mean? Achilles had just spoken to the assembly at verses I.19.056–073, and it is made explicit at I.19.055 that he was standing. In the Greek-English dictionary of Liddell, Scott, and Jones (LSJ), <em>hupoballein</em> is interpreted as ‘interrupt’ in the context of I.19.080 here. A related context is the adverb <em>hupoblēdēn</em> (ὑποβλήδην) at I.01. 292, where Achilles is responding to Agamemnon in the course of their famous quarrel. Some translate that adverb as ‘interruptingly’ (details in <em>Plato's Rhapsody and Homer's Music: The Poetics of the Panathenaic Festival in Classical Athens </em>(= <em>PR</em>), 20). Instead, I interpret <em>hupoballein</em> and <em>hupoblēdēn</em> as ‘speak in relay [after someone]’ and ‘speaking in relay’ respectively, and I argue that the concept of relay speaking is a characteristic of competitive speech-making (<em>PR</em> 21–22). As Richard Martin has shown, the <em>Iliad</em> can dramatize Agamemnon and Achilles in the act of competing with each other as speakers, not only as warriors and leaders, and Achilles is consistently portrayed as the better speaker by far (Martin 1989:117; also 63, 69–70, 98, 113, 117, 119, 133, 202, 219, 223, 228). At I.01.292, where I interpret <em>hupoblēdēn</em> as ‘speaking in relay’, Achilles engages in verbal combat with Agamemnon not so much by way of ‘interrupting’ but by picking up the train of thought exactly where his opponent left off—and out-performing him in the process. So, here at I.19.080, Agamemnon backs off from verbal combat with Achilles, using as an excuse the fact that he is wounded: I can’t stand up, and therefore I can’t compete by picking up the train of thought where Achilles left off—and therefore I can’t out-perform him (and perhaps I don’t anymore have the stomach even to try to do so). The successful performer remains standing, and the unsuccessful performer fails to stand up and compete by taking his turn, choosing instead to sit it out. He will still speak to Achilles, but he will speak without offering any more competition (<em>PR</em> 22).</p>

# Iliad 19.84–85

<p>Agamemnon says that he will say a <em>mūthos</em>, and the word occurs twice here: I.19.084, I.19.085. As Richard Martin (1989) has shown, this word as used in Homeric poetry means ‘wording that is spoken for the record’. Thus <em>mūthos</em> “is a speech-act indicating authority, performed at length, <em>usually in public</em>, with a focus on full attention to every detail” (Martin 1989:12). Another example of <em>mūthos</em> occurs at I.19.107, where it is Zeus who says something for the record, ‘wording spoken for the record’. In Homeric terms, any wording that is called a <em>mūthos</em> by the Master Narrator himself in the act of actually quoting the words of the wording will have the prestige of reality—to the extent that the listeners were actually expected to accept the idea that such wording had once upon a time been really spoken exactly as quoted. In short, any <em>mūthos</em> that is quoted in Homeric poetry must be real because it is suppsedly spoken for the record by Homer himself. The modern word <em>myth</em>, derived from post-Homeric uses of the word <em>mūthos</em>, has obviously veered from the Homeric meaning (HQ 119-125, 127-133, 152).  </p>

tags: the epic narrative about Hēraklēs, Hērā, kleos 'glory' (of poetry), antagonism between immortal and mortal, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, atē ‘aberration’

# Iliad 19.95–133

<p>The epic narrative about Hēraklēs as retold here by Agamemnon, would never have happened if Zeus had not made a mistake, as indicated by the verb <em>aâsthai</em> ‘make a mistake’ at I.19.095, also at I.19.113. This verb, as I noted in the comment on the overall passage, I.19.076–138, corresponds to the noun <em>atē</em>, which I originally translated there as ‘aberration’. To say it more formally, then: the epic narrative about Hēraklēs resulted from an aberration on the part of Zeus, who was deceived by his divine wife Hērā. Call it what you will, Zeus made a big mistake. He inadvertently allowed it to happen that Hērā, who is normally the goddess in charge of perfect timing in the cosmos, threw off the timing for the birth of Hēraklēs, so that the hero’s cousin Eurystheus was born earlier and thus became king instead of Hēraklēs. Even though Hēraklēs was by far superior as a hero, he was now by birth forever socially inferior to Eurystheus, and throughout his life he was obliged to undertake seemingly impossible tasks that were imposed on him by his malevolent cousin. But Hēraklēs prevailed in performing these tasks, which became the famed Labors of Hēraklēs, as indicated by the programmatic word <em>aethloi</em> ‘labors’ at I.19.133, and these Labors conferred on Hēraklēs a poetic <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that became the epic tradition of Hēraklēs. It is these same epic traditions that Agamemnon is now retelling. This retelling, it must be added, is subversive. In the very act of retelling the epic narrative about Hēraklēs, Agamemnon is inadvertently undermining his own status: just as Eurystheus was socially superior but heroically inferior to Hēraklēs, so also Agamemnon is socially superior but heroically inferior to Achilles. One big question still remains about this whole epic narrative: why is the name of Hēraklēs connected to the name of Hērā, who was the direct cause of the the social inferiority experienced by the hero? Why does the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of <em>Hēraklēs</em> have the meaning ‘he who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of Hērā’? The answer is evident: if it had not been for the intervention of Hērā, Hēraklēs would never have had to perform his Labors, and, if it had not been for these Labors, he would never have won the <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ that was his to keep forever. We see here the positive side of myths about <em>antagonism between immortal and mortal, divinity and hero</em>.  </p>

<p>Having finished at I.19.134 with the retelling of the epic narrative about Hēraklēs, Agamemnon now comes back to his admission that it was <em>atē</em> for him to dishonor Achilles, I.19.136. This word, as we have seen, can be translated as ‘aberration’ or ‘derangement’ or even simply ‘mistake’. In the present context, the noun <em>atē</em> is paired twice with the verb <em>aâsthai</em>, at both I.19.136 and I.19.137, and I translate this verb here simply as ‘make a mistake’. Agamemnon then declares his readiness to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.19.138. This gesture brings us back to I.09.115, where Agamemnon had already admitted his <em>atai</em> ‘aberrations’ in dishonoring Achilles, adding at I.09.120 that he was ready to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’ for these aberrations. See the comment on I.09.115–120. </p>

tags: theoeikelos ‘looking like a god’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 19.155

<p>This epithet <em>theoeikelos</em> ‘looking like a god’ occurs only two times in the <em>Iliad</em>. Besides the occurrence here, I.19.155, we see it also at I.01.131. In both cases, the referent is Achilles. In Song 44 of Sappho, “The Wedding of Hector and Andromache,” the same epithet <em>theoeikeloi</em> ‘looking like gods’ occurs in the plural at line 34 (θεοεικέλο[ις]), applying to Hector and Andromache together. The act of comparing humans to divinities is a conventional trope in the ritual context of weddings, and so the application of the epithet <em>theoeikeloi</em> ‘looking like gods’ to Hector and Andromache on the happy occasion of their wedding is perfectly understandable. Most commonly, the bride is equated with Aphrodite and the bridegroom, with Ares. See the comment on I.18.492 (also H24H 4§§14–21). But there may be an irony in the application of the same epithet <em>theoeikelos</em> ‘looking like a god’ to Achilles in the <em>Iliad</em>, since this hero tragically dies before he can ever get married (H24H 5§§98–102, 110–114). Conversely, there may also be an irony in the application of <em>theoeikeloi</em> ‘looking like gods’ to Hector and Andromache in Song 44 of Sappho, since the lives of this couple, once happy, will now tragically be ruined by Achilles in his role as the bridegroom that never was: he will kill Hector and make Andromache a widow. This is not to say that the use of the epithet <em>theoeikeloi</em> ‘looking like gods’ in Sappho Song 44.34 evokes the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it. The evocation may center on a local epic tradition that was current in the Aeolic song culture of Lesbos. The doomed triad of bride and bridegroom and killer of bridegroom was surely involved in such a local tradition as well. Another sign of such a free-standing Iliadic tradition originating from a distinctively Aeolian song culture is the occurrence of the expression <em>kleos aphthiton</em> ‘imperishable glory [<em>kleos</em>]’ in the same song, Sappho 44.5. This expression corresponds exactly to the expression we find in the <em>Iliad</em>, <em>kleos aphthiton</em> ‘imperishable glory [<em>kleos</em>]’, as spoken by Achilles himself about his own poetic glory at I.09.413. The two matching expressions, in Song 44 of Sappho and in <em>Iliad</em> 9, are cognate with each other both in wording and in metrical positioning. See the comment on I.09.413. So, the doomed triad of bride and bridegroom and killer of bridegroom are not only part of comparable stories about the different kinds of doom that await each one of the three: they are also part of two comparable media, both of which are meant to make eternal the poetic ‘glory’ or <em>kleos</em> of all three. One of these two media has just barely survived, in Song 44 of Sappho. The other of the two, by contrast, became the definitive form of epic, as represented by the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>.  </p>

In the present context, this kind of equitability is drawn into a parallel with the noun <em>dikē</em> in the sense of a ‘judgment’, I.19.180. Such ‘judgment’ likewise needs to be equitable.

# Iliad 19.282-302/ anchor comment on: lament by Briseis

<p>The wording of Briseis in addressing the corpse of Patroklos is not just a speech expressing her sorrows: morphologically, it is a song of lament. In what follows, I make ten points about this lament:</p><p>Point 1. On the morphology of lament, see already the comment on the wording of Andromache at I.06.407–439. It is worth repeating here a caution as expressed in that comment: the laments of characters quoted by epic do not represent the actual meter of lamentation as sung in real laments. The genre of epic regularly uses its own meter, which is the dactylic hexameter, in representing other genres that it quotes, including unmetrical genres (see again Martin 1989:12–42; also pp. 87–88, specifically on lament). But the morphology of laments quoted by epic still follows the rules of lament. </p><p>Point 2. In the case of the lament performed by Briseis here at I.19.282–302, the song is a performance by a group of captive women, led in this case by Briseis herself. Such a performance involves not only singing but also dancing, to be visualized as a stylized form of swaying accompanied by gestures such as beating the chest. See the comment on I.18.051–060, where we see Thetis and her Nereid sisters performing a song of lament for Achilles as if he were dead already. To be noted is the reference there at I.18.050–051 to the gesture of beating the chest. Such a group performance by Thetis and the other Nereids is <em>choral</em>, in the sense that the Greek word <em>khoros</em> can be defined as ‘a group of singers/dancers’: see the comment at I.18.590–606. And the same description applies to the group performance by Briseis and the captive women here at I.19.282–302: once again, the performance is <em>choral</em>. </p><p>Point 3. The occasion for a <em>choral performance</em> can be sad, as in the case of the laments led by Thetis and Briseis, or it can be happy: see the comment on I.18.590–606, where we see a description of a merry celebration at the time of a harvest.</p><p>Point 4. Viewed in such a larger context, the lament of Briseis can be seen as a masterpiece of verbal artistry. This song of lament starts as if it were a wedding song, not a lament, since Briseis is envisioned at I.19.282 as an eroticized bride who matches the goddess Aphrodite herself in beauty and gracefulness. On the convention of comparing the bride to a goddess, especially to Aphrodite, see the comments on I.18.492 and I.19.155. But as soon as Briseis sees the corpse of Patroklos, all cut up by the sharp bronze, I.19.283, happy thoughts about weddings now turn to sad thoughts about funerals. She instantly starts weeping bitterly and singing her song of lament.</p><p>Point 5. The vision of Patroklos all cut up by the sharp bronze leads to another vision. In the back of her mind is another vision, stored in her memory. It is a vision of the husband she once had, Mynes. Just as she now sees the corpse of Patroklos, all cut up by the sharp bronze, I.19.283, she remembers seeing the corpse of her husband Mynes, all cut up by the sharp bronze, I.19.292. But the sad image of Mynes, who had once been the bridegroom of Briseis, brings back happy memories as she thinks of her own wedding—and of songs sung at that wedding. Such thoughts now evoke the sad image of Achilles, that bridegroom-to-be who will not live long enough ever to become a bridegroom—and who has killed the happy thoughts of Briseis about a bridegroom in her own past. It was Achilles, Briseis keenly remembers, who had killed her lover Mynes and conquered the city of Lyrnessos, I.19.295–296, but she also remembers that Patroklos would not let her lament for Mynes, saying that Achilles would become her new lover, making her a bride of his own, I.19.297–299.</p><p>Point 6. So, the theme of a wedding song returns in this lament of Briseis, but there is a sad irony to it all, since there will never be any future wedding for the doomed bridegroom. There will be no marriage for Achilles. All that Achilles has done for Briseis is to kill off her own marriage to Mynes, and meanwhile the death of the kind and gentle Patroklos has cut short that hero’s own intermediacy in trying to arrange a marriage for Briseis and Achilles.  </p><p>Point 7. In her crying and singing, singing and crying, Briseis performs as a prima donna of lament. She is a distinctly choral personality, analogous to the personality of Sappho herself in the choral songs attributed to that Aeolian prima donna of a later era. (On Sappho as a choral personality, see PH 370, with reference to Calame 1977:367–377; also 126–127.) </p><p>Point 8. Meanwhile, the choral group of lamenting women who are likewise captives is singing and swaying in response to the lead song of Briseis, I.19.301–302. Here I epitomize from some relevant remarks in Nagy 2010a:23–24. The group is shown in the act of responding to the lament of Briseis by continuing it with their own lament, in antiphonal performance, at I.19.301: ‘So she [= Briseis] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). The verb <em>epi–stenakhesthai</em>, which I translate here as ‘wail in response’, is the conventional way for epic to signal an antiphonal performance in lamentation. See the anchor comment at I.24.720–776 on laments at Hector’s funeral.</p><p>Point 9. In singing her song of lament, Briseis as lead singer touches on her feelings as a captive woman who has become the war prize of Achilles—and who hopes to become his war bride. But she also touches on the projected feelings of the ensemble of captive women who respond to her lament in antiphonal song. These women too are war prizes, and they must therefore share in some ways the sorrows felt by the lead singer as she sings her lament. But the lead singer laments primarily the death of Patroklos and only secondarily her own misfortunes, while the ensemble of women who respond in antiphonal song are lamenting primarily their own misfortunes and only secondarily the death of Patroklos. Sorrow over the death of Patroklos seems to be the primary concern of Briseis—to the extent that her lament projects the sorrow of Achilles, which is a driving theme in the plot of the epic. By contrast, the sorrow expressed by the ensemble of captive women over their own misfortunes seems to be a primary concern only for them. Or is it? In what follows at Point 10, I argue that the overall lament will communalize the sorrow expressed by the epic narrative.  </p><p>Point 10. In the lament of Briseis, the sorrow of the captive women is projected as the primary sorrow of Briseis herself over her own misfortunes, which had been caused by the deaths of her husband and the rest of her family at the hands of Achilles. Briseis shows that she remembers that old sorrow, since her wording indicates that she had wanted to lament her dead husband in the same way that she now laments the dead Patroklos. That death in her past is relevant to the death of Patroklos in the present. And the love of Briseis for her husband and the rest of her family is relevant to her love for Patroklos as a stand-in for Achilles. There is a diversity of emotions here. And the antiphonal exchange of laments between the captive women and their lead singer leads to a communalization of these emotions. The example of Briseis, then, supports the argument that lament is a communalizing experience. It leads here to a communalization of diverse emotions. </p>

<p>As Achilles lifts the mighty Shield, there is a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ that streams from its bright surface, I.19.374, which is compared to the radiant light that streams from the moon; then this same <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from the surface of the Shield at I.19.374 is also compared to a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from a fire that sends forth its light from a lighthouse, I.19.375. This saving light, with its promise of salvation for sailors lost at sea who are longing to be reunited with their loved ones at home, I.19.375, I.19.377–378, streams from a fire that is burning at a remote place described here as a solitary <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ situated in the heights overlooking the dangerous seas below, I.19.376–377. By way of ring-composition, the description now returns, I.19.379, to the picturing of the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ that is streaming from the Shield. This flash of light is aptly compared here to the moon, not to the sun, since it is nighttime, not daytime: the sailors who are lost at sea are literally in the dark, desperately looking for a light to orient them. And the source of the light as a blazing fire is most appropriate not only from a practical point of view, since a strong fire is needed for sending from the lighthouse a light strong enough to be spotted in the darkness from far away at sea, but also from a symbolic point of view, since the burning looks that emanate from the angry eyes of Achilles are compared at an earlier point to a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ that emanates from a blazing fire, I.19.366 (πυρὸς σέλας). On the angry looks of Achilles as he streams fire from his eyes and lights up the surface of his Shield, see the comment on I.19.003–017. As for the lighthouse that sends forth the light of salvation to sailors lost at sea, it is visualized as a solitary <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ situated on the heights overlooking the sea, I.19.376–377. Such a <em>stathmos</em>, as I indicate in the comment on I.18.587–589, can be visualized more precisely as a herdsman’s shelter that looms over the shores of the Hellespont, where the ship of Achilles is beached. This shelter is actually the tomb of Achilles, located on a high promontory that reaches into the Hellespont. See the anchor comment at I.23.125–126 on the tomb of Achilles, part 1, and the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257 on the tomb of Achilles, part 2; also to be noted is the anchor comment at O.24.076–084 on the tomb of Achilles, part 3, posted in 2017.01.03. Here at I.19.373–380, the gleam from the bronze surface of the Shield is being compared to the light that streams from the blazing fire of a lighthouse marking the tomb of Achilles, and this comparison can be seen as a metaphor for the overwhelmingly radiant prestige of the Bronze Age.  </p>

# Odyssey 20

<p>By now Achilles has a new set of armor, and he is ready to fight the Trojans. But his first major opponent seems to be a distraction. At least, our initial impression may lead us to think that there is a distraction going on here. The first major opponent of Achilles in <em>Iliad</em> 20 is Aeneas, hero of epic traditions that eventually became absorbed into the <em>Aeneid</em> of Virgil. Is this hero, we may ask, a truly worthy opponent of Achilles? Are the epic traditions that figure this son of Aphrodite / Venus truly worthy of the epic that is the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>? Once we examine more closely the oldest Greek epic traditions of Aeneas, it will become clear that this hero is indeed a most important opponent of Achilles, in that he represents ancient Greek epic traditions that are different from and antithetical to the epic tradition that prevailed in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> as we know it. Not only does Aeneas challenge Achilles: even the epic traditions that figure Aeneas will challenge the epic traditions that figure Achilles. To say it another way, Aeneas represents a proto-Aeneid that challenges the proto-Iliad of Achilles. What makes Aeneas and his Aeneid—or, better, Aeneids—such a formidable challenge to Achilles is the enormous political prestige of the epic tradition that backs up Aeneas. By virtue of being the son of Aphrodite/Venus, Aeneas possesses a genealogical and dynastic charisma that threatens to overshadow the purely epic charisma of his Iliadic opponent Achilles.  </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Luca_Ferrari_-_Venus_preventing_her_son_Aeneas_from_killing_Helen_of_Troy_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Venus preventing her son Aeneas from killing Helen of Troy,” Luca Ferrari, circa 1650. <br/>Luca Ferrari [Public domain], via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Luca_Ferrari_-_Venus_preventing_her_son_Aeneas_from_killing_Helen_of_Troy_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><u><a>.</a></u></p>

# Iliad 20.001–074

<p>Zeus convenes a council of divinities. Many gods and goddesses are invited, and they all assemble, I.20.005–006. Included are all kinds of local divinities who preside over locales of their own, such as gods of various rivers and goddesses of various wildlands, I.20.007–009. A detail is ostentatiously added here: all the river gods actually attend the council—with the notable exception of Ōkeanos, I.20.007. This council of the divinities, held on Mount Olympus, is different from other such councils, which normally exclude local divinities and include only those gods and goddesses who are imagined as living on Mount Olympus together with Zeus. What, then is this special occasion? Or, to put it in terms of the question that Poseidon asks of Zeus, I.20.015, what is the Will of Zeus here? In response, Zeus tells Poseidon that, yes, the Will of Zeus is now at work, I.20.020, and he proceeds to say what he wants to happen: while Zeus stays behind on Mount Olympus, the other divinities may now proceed to the battleground of the Trojan War, and they will be allowed to give their individual help to whichever side they favor, Trojan or Achaean, I.20.021–030. Accordingly, the divinities now travel to the battlefield, I.20.31–40, and they are listed as follows: Hērā, Athena, Poseidon, Hermes, Hephaistos, Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Xanthos, and Aphrodite. Included in this list, almost surreptitiously, is the local river god Xanthos, I.20.40. On the battlefield, the divinities line up in opposition to each other, and the matches that are highlighted are: Poseidon and Apollo at I.20.057–068, Ares and Athena at I.20.069 (also already at I.20.047–052), Hērā and Artemis at I.20.70–71, Leto and Hermes at I.20.072, Hephaistos and Xanthos at I.20.073–074. Missing, so far, from any further matchings is Aphrodite. Later, at I.21.415–433, we will see that this goddess does in fact get involved in the upcoming conflict of divinities, but not as a combatant in her own right. For the moment, what is most striking about this list of matchings is the prominence given to the river god Xanthos at I.20.073–074. And, as we learn here at I.20.074, the immortals call this river god Xanthos, but mortals call him Skamandros. See also the comment on I.02.811–815. This name Skamandros, latinized as Scamander, refers to the most important river in the region of Troy. On this river, see already the comments on I.08.220–227 and I.11.497–500. As we will see later, in the comment on I.21.001–021, the role of Scamander as the local river god of the Trojans is vitally important for the plot of <em>Iliad</em> 21.</p>

# Iliad 20.089–102

<p>Aeneas tells about a past encounter with Achilles in an epic story that is situated outside the time-frame of the <em>Iliad,</em> I.20.089–102. At a later point, I.20.187–194, the story will be supplemented by what Achilles himself says about such an encounter. As we will see, what Achilles says at that later point reflects a different though related version of the same story. In the story as told by Aeneas here at I.20.089–102, he was pasturing his cattle in the highlands of the mountain range known simply as Mount Ida, and Achilles evidently caught him off guard in a cattle-raid, I.20.090–091. Aeneas, as he was being pursued by Achilles, fled from the highlands of Mount Ida all the way down to the coastland in the south. The general direction of the flight of Aeneas is indicated by a detail about the pursuit by Achilles. After he chased Aeneas down from the heights of Mount Ida, Achilles conquered the cities of Pedasos and Lyrnessos, I.20.092. As we know from other contexts, I.06.034–035 and I.21.086–087, Pedasos was a city situated near the river Satnioeis, and we know from Strabo 13.1.50 C605 that this river flowed into the Gulf of Adramytteion at the coastline situated to the southwest of Mount Ida. As for Lyrnessos, it was situated further off to the east along the coastline, as we know from Strabo 13.1.60 C611. Whereas Lyrnessos was inhabited by <em>Kilikes,</em> as noted in the anchor comment at I.02.689–693 with reference to Strabo 13.1.7 C586, Pedasos was inhabited by <em>Leleges,</em> as we read at I.21.086–087. The story as told by Aeneas explains how he succeeded in escaping from Achilles: at I.20.092–093, Aeneas boasts that he received the divine aid of Zeus himself, who gave to him the superhuman speed that he needed to run away from that most prodigious of all runners, Achilles. As for the story as told by Achilles at I.20.187–194, we will see in the comment on those verses that there are added details about the escape of Aeneas from Achilles, and that some of those details do not mesh with the version of the story as told by Aeneas.</p>

# Iliad 20.187–194

<p>Achilles tells about a past encounter with Aeneas in an epic story that is situated outside the time-frame of the <em>Iliad</em>, I.20.187–194. The story supplements what Aeneas says at I.20.089–098 about such an encounter, where that hero tells a different though related version of the same story. The differences are highlighted in the story as told by Achilles here at I.20.187–194, where we find additional details about the escape of Aeneas from Achilles. According to this version of the story, Aeneas seems to have escaped from Achilles not once but twice: after Aeneas ran down from the highlands of Mount Ida and reached the coastland without getting caught by Achilles, he found refuge in the city of Lyrnessos, which Achilles then destroyed—but without catching him, since Aeneas somehow escaped, I.20.190–194. In this narrative, Achilles knows that it must have been the gods who made it possible for Aeneas to escape, but he does not know the exact identity of the god who actually rescued that hero: the wording of Achilles is ostentatiously vague when he refers at I.20.194 to the action of ‘Zeus and other gods’ in rescuing Aeneas from the besieged city of Lyrnessos before Achilles destroyed it. This vagueness about the interference of the gods is relevant to what will happen in the upcoming encounter between Aeneas and Achilles. As we will see in the comment on I.20.290–352, Achilles will be literally kept in the dark about the identity of the god who will rescue Aeneas from being killed when the two heroes finally engage in mortal combat. That said, I return to my focus on the second escape of Aeneas from Lyrnessos—following his first escape when he ran down to that city from the highlands of Mount Ida. The details we have seen about the second escape explain why only Lyrnessos is mentioned in the version of the story as told by Achilles, unlike the version as told by Aeneas, where both Pedasos and Lyrnessos are mentioned. The second escape of Aeneas, from a besieged city, could only have happened at one of the two cities of Pedasos and Lyrnessos, which were both ultimately destroyed by Achilles. Aeneas could not have been present in two besieged cities <em>at the same time</em>. I propose, then, that Pedasos and Lyrnessos were alternative places of refuge for Aeneas in alternative versions of his story, just as these same two cities had been alternative places of residence for Briseis in alternative versions of her own story, as I noted in the comment on I.16.057. In yet another story, there was yet another city from which Aeneas escaped before it was completely destroyed. The dramatic time of this other story, unlike the stories we have just considered about the cities of Pedasos and Lyrnessos, comes after rather than before the dramatic time of the <em>Iliad</em>. This other story is about the city of Troy itself, and, in this story as well, Aeneas managed to escape before the city was completely destroyed. The story was told in an Ionian epic that belonged to the epic Cycle, and the name of this epic was the <em>Iliou Persis</em> ‘Destruction of Ilion’, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, Proclus summary p. 107.24–26 ed. Allen 1912.  </p>

# Iliad 20.200–258

<p>In this speech, Aeneas speaks to Achilles from the standpoint of an epic tradition that glorifies primarily Aeneas, not Achilles. At I.20.200, Aeneas uses the word <em>epea</em> ‘words’ in referring negatively to the earlier speech of Achilles, I.20.178–198, where Achilles had spoken from the standpoint of an epic tradition that glorified primarily Achilles. This word <em>epea</em>—pronounced as <em>epē</em> in prose—normally means simply ‘words’ when it is used inside of epic diction, but it can also mean ‘words of poetry’ when it is used outside of such diction in contexts referring to poetry, especially to epic poetry. In prose, this kind of usage leads to the explicit meaning of <em>epē</em> as ‘epic poetry’. And, exceptionally, such a meaning of <em>epē</em> can even occur within the diction of epic poetry itself. That is what seems to be happening in the context of I.20.200, where <em>epea</em> refers to the words of Achilles as if they were the ‘poetic words’ of epic—that is, as if these words were the equivalent of epic itself. Do not try to intimidate me, Aeneas says to Achilles at I.20.200–201, by telling <em>epea</em> ‘words’ about past epic events like our mutual encounter in the highlands of Mount Ida and beyond. Yes, some epics will glorify you, but there are other epics that will glorify me instead. See further in the comment below on I.20.248–250. By implication, Aeneas is saying here that he has access to a different though related version of epic events, and that such a version will glorify him at the expense of Achilles. In fact, the entire speech of Aeneas at I.20.200–258 is a glorification of this hero by way of an epic tradition that is different from though related to the tradition that glorifies Achilles. This different tradition, as Aeneas goes on to demonstrate, glorifies primarily Aeneas himself. Meanwhile, the poetic implications of the word <em>epea</em> as ‘epic’ now become more explicit at I.20.203–205. Aeneas says here that he and Achilles know stories about each other not because they have been eyewitnesses to these stories, I.20.205, but because they both have heard, as other listeners have also heard, the <em>epea</em> that are the stories, and these <em>epea</em> are <em>pro-kluta</em> ‘glorious’, I.20.204. In this context, then, the word <em>epea</em> comes close to meaning ‘epics’, since the idea of <em>pro-kluta</em> as poetically ‘glorious’ is linked with the etymology of this adjective as ‘prominently heard’, just as the idea of <em>kleos</em> as a poetic kind of ‘glory’ is linked with the etymology of this noun as ‘the thing that is heard’. See the comment on I.02.484–487. Also relevant to the sense of <em>epea</em> as ‘words of poetry’ is the mutual negativity of the rivalry that is ongoing here between the two different epic traditions about Aeneas and Achilles. For example, there is an insulting reference that Aeneas makes at I.20.211 to the <em>epea</em> as recounted by Achilles about Aeneas. Those <em>epea</em> or ‘words of poetry’, as a veritable ‘epic’ told by Achilles, were certainly negative about Aeneas, just as Aeneas is now speaking negatively about Achilles and about that hero’s role in those same <em>epea</em>. Such mutual negativity is expressed by way of using words of blame poetry as contained within the epic, even though epic sees itself as a form of poetry that engages primarily in words of praise. The negativity of blame poetry is actually signaled in the words of Aeneas at I.20.251, who uses the noun <em>neikea</em>, plural of <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’, in referring to the mutual negativity that the two heroes express in their speeches to and about each other. See further in the comment on I.20.244–256.  </p>

# Iliad 20.209/ anchor comment on: Aeneas the Ionian, part 1

<p>So, Aeneas in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> can boast about the eternal genes that make him the ideal ancestor of any dynasty that claims to be descended from him. And that is how, from the hindsight of world history, Rome could claim its destiny as the Eternal City. I have already noted that Strabo (13.1.53 C608), after listing various dynasties in the past that had been vying with each other for possession of Aeneas as their ancestor, concludes by acknowledging Rome as the world power that ultimately won out in claiming Aeneas as its founder. And Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> can go down in history as a most powerful statement of such a claim. But what about the era when the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> took shape? Does this epic make a claim that is comparable to what we see in the <em>Aeneid</em> of Virgil? Such questions need to be consolidated and asked retrospectively, not just prospectively, since the historically earlier cases where dynasties claimed descent from Aeneas are not nearly as well attested as is the case of Rome. So, the consolidated question is this: from the standpoint of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, was there any existing political power that could have claimed ownership, as it were, of Aeneas? The answer is simple: there did exist some grouping of Ionians that had such power, and, for them, <em>Aeneas was an Ionian</em>. But the details, as we will see in what follows, are complicated. And, to complicate things further, there were two phases of Ionian ownership, which I summarize here in the form of two points to be made from the start.</p><p>Point 1. [Epitomized from HPC 196–197.] The first of two phases for an Ionian ownership of Aeneas can be traced back to the seventh century BCE or perhaps even earlier. It was a time when the Ionians of the Ionian Dodecapolis in central Asia Minor, dominated by the Ionian city of Miletus, were continuing to expand their influence in northern Asia Minor. One sign of such expansionism was the success of these Ionians in making inroads into the region of ancient Troy in northern Asia Minor and establishing there a new Troy, as it were. Such success is reflected in the Ionian epic tradition. The primary example is the Ionian epic of the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus. Here I offer a brief review of the relevant parts of this epic (Proclus summary p. 107.24–26 ed. Allen 1912):</p><p>After Troy was completely destroyed by the Achaeans, a handful of  prominent survivors sought to find alternative places to live. The most  prominent of these survivors of Troy’s total destruction was the hero  Aeneas: foreseeing the destruction that was about to happen, he  withdrew from the doomed city and moved to a palace he established in  the highlands of Mount Ida. </p><p>This version of the Aeneas story matches not only the plot of the epic <em>Iliou Persis</em>. It matches also the local mythology of the city of Scepsis, located in the region of Mount Ida. As we learn from Strabo (13.1.53 C607), Demetrius of Scepsis claimed explicitly that the <em>basileion</em> ‘royal palace’ of Aeneas was in the city of Scepsis. The idea of a royal city founded by Aeneas in the region of Mount Ida reflects the political interests of Ionians in general, not only of Scepsis in particular. To make this point, I start by focusing on two details reported by Demetrius of Scepsis by way of Strabo (13.1.52 C607):</p><p>A. The city of Scepsis, after being founded by Aeneas, was later ruled  jointly by Ascanius (<em>Askanios</em>) son of Aeneas and Scamandrius  (<em>Skamandrios</em>) son of Hector.  </p><p>B. The population of Scepsis was augmented at a later period by  immigrants from the Ionian city of Miletus.  </p><p>Scepsis had a special meaning for Ionians not only because this city was supposedly the site of the palace of the hero Aeneas but also because the ancient site of Troy was supposedly located within its territory, in the highlands of Mount Ida. Here was the <em>kōmē</em> ‘village’ of the <em>Ilieis</em> ‘people of Ilion’, a site that Demetrius of Scepsis claimed was the real ancient Troy, while the Aeolian site of Ilion, some 30 stadium-lengths to the northwest, was supposedly a false Troy (Strabo 13.1.35–36 C597–598; also 13.1.25 C593). So, the Trojan War, according to this Ionian version, supposedly happened in territory that Ionians once claimed as their own. In this version, ancient Troy was totally destroyed and then later reoccupied as a mere village, while Aeneas established at Scepsis a new city of Troy for the surviving Trojans. And the relocation of Aeneas to Scepsis at a time that anticipated the total destruction of ancient Troy now made it possible for the new Troy that was Scepsis to become the legitimate heir to the Trojan heritage—all within the framework of Ionian territory. In terms of this particular Ionian version of the Trojan War, everything happened within the Ionian territory of Scepsis. In contrast to this version of the Trojan War, which suited the interests of the Ionians, the Aeolians made a rival claim: that Troy was in fact not totally destroyed and that some of its population survived to rebuild the old city, originally called either Troy or Ilion, as the New Ilion, or, more simply, Ilion. See the anchor comment at I.09.328–333 about efforts of Aeolians to possess ancient Troy and its environs in the historical period. This rival version of the Aeolians was actively promoted by the historian Hellanicus of Lesbos, whose publications can be dated as far back as 406 BCE (scholia for Aristophanes <em>Frogs</em> 694). Hellanicus in his <em>Trōïka</em> (FGH 4 F 25b), as mediated by Strabo (13.1.42 C602), says that the city of New Ilion was in fact the same place as the old Ilion, that is, ancient Troy. Strabo (again, 13.1.42 C602) remarks that this claim of Hellanicus—who was a native of Aeolian Lesbos—reflects the historian’s partiality toward the people of the Aeolian city of New Ilion. Modern archaeology, however, has proved that the claim of the Aeolians as represented by Hellanicus of Lesbos was basically right and that the rival claim of the Ionians as later represented by Demetrius of Scepsis was wrong. There is in fact no historical or archaeological support for the claim that the old Ilion, ancient Troy, was located in the Ionian territory of Scepsis. Here I return to the Ionian version as restated by Demetrius and then by Strabo (13.1.35–36 C597–598; also 13.1.25 C593). According to this version, as we saw, the site of the old Ilion was the <em>kōmē</em> ‘village’ of the <em>Ilieis</em> ‘people of Ilion’ in the territory of Scepsis, some thirty stadium-lengths away from New Ilion. Despite the fact, however, that Demetrius thinks of this ‘village’ as the site of ancient Troy, he concedes (via Strabo 13.1.38 C599) that he could see absolutely no trace of any epic ruins there.</p><p>Point 2. [Epitomized, radically, from HPC 143–146.] The second of two phases for an Ionian ownership of Aeneas can be traced back to an era that starts, by my estimation, somewhere around the late seventh century BCE. The city of Athens, which was emerging as a primary representative of Ionian identity at that time, was making its own inroads into the region of ancient Troy, eventually establishing there a new Troy of its own by occupying and reconfiguring the city of Sigeion, which had been formerly an Aeolian stronghold. The formerly Aeolian identity of Sigeion is noted by Strabo 13.1.25 C593. As for the reconfigured Ionian identity of Sigeion as a new Troy, I refer again to Points 6 and 8 in the anchor comment at I.09.328–333. This reconfigured city of Sigeion as a new Troy became a rival of another new Troy, Ilion, which had been built by the Aeolians on the foundations of what remained of the old Troy, as noted at Points 1–5 in the same anchor comment at I.09.328–333. See also anchor comment at I.20.302–308 on: Aeneas the Ionian, part 2; and anchor comment at I.20.302–308 on: Aeneas the Aeolian.  </p>

# Iliad 20.209

<p>In boasting about his own genealogy, the hero Aeneas uses the verb <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’ here at I.20.209, thus making a most definitive epic statement of identity. When the genealogy is completed at I.20.241, the verb <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’ recurs, indicating the simultaneous completion of the boast. For Aeneas, an all-important aspect of his lengthy genealogy is his most immediate genetic link: as this hero boasts by way of that most solemn word <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’ here at I.20.209, he is the son of Aphrodite herself. And, from this goddess of sexuality, who is the embodiment of eternal regeneration, Aeneas has inherited what could best be described as eternal genes, as it were. Such an arresting <em>idea</em> is at the same time a political <em>ideology</em>, since any dynasty that can claim Aeneas as ancestor is thereby destined to be regenerated, successor after successor, for all eternity. There is evidence, as noted by Strabo 13.1.53 C608, for the existence of dynastic powers that did in fact claim Aeneas as their ancestor. In the end, though, only one of these powers noted by Strabo actually succeeded in making permanent such a claim. That power was Rome, and, retrospectively, the surviving record that made such a claim permanent was of course the <em>Aeneid</em> of Virgil, which tells how Aeneas escaped from Troy before it was completely destroyed and how he traveled all the way to Italy, where he became the originator of the world power that became Rome.  </p>

On this point, see the general comment on the speech of Aeneas at I.20.200–258. And the basic fact about that entire speech of Aeneas is a fact of genealogy.

# Iliad 20.230–241

<p>As we learned previously from I.20.215–219, the foundational proto-Trojan king named Erikhthonios was fathered by an even earlier proto-Trojan king named Dardanos. The narrative of the genealogical succession now continues at I.20.231–241: Erikhthonios fathers Trōs, whose name means ‘Trojan’; so, from here on, the succession of kings is no longer proto-Trojan but Trojan; then Trōs fathers Ilos and Assarakos; then Ilos—whose name presupposes the alternative name of Troy, Ilion—fathers Laomedon who fathers Priam, but Assarakos fathers Kapys who fathers Anchises; finally, Priam fathers Hector but Anchises fathers Aeneas. There is a match here in the chronological sequencing for the king Erikhthonios of Troy and for the king Erikhthonios of Athens. The Athenian king Erikhthonios was a differentiated mythological by-form of another Athenian king, Erekhtheus. Such a differentiation can probably be dated as far back as the late seventh century BCE, when the Athenians gained control of Sigeion, a city that now became their very own new Troy. See Point 2 in the anchor comment at I.20.209 about Aeneas the Ionian, part 1. What resulted from this differentiation was a set of two different kings located in two different zones of time within the genealogical sequence of Athenian kings. The earlier location of Erikhthonios in this Athenian genealogy matches chronologically the location of Erikhthonios in the Trojan genealogy that culminates in Aeneas. According to the Parian Marble (FGH 239 section 23), Troy was conquered in 1209/8 BCE, and that event would have happened roughly three centuries after an event that coincides with the era of the Athenian king Erikhthonios: according to the Parian Marble (FGH 239 section 10), the Athenians claimed that Erikhthonios was the inventor of the four-horse chariot for the occasion of the first chariot race held at the first Panathenaic festival in 1505/4 BCE. So, the differentiation of the Athenian Erekhtheus into an earlier Erikhthonios and a later Erekhtheus made it possible to connect more easily the Athenian Erikhthonios with the Trojan Erikhthonios, ancestor of Aeneas. This way, the prestige of the Trojan genealogy, culminating in the dynastic figure of the epic hero Aeneas, could be appropriated into the Athenian genealogy of kings. A signal of such an Athenian appropriation in the <em>Iliad</em> is a pointed reference at I.05.271 to four chariot-horses owned by Anchises, father of Aeneas, to be complemented by two chariot-horses owned by Aeneas himself. I.05.272. The narrative introduces these two sets of chariot-horses by revealing at I.05.263–270 that Anchises secretly bred six horses from the original set of chariot-horses given by Zeus to Trōs in compensation for the abduction of the king’s son, Ganymede; of these six, he kept four for himself and gave two to Aeneas, I.05.271–272. As we have already learned from the Parian Marble (FGH 239 section 10), the Athenians claimed that Erikhthonios was the inventor of the four-horse chariot for the occasion of the first chariot race held at the first Panathenaic festival in 1505/4 BCE. So, the Iliadic reference to the four-horse chariot team of Anchises is an implicit Athenian signature. To be contrasted are the two-horse chariot teams used by almost all warriors—including Aeneas himself, I.05.270–272—for fighting battles in the Trojan War. An exception is the four-horse chariot team used by Hector, I.08.185. He too, like Aeneas, is a descendant of Dardanos, I.20.240. So here again we see the makings of an implicit Athenian signature.  </p>

# Iliad 20.248–250

<p>The word <em>epea</em> is used here at I.20.249 to mean not only ‘words’ but also, more specifically, ‘words of poetry’, such as the words of epic. The words of poetry are spoken here in an act of boasting-which is framed within the act of performing epic. See the general comment on I.20.200–258; see also the earlier comment on I.12.387–391. Here at I.20.248–250, Aeneas is cautioning Achilles about the variability of <em>epea</em> as ‘poetic words’. There is a wide range of different ways of saying different things. Different epics, Aeneas is saying in effect, can have different truth-values in different places. What is said in a positive sense at one place may be said in a negative sense at another place. That is the nature of <em>mūthoi</em>, I.20.248, which are ‘wordings spoken for the record’. For more on the Homeric sense of this word <em>mūthos</em> as ‘wording spoken for the record’, see the comment at I.19.084–085. As I noted in that comment, any wording that is called a <em>mūthos</em> by the Master Narrator himself in the act of actually quoting the words of the wording will have the prestige of reality—to the extent that the listeners were actually expected to accept the idea that such wording had once upon a time been really spoken exactly as quoted by Homer himself. In the context of I.20.248–250 here, however, it becomes clear that there were in fact different regional versions of epics as quoted, as it were, by Homer. As Aeneas says at I.20.248–249, there is no single <em>mūthos</em> in the sense that there is no single way of wording a story for the record: rather, there are many ways of wording a story, and so there are many <em>mūthoi</em> to be heard by listeners, not just one. And, to repeat, there is a wide range of different ways of saying different things. As Aeneas says it, I.20.249, the <em>nomós</em> or ‘range’ of <em>epea</em> as ‘words of poetry’ is vast, varying from place to place. The choice of wording here is most evocative: the word <em>nomós</em> can mean literally ‘range of lands used for pasturing’, as at I.02.475, and the metaphorical application here to the wide range of epics about Aeneas and Achilles may evoke a pastoral scene of a cattle-raid in the highlands of Mount Ida, where Achilles was once upon a time rustling the cattle that were pastured there by Aeneas. Such a pastoral scene is signaled in the story as told by Aeneas at I.20.089–102: he was pasturing his cattle in the highlands of Mount Ida, and Achilles evidently caught him off guard in a cattle-raid, I.20.090–091. See the comment on I.20.089–102.  </p>

# Iliad 20.290–352

<p>In the short-term logic of the narrative here about the one-on-one battle between Aeneas and Achilles, I.20.290–352, it becomes certain that Aeneas will lose the battle and be killed by Achilles, I.20.290. But now, most abruptly, this short-term certainty is contradicted by a long-term certainty, which is, that Aeneas must not be killed by Achilles. It simply cannot happen. And the divine agent of this long-term certainty is the god Poseidon, who notices what is happening short-term and will now intervene directly, I.20.291, in order to insure the long-term certainty that Aeneas must not be killed in this battle-scene. As Poseidon declares to his fellow divinities before he takes action, it is <em>morimon</em> ‘destined’ that Aeneas must avoid being killed by Achilles at this epic moment, I.20.302, since Aeneas as a descendant of Dardanos must not die without having further descendants of his own, I.20.303–306, and these descendants may then continue to rule over the Trojans even after Troy is completely destroyed, I.20.307–308. So, there is an eternity that is destined for the genes, as it were, of Aeneas, as I noted already in the anchor comment at I.20.209, since this hero’s descendants will have eternal rule over the Trojans. But this rule, says Poseidon, will not be in Troy, since both Hērā and Athena have committed themselves by oath to the complete destruction of that city, I.20.313–317. Having made these declarations, Poseidon now takes action. What happens right away is that Aeneas is literally lifted into the air by the power of the god, I.20.325, who spirits him away to a safe place that is removed from the battle scene, I.20.328–329. Once Aeneas is safe, Poseidon appears to him and declares that it would have been <em>huper moiran</em> ‘beyond fate [<em>moira</em>]’ for this hero to die at this epic moment, I.20.336. And, while Poseidon is taking action by rescuing Aeneas, he simultaneously beclouds the vision of Achilles, I.20.321–322, so that this hero cannot get to see the actual rescue of his opponent. Achilles is literally in the dark here. Then, after the rescue, the vision of Achilles is restored, I.20.341–342, and he now comprehends that some god must have arranged the escape of Aeneas, I.20.342–350. It is significant, however, that Achilles does not know the identity of the god who rescued Aeneas. Similarly, Achilles did not know the exact identity of the god who rescued Aeneas from the city of Lyrnessos, where that hero had once upon a time taken refuge from the pursuing Achilles. As I noted in the comment on I.20.187–194, the wording of Achilles is ostentatiously vague when he refers at I.20.194 to the action of ‘Zeus and the other gods’ in helping Aeneas escape from the besieged city of Lyrnessos before it was destroyed by Achilles. By contrast, the wording of Achilles is clear when he refers at I.20.192 to the action of Zeus and Athena together in helping him destroy Lyrnessos. I propose, then, that Achilles was kept in the dark about the agency of the god or goddess who helped Aeneas escape from Lyrnessos before it was destroyed, just as he is now being kept in the dark about the agency of Poseidon. Further, just as Achilles at I.20.194 is complaining about the divine help given to Aeneas, so also Aeneas at I.20.097–102 complains about the divine help given to Achilles—and there the one divinity who is singled out as that hero’s greatest divine helper is Athena, I.20.094–096. The implication of this complaint by Aeneas is that Athena gives to Achilles an unfair advantage, and that the two heroes would be evenly matched if Athena were taken out of the picture. Ironically, Athena is in fact out of the picture in the one-on-one battle between Aeneas and Achilles, and the only god who intervenes in this battle is Poseidon, who helps not Achilles but Aeneas. But, even with the help of Poseidon, Aeneas does not win the one-on-one battle. He succeeds only in escaping death at the hands of Achilles.  </p>

# Iliad 20.302–308

<p>The four points that are made in the other comment to I.20.302–308 about Aeneas the Ionian need to be juxtaposed with twelve points that now need to be made about Aeneas the Aeolian, as featured in rival traditions. [These twelve points are epitomized from HPC 197–201.]</p><p>Point 1. The Aeolians of New Ilion, unlike the Ionians of Scepsis, claimed that Troy was not totally destroyed and was not left uninhabited. Rather, the Aeolians converted the ruins of Troy into the city of New Ilion. Our source for such a claim is Strabo (13.1.40 C600), evidently following Demetrius of Scepsis, who reported the claim of the Aeolians but went on to dispute it. Strabo (13.1.42 C602), however, also cites an important textual source that supported the same claim, namely, the Trōïka of Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGH 4 F 25b). See Point 1 of the anchor comment at I.20.209. As we will see, this claim of the Aeolians as reported by Hellanicus meshes with the idea that the hero Aeneas was originally an Aeolian, not an Ionian.</p><p>Point 2. In terms of the Aeolian claims, according to which Troy was not completely abandoned after its capture by the Achaeans, there was not only a surviving population that stayed in old Ilion but also a dynasty that ruled over such a population. There are traces of a traditional narrative about such a dynasty in the <em>Trōïka</em> of Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGH 4 F 31), as reported by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Roman Antiquities 1.45.4–1.48.1): according to this narrative, Aeneas himself was at least indirectly involved in such a dynasty. In this role, Aeneas would have been not an Ionian but an Aeolian. Here is a summary of what Hellanicus says:</p><ol><li>After Aeneas escaped the capture of Troy by retreating to the highlands of Mount Ida, he negotiated with the victorious Achaeans his relocation to the city of <em>Aíneia</em> on the Thermaic Gulf.</li><li>Meanwhile, his son Ascanius was relocated as king of Daskylitis on the coast of the Sea of Marmara.</li><li>Eventually, Ascanius returned to the old Ilion, where he joined forces with Scamandrius (<em>Skamandrios</em>) son of Hector in refounding it as the New Ilion.</li></ol><p>Point 3. Another source, however, indicates that the joint rule of the descendants of Aeneas and Hector over New Ilion was not to last. Here is what we read in the Scholia for I.20.307–308: ‘but some say that the Aeolians expelled the descendants of Aeneas’ (οἱ δέ, ὅτι Αἰολεῖς ἐξέβαλον τοὺς ἀπογόνους Αἰνείου). Such a story about an expulsion from Ilion, it must be emphasized, could still be part of an Aeolic version of the story about ancient Troy. The wording here, if the text is not corrupt, would still assume an Aeolian re-founding of Ilion after the destruction of the ancient city.</p><p>Point 4. What is being problematized in the scholia that I have just cited is the prophecy made by the god Poseidon, in the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, concerning the descendants of Aeneas. The god is prophesying that these descendants, to whom I will refer hereafter simply as the <em>Aeneadae</em>, will survive the Trojan War and will rule their subjects forever, I.20.306–308, but the context makes it clear that this rule will never happen in the old city of Troy, which will have to be destroyed completely, I.20.309–317. For now, I emphasize one basic fact about this prophecy: it implies that the Aeneadae will have to be relocated from Troy. Such a story about a relocation, of course, does not have to follow the Ionian tradition about Scepsis as a final place of refuge for the Aeneadae. The Scholia for I.20.307–308, which we have already considered at Point 3, also report an alternative story about the relocation of the Aeneadae: ‘some say that it was by way of the Romans, with regard to whatever things the Poet knew on the basis of oracles emanating from the Sibyl’ (οἱ μὲν διὰ Ῥωμαίους φασίν, ἅπερ εἰδέναι τὸν ποιητὴν ἐκ τῶν Σιβύλλης χρησμῶν). So, the point made in the Iliadic text about the relocation of the Aeneadae could be explained in terms of a Roman appropriation of Aeneas: according to the Roman version, the Aeneadae were relocated from Ilion all the way to Italy, and such a relocation could still be explained in terms of the prophecy uttered by Poseidon at I.20.306–308.</p><p>Point 5. In terms of the Aeolian version of the story about the conquest of Troy by the Achaeans, as we saw at Points 1 and 2 above, the relocation of the Aeneadae was not predicated on the total destruction of Troy. The Aeolians, unlike the Ionians, did not need to own Aeneas in order to own their claim to ancient Troy, since an essential part of their overall claim was that they had built the city of New Ilion on the ruins of the original Ilion. As we have seen, our earliest source for the essentials of the Aeolian version of this story is the <em>Trōïka</em> of Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGH 4 F 31), as reported by way of Dionysius of Halicarnassus (Roman Antiquities 1.45.4–1.48.1). After the Trojan War, according to this Aeolian version of the story, New Ilion was ruled jointly by Ascanius the son of Aeneas and Scamandrius the son of Hector and by their descendants. But then, as we can see from the Scholia for I.20.307–308, the descendants of Aeneas were expelled from New Ilion by ‘the Aeolians’, so that New Ilion was in later times ruled exclusively by the descendants of Hector. The story about the expulsion of the Aeneadae by the Aeolians from Ilion can be seen as a political reaction to the adoption of Aeneas by Ionians who claimed this hero as the founder of their very own new Ilion.</p><p>Point 6. To be contrasted with the Aeolian tradition about the New Ilion is the Ionian tradition about Scepsis. In this case, as we have seen, our primary source is Demetrius of Scepsis by way of Strabo (13.1.52 C607). After the Trojan War, according to this version of the story, Scepsis was first ruled by Aeneas. Then it was ruled jointly by Ascanius the son of Aeneas and Scamandrius the son of Hector and by their descendants. But then it was ruled by a coalition including immigrants from the Ionian city of Miletus.</p><p>Point 7. Retrospectively, in terms of the Aeolian tradition about New Ilion, Scamandrius represents the Aeolians who dominated New Ilion while Ascanius represents Ionians who may have originally inhabited the city together with the Aeolians. Once the Ionians appropriated a rival new Ilion as supposedly founded by Aeneas, however, the Aeolian version of the story would have to change: accordingly, the Aeneadae would now have to be expelled from the city of New Ilion. If the Ionians wanted to designate Aeneas as the founder of their rival new Ilion, as in the case of Scepsis, then the Aeolians of New Ilion would no longer want to designate the Aeneadae as partners in the dynasty that ruled them. In terms of the Ionian tradition about Scepsis, by contrast, Scamandrius represents the non-Ionians who ruled jointly with the Ionians the relocated new Ilion that is Scepsis, and the dominantly Ionian character of this city is then reinforced by Ionians immigrating from Miletus, leader of the Ionian Dodecapolis. There is evidence for the intensification of the Ionian identity of Scepsis over time, at the expense of its formerly Aeolic identity: Leaf 1923:273 notes a shift from Aeolic to Ionic dialect in the language found on the coinage of Scepsis around the fifth century BCE (HPC 200n145).</p><p>Point 8. The conflicting Aeolian and Ionian myths about Troy after the Trojan War can be correlated with an eventual differentiation of New Ilion and Scepsis as respectively Aeolian and Ionian cities. We know by hindsight that New Ilion was in fact a predominantly Aeolian city, whereas Scepsis, once an Aeolian city, eventually shifted toward an Ionian identity. The earlier Aeolian identity of Scepsis matches the identification of the Aeolians with the descendants of Hector, who ruled the city jointly with the descendants of Aeneas (Strabo 13.1.52 C607). And, conversely, the later Ionian identity of Scepsis matches the identification of the Ionians with the descendants of Aeneas.</p><p>Point 9. This is not to say that the Aeneadae were all along perceived as Ionians. Their Ionian identity was merely a function of the eventual Ionian identity of some of the places where they were relocated after the Trojan War, such as Scepsis. That is why the identity of the Aeneadae remains Aeolian <em>if they are relocated to places that still have an Aeolian identity</em>. We see an example in a myth about Aeneas as retold by the mythographer Conon, who flourished in the first century BCE and CE. According to this source (Conon FGH 26 F 1.46), Aeneas founded a settlement in the region of Mount Ida but was later displaced from there by two surviving sons of Hector, namely by Oxynios and <em>Skamandros</em> (F 1.46.2); Aeneas then migrated to the Thermaic Gulf (F.1.46.3), where he founded the city of <em>Aíneia</em>, also known as <em>Aînos</em> (F.1.46.4). The same name <em>Aînos</em> applies to a city on the banks of the river Ebros; that city, and <em>Aíneia</em> as well, were Aeolian settlements.</p><p>Point 10. Reviewing the various myths about Scamandrius son of Hector, as mentioned in Point 7 (also about one <em>Skamandros</em> son of Hector, as mentioned in Point 9), I emphasize that not one of them is represented in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, according to which the Trojans of the future will be ruled exclusively by the descendants of Aeneas, not by any descendants of Hector. The wording comes from the god Poseidon himself, as we have seen at I.20.307–308. Strabo (13.1.53 C608) quotes these same Homeric verses and then proceeds to quote a variant version of I.20.307–308, according to which the Aeneadae will rule not only over the surviving Trojans but also over all humanity. Depending on whether we follow the first or the second of the two versions as reflected in these two textual variants, we can say that the population to be ruled by the lineage of Aeneas will be either the Trojans or all humanity, I.20.307. Either way, the point that is being made in both versions is that the lineage of Aeneas will last forever, I.20.307–308, whereas the lineage of Hector the son of Priam will be extinct, I.20.302–306. The same point is being made in a prophecy made by the goddess Aphrodite in the <em>Homeric Hymn (6) to Aphrodite</em> (196–197). So, the version of the myth that is validated by both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> is decidedly anti-Aeolian, not just pro-Ionian. The extinction of Hector’s descendants is a prerequisite in Homeric poetry as we have it.</p><p>Point 11. In terms of Homeric poetry, then, the future Trojans who are destined to be ruled by the descendants of Aeneas—and not by the descendants of Hector—could not be equated with the population of the New Ilion dominated by the Aeolians, who as we have seen ultimately expelled the descendants of Aeneas from their city, according to the Scholia for I.20.307–308. That much is not surprising any more—provided that we keep in mind the Ionian ideology that drives the myth in Homeric poetry as we have it. What is surprising, however, is that the Ionian ideology that we see at work in the myths stemming from Scepsis can still leave room for the descendants of Hector as well as the descendants of Aeneas. In terms of the Homeric version as we have it, the Trojans of the future cannot even be equated with the population of the would-be new Ilion that was Scepsis, who were ruled not exclusively by Ascanius the son of Aeneas but jointly by him and by Scamandrius the son of Hector and grandson of Priam, as we saw from the testimony of Demetrius by way of Strabo (13.1.52 C607). So, what kind of Ionian ideology prevailed in the Homeric version of the myth? I propose that this ideology originated from the city of Sigeion in the Ionian phase of its existence, at a time when it was dominated by Athens. The Trojans of the future as pictured in the prophecy of Poseidon were imagined as the population controlled by the would-be new Ilion that was Sigeion, and this population was to be ruled exclusively by the descendants of Aeneas, not of Hector. Tracing the history of Sigeion forward in time into the early fifth century BCE, I propose that the possession of this city by Athens made it a more prestigious would-be new Ilion than was Scepsis, which must have gone into a severe decline after its main source of support, the city of Miletus, was captured by the Persian Empire in 494 BCE. By contrast with Scepsis, Sigeion persisted as a rival of New Ilion until sometime in the Hellenistic period. By the time of Strabo, however, who flourished in the late first century BCE, the city of Sigeion no longer even existed: the geographer reports that the site where the city had once stood had been systematically demolished (13.1.31 C595). The most likely cause of the city’s total destruction, it may be added, was its history of rivalry with New Ilion. So, by the time of Strabo, which matches the time when Aeneas became definitively recognized as the founder of the world power that was Rome, the only Ilion that still mattered any more was the Ilion of the Aeolians. But these Aeolians, unlike the ultimately doomed Ionians of Sigeion, did not need an Aeolian Aeneas as their source of legitimation.</p><p>Point 12. Here I return one more time to the two Iliadic versions of the prophecy made by the god Poseidon to Aeneas, as reflected in the two attested textual variants that we have already considered at I.20.307–308. According to the variant in one version, as quoted by Strabo (13.1.53 C608), the lineage of Aeneas will rule all of humanity, not only the Trojans of the future. Besides the textual variant that is cited by Strabo here to support this version, there is also another similar variant cited by other sources in support of the same version, as we read in the Scholia for I.20.307 (see HPC 200n144, where it is suggested that the source for such a variant was Aristonicus, contemporary of Strabo). As we read in Strabo (13.1.27 C594–595), this version of the Aeneas story became suitable for appropriation by the lineage of Julius Caesar, who claimed to be descended from Iulus, alternatively named Ascanius, who was the son of Aeneas. In terms of this version, the descendants of Aeneas would one day rule all humankind, in that the Roman imperial rule of Caesar followed by Augustus and by their successors was viewed to be universal. According to the other version, on the other hand, it was the Trojans themselves who would be ruled forever by the descendants of Aeneas, and these future Trojans would have been equated with the population of Sigeion—until, as we saw at Point 11, that city was totally destroyed in the Hellenistic period. Meanwhile, the population of New Ilion remained Aeolian well into the Roman period, without ever needing Aeneas as a legitimator of their Aeolian identity.</p>

Strabo (13.1.53 C608) quotes these same Homeric verses and then proceeds to quote a variant version of I.20.307–308, according to which the Aeneadae will rule not only over the surviving Trojans but also over all humanity. Depending on whether we follow the first or the second of the two versions as reflected in these two textual variants, we can say that the population to be ruled by the lineage of Aeneas will be either the Trojans or all humanity, I.20.307. Either way, the point that is being made in both versions is that the lineage of Aeneas will last forever, I.20.307–308, whereas the lineage of Hector the son of Priam will be extinct, I.20.302–306. The same point is being made in a prophecy made by the goddess Aphrodite in the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (6) <em>to Aphrodite</em> (196–197). So, the version of the myth that is validated by both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> is decidedly anti-Aeolian, not just pro-Ionian. The extinction of Hector’s descendants is a prerequisite in Homeric poetry as we have it.</p><p>Point 11. In terms of Homeric poetry, then, the future Trojans who are destined to be ruled by the descendants of Aeneas—and not by the descendants of Hector—could not be equated with the population of the New Ilion dominated by the Aeolians, who as we have seen ultimately expelled the descendants of Aeneas from their city, according to the scholia for I.20.307–308. That much is not surprising any more—provided that we keep in mind the Ionian ideology that drives the myth in Homeric poetry as we have it. What is surprising, however, is that the Ionian ideology that we see at work in the myths stemming from Scepsis can still leave room for the descendants of Hector as well as the descendants of Aeneas. In terms of the Homeric version as we have it, the Trojans of the future cannot even be equated with the population of the would-be new Ilion that was Scepsis, who were ruled not exclusively by Ascanius the son of Aeneas but jointly by him and by Scamandrius the son of Hector and grandson of Priam, as we saw from the testimony of Demetrius by way of Strabo (13.1.52 C607). So, what kind of Ionian ideology prevailed in the Homeric version of the myth? I propose that this ideology originated from the city of Sigeion in the Ionian phase of its existence, at a time when it was dominated by Athens. The Trojans of the future as pictured in the prophecy of Poseidon were imagined as the population controlled by the would-be new Ilion that was Sigeion, and this population was to be ruled exclusively by the descendants of Aeneas, not of Hector. Tracing the history of Sigeion forward in time into the early fifth century BCE, I propose that the possession of this city by Athens made it a more prestigious would-be new Ilion than was Scepsis, which must have gone into a severe decline after its main source of support, the city of Miletus, was captured by the Persian Empire in 494 BCE. By contrast with Scepsis, Sigeion persisted as a rival of New Ilion until sometime in the Hellenistic period. By the time of Strabo, however, who flourished in the late first century BCE, the city of Sigeion no longer even existed: the geographer reports that the site where the city had once stood had been systematically demolished (13.1.31 C595). The most likely cause of the city’s total destruction, it may be added, was its history of rivalry with New Ilion. So, by the time of Strabo, which matches the time when Aeneas became definitively recognized as the founder of the world power that was Rome, the only Ilion that still mattered any more was the Ilion of the Aeolians. But these Aeolians, unlike the ultimately doomed Ionians of Sigeion, did not need an Aeolian Aeneas as their source of legitimation.</p><p>Point 12. Here I return one more time to the two Iliadic versions of the prophecy made by the god Poseidon to Aeneas, as reflected in the two attested textual variants that we have already considered at I.20.307–308. According to the variant in one version, as quoted by Strabo (13.1.53 C608), the lineage of Aeneas will rule all of humanity, not only the Trojans of the future. Besides the textual variant that is cited by Strabo here to support this version, there is also another similar variant cited by other sources in support of the same version, as we read in the scholia for I.20.307 (see HPC 200n144, where it is suggested that the source for such a variant was Aristonicus, contemporary of Strabo). As we read in Strabo (13.1.27 C594–595), this version of the Aeneas story became suitable for appropriation by the lineage of Julius Caesar, who claimed to be descended from Iulus, alternatively named Ascanius, who was the son of Aeneas. In terms of this version, the descendants of Aeneas would one day rule all humankind, in that the Roman imperial rule of Caesar followed by Augustus and by their successors was viewed to be universal. According to the other version, on the other hand, it was the Trojans themselves who would be ruled forever by the descendants of Aeneas, and these future Trojans would have been equated with the population of Sigeion—until, as we saw at Point 11, that city was totally destroyed in the Hellenistic period. Meanwhile, the population of New Ilion remained Aeolian well into the Roman period, without ever needing Aeneas as a legitimator of their Aeolian identity.

# Iliad 20.403–405

<p>[Epitomized from HPC 229–230.] Here at I.20.404–405, the bellowing of a mortally wounded Trojan warrior is compared to the bellowing of a bull that is about to be sacrificed on the occasion of a ritual that was central to the people of the Ionian Dodecapolis in worshipping the god Poseidon. Such a comparison, which occurs in a context that is proximal to the narrative about the rescue of Aeneas by Poseidon, I.20.290–352, evokes the Ionian connections of the god with Aeneas as a hero who was appropriated by the Ionians of the Ionian Dodecapolis: see Point 4 of the anchor comment at I.20.302–308 about Aeneas the Ionian, part 2. Strabo (8.7.2 C384) makes it explicit that the Ionians even in his own time worshipped Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em> and celebrated (<em>thuein</em>) the festival of the Panionia at the Panionion: ‘even today, the Ionians honor [<em>tīmân</em>] him [= Poseidon], and they still celebrate [<em>thuein</em>] at that place [= the Panionion] the festival of the Panionia’ (ὃν καὶ νῦν ἔτι τιμῶσιν Ἴωνες, καὶ θύουσιν ἐκεῖ τὰ Πανιώνια). And he proceeds to describe this festival as a <em>thusiā</em> ‘sacrifice’ in the context of noting that Homer actually mentions it here at I.20.404–405: ‘he [= Homer] makes mention, as some suggest, of this sacrifice [<em>thusiā</em>] when he says …’ (μέμνηται δ’, ὡς ὑπονοοῦσί τινες, ταύτης τῆς θυσίας Ὅμηρος ὅταν φῇ … [the quotation from Homer follows]). I draw special attention to Strabo’s metonymic use of <em>thusiā</em> ‘sacrifice’ here to designate the whole festival of the Panionia. The geographer then proceeds to quote the verses at I.20.404–405 that concern the sacrifice of a bellowing bull to Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em>: ‘as when a bull | bellows when he is being dragged toward the lord who is <em>Helikōnios</em>’ (ὡς ὅτε ταῦρος | ἤρυγεν ἑλκόμενος Ἑλικώνιον ἀμφὶ ἄνακτα). As Strabo observes (again, 8.7.2 C384), the climax of the festival of the Panionia at the Panionion is the sacrifice of the bull to Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em>—I note the word <em>thusiā</em>, used here in the specific sense of ‘sacrifice’—and special care must be taken by the sacrificers to induce the bull to bellow before it is sacrificed. Accordingly, Strabo continues, the reference at I.20.404–405 to the sacrifice of a bellowing bull to Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em> can be used to argue that the birth of Homer ‘the Poet’ par excellence is to be dated after the Ionian <em>apoikiā</em> ‘migration’, on the grounds that Homer actually mentions the Panionian sacrifice of the Ionians to Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em> in the environs of Priene: ‘they use [this] as evidence for aguing that the Poet was born after the Ionian migration [<em>apoikiā</em>], given that he makes mention of the Panionian festival [<em>thusiā</em>] that the Ionians celebrate in the territory of the people of Priene in honor of Poseidon <em>Helikōnios</em>’ (τεκμαίρονταί τε νεώτερον εἶναι τῆς Ἰωνικῆς ἀποικίας τὸν ποιητήν, μεμνημένον γε τῆς Πανιωνικῆς θυσίας ἣν ἐν τῇ Πριηνέων χώρᾳ συντελοῦσιν ῎Ιωνες τῷ ῾Ελικωνίῳ Ποσειδῶνι). As we see from Strabo, then, this Homeric passage may well refer to the special way of sacrificing bulls at the festival of the Panionia at the Panionion in Priene. The testimony of Strabo is in fact corroborated by the Homeric scholia (<em>b</em>T for I.20.404). As we see from the context of the Iliadic passage here, the mode of inflicting the mortal blow in sacrificing the bull highlights the vitality of the bull, who is “pumped up” with fear and rage. In the scholia <em>b</em>T for I.20.406a (see also <em>b</em>T for 404b), the commentator takes great care in noting the explosion of arterial blood at the climactic moment when the sacrificial blow severs the carotid artery of the “pumped up” animal. It appears that this mode of sacrificing the bull intensifies the rush of arterial blood spurting from the sacrificial blow.  </p>

Achilles is right behind them, in hot pursuit, slaughtering left and right the fleeing Trojans. The hero seems unstoppable. But Achilles meets his match when he provokes the river god Scamander, whose clear streams he has polluted with the gore of countless Trojans that he slaughters while they are desperately attempting to ford the god’s river. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/29_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman. <br/><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:(29)_Flaxman_Ilias_1793,_gestochen_1795,_185_x_275.jpg">Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>

tags: Asteropaios, river gods, Axios, Akhelōios, Ōkeanos, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, eukhesthai ‘claim’

# Iliad 21.184–199

<p>In this speech of Achilles, the hero is boasting, as expressed by way of the solemn word <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘claim’, I.21.187, about his genealogy as son of Peleus son of Aiakos son of Zeus himself, I.21.188–189. The point of the boast that Achilles makes here is that his genealogy is superior to that of the hero Asteropaios, whom he has just killed, I.21.139–183. This hero of the Trojans, as we learn at I.21.130–143, is the grandson of the river god Axios. Provocatively, Achilles is boasting that the lineage of Zeus, from which he is descended, is superior to the lineage of any river god, I.21.193–199, and, in this context, Achilles mentions by name two of the mightiest river gods: Akhelōios at I.21.194 and Ōkeanos at I.21.195. Even the Ōkeanos, Achilles goes on to say, would be defeated by Zeus in a one-on-one combat of cosmic proportions, I.21.196–199. This whole speech of Achilles is of course a direct provocation to the river Scamander, I.21.136–138. As we saw previously at I.20.74, the name of this river Scamander, <em>Skamandros</em> in Greek, is also the name of the river god who embodies the river, and that is how mortals address the god of the river, as Scamander, while Xanthos is the name that the gods themselves give to him. See the comment on I.20.001–074. Thus the river god Scamander can take it personally that Achilles here is insulting not only the river god Axios, from whom his dead enemy Asteropaios was descended, but also all river gods. And Achilles goes even further: he insults Scamander directly, declaring earlier at I.21.130-132 that the river god had failed to rescue the Trojans- despite the fact that they would customarily offer sacrifices of bulls and stallions to Scamander, I.21.131-132.  </p>

# Iliad 21.194–197

<p>In his edition of Homer, Zenodotus athetized—that is, he rejected as non-Homeric—the verse at I.21.195, as we know from the scholia for this verse in the Geneva manuscript of the <em>Iliad</em>. (On Zenodotus and on athetesis, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) At I.21.195, Ōkeanos is named as the referent of the relative clause at I.21.196–197, where Ōkeanos is described as a cosmic river that has always been the ultimate source for all the water in the world. If this verse at I.21.195 were omitted, then the referent for this description of the ultimate source for all water would shift from the river Ōkeanos to the river Akhelōios, which is named at verse 194. Zenodotus’ rejection of verse 195 was not the result of some arbitrary editorial decision: there is external evidence for an alternative textual tradition of the <em>Iliad</em> where this verse 195 was in fact missing, and there is also external evidence for an alternative oral poetic tradition where Akhelōios rather than Ōkeanos figures as the primal stream that generates all other streams (HC 2§196; also D’Alessio 2004). For example, Pausanias 8.38.10 follows a version of I.21.194–197 that does not include the verse we know as I.21.195. Similarly, at I.18.483–608 in his edition of Homer, Zenodotus athetized the entire sequence of verses that narrated the images displayed on the Shield of Achilles. By dissociating the world of the Shield from the world of Homer, Zenodotus also dissociated the Ōkeanos, the cosmic river that ever encircles and defines the Shield at I.18.607-608. See the comment on I.18.483–608. Unlike Zenodotus, however, Aristarchus in his edition of Homer refrained from athetizing the verses describing the images on the Shield at I.18.483–608 (HC 2§198, with reference to primary and secondary sources). So, he did not athetize the verses about the Ōkeanos at I.18.607–608; nor did he athetize the verse about Ōkeanos at I.21.195 (again, HC 2§198, with reference to primary and secondary sources). Here we have the clearest indication that all these verses were conventionally thought to belong to the Homeric tradition—even in the age of Aristarchus. (On Aristarchus, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) Viewing the differences between Zenodotus and Aristarchus in their editorial treatment of Homeric passages involving the Ōkeanos, we can see that Zenodotus was more extreme than Aristarchus in his efforts to purge Homeric poetry from what he considered to be Orphic elements. At the other extreme was Crates, whose edition of Homer did not treat the supposedly Orphic elements as extraneous to Homeric poetry (HC 2§199). For more on Orphic elements in Homeric poetry and on the occasional preservation of such elements in the edition of Homer by Crates, see the comment on I.14.245–246–246a. (On Crates in general, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) In view of what what we know, then, about the textual transmission of I.21.194–197, I argue that both the longer version, featuring Akhelōios and Ōkeanos, and the shorter version, featuring only Akhelōios, are authentic multiforms. On <em>multiform</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas. And, what is more, Homeric poetry recognizes both versions as multiforms. Here I return to the comment on I.20.001–074, where I noted that Ōkeanos is ostentatiously singled out at I.20.007 as the only river god who did not attend the council of divinities that Zeus had assembled in his divine plan to allow those attending to intervene in the ongoing struggle between the Achaeans and the Trojans. Just as this river god Ōkeanos is ostentatiously present in the story by way of being specially marked as absent at I.20.007, so also now he can continue to be ostentatiously present at I.21.195 by not being marked as absent in the longer version—or he can continue to be present by being ostentatiously absent from the words of insult formulated by Achilles in the shorter version, just as he was absent also from the original council of the divinities. The river god Scamander, by contrast, was not absent but present at that council, and he did intervene in the war, since he was provoked to fight Achilles not only by that hero’s actions when he was slaughtering droves of Trojans in the waters of the river but also by that earlier boast where Achilles claimed to be superior in genealogy to heroes who were descended from river gods. It was in the context of that boast, as I noted in the comment on I.21.184–199, that Achilles had insulted Scamander. But he also insulted Ōkeanos and Akhelōios in one version of I.21.194–197. Or at least, according to the other version, he also insulted Akhelōios. Considering that Achilles was almost destroyed by Scamander, we may infer an even worse outcome for the hero if he had faced in combat not this local river god but rather the cosmic river gods Akhelōios or Ōkeanos. By implication, Akhelōios chose not to intervene, though he was present, whereas Ōkeanos could not intervene, since he was absent. Through its multiformity, then, the Homeric tradition acknowledges both a potential presence and a potential absence for Ōkeanos. </p>

tags: battle between Achilles and the river god Scamander, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 21.200–327

<p>Outraged by all the carnage caused by Achilles as that hero relentlessly keeps slaughtering droves of Trojans and clogs the river with their bloody corpses, Scamander as the divine embodiment of the river rises up with all his watery might and proceeds to fight Achilles one-on-one. What follows is an epitome from <em>Homeric Questions</em>, 145–146. We know that ancient Greek narratives about hostile encounters between heroes and river gods can traditionally picture the river as taking the shape of a ferocious beast: a prime example is Archilochus F 286-287 (ed. West), where the hero Hēraklēs fights with the river god Akhelōios, who has taken on the shape of a raging bull. We may contrast the treatment of the fight between the hero Achilles and the river god Scamander here in <em>Iliad</em> 21, where the river Scamander does not take the shape of a bull and is not even theriomorphic: rather, the narrative opts for a variant tradition highlighting the elemental aspect of the river, as water personified, struggling with a hero whose ally, as we are about to see, will be the god Hephaistos in his role as fire personified. It has been argued, partly on the authority of the Scholia for I.21.237, that the Archilochean representation is pre-Homeric. But it is enough for now to say that the Archilochean representation stems from a tradition that is independent of Homer. And the Homeric narrative goes out of its way to make an indirect reference to the other tradition. The river god Scamander, in the heat of battle with the hero Achilles, is described at I.21.237 as ‘bellowing like a bull’ (μεμυκὼς ἠύτε ταῦρος). The simile amounts to a conscious acknowledgment of a variant tradition. Finally the river god, after a lengthy struggle, is starting to overwhelm Achilles, and now this main hero of the <em>Iliad</em> finds himself in danger of getting swept away, cut off from all epic memory, in the flooding streams of the enraged Scamander.</p>

# Iliad 21.328–384

<p>In order to save the endangered Achilles, Hērā now induces her son Hephaistos to join the fray and to fight actively against the river god Scamander. Since Hephaistos is god of fire, he is the elemental antithesis of Scamander as god of water, that is, as the local god who embodies the principal river that waters the plain of Troy. So now the fight between fiery hero and streaming god escalates into a cosmic conflict between the elements of fire and water. In the end, then, fire wins over water, but now Hērā induces Hephaistos to stop his fight with Scamander.  </p>

# Iliad 21.385–514

<p>Following up on the combat between Hephaistos and Scamander, other gods now also join in the fight, and, the next thing you know, the cosmic conflict between the elemental forces of fire and water is transformed into a personalized brawl between divine partisans of Trojans and Achaeans. The personalization intensifies to the point of becoming ludicrous, and, once such a point is reached, the whole scene becomes an exquisite exercise in <em>divine burlesque</em>. As Walter Burkert (1960:132) has observed, however, such a comic form is not innovative but archaizing, and there are numerous parallels to be found in the myths and rituals of Near Eastern civilizations; this observation applies also to the divine burlesque that characterizes other narrative sequences Homeric poetry, most notably in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 and in <em>Iliad</em> 1 as well as here in <em>Iliad</em> 21—and in the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>.  </p>

# Odyssey 22

<p>The time has come for Hector to die at the hands of Achilles, and his final moments of life are singularly grim. Achilles shows him no mercy, expressing the most brutal thoughts even before he vengefully finishes off the killer of Patroklos. Hector is forced to know in advance, before he loses consciousness to the death blow from Achilles, that his executioner intends to mutilate his corpse instead of allowing for a proper funeral. And the form of this mutilation is particularly horrific and morally shocking: attaching the body of Hector to the back of his chariot, Achilles will drag it around the walls of Troy for all to see the humiliation of his hated enemy. Is there any hope, then, for transcending such degradation? Only divine intervention, in the story yet to be told, could prevent the disfigurement of a heroic body’s beauty in death. But the story of transcendence must wait. For now, the focus is on the horror and the sorrow of a heroic death as seen through the eyes of Hector’s lamenting widow Andromache.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/30_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_187_x_256.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman. <br/><a>Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>

# Iliad 22.297–305

<p>In this speech, Hector finally understands that he has been delusional all along in thinking that he could possibly defeat Achilles. Athena has actively contributed to the hero’s tragic delusion, and now Hector sees clearly that his death at the hands of Achilles is near. Hector’s delusion is already signaled at I.18.243–314, where the assembly of the Trojans approves of Hector’s plan to stay on the offensive against the Achaeans—even after Achilles has already re-entered the Trojan War. The Master Narrator had commented at I.18.311: this was a bad decision by the assembly, to approve the strategy of Hector, since the goddess Athena had taken away from them their senses, <em>phrenes</em>. If the assembly had been sensible, they would have recognized that Hector’s <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ had failed him, I.18.312. As noted in the comment on I.18.243–314 as also in the earlier comments on I.06.286–311, I.07.017–061, I.08.538–541, I.10.043–052, I.11.200, and I.13.825–829, there is a pattern of personal hostility felt by the goddess Athena toward Hector as a hero who aspires to some of the same qualities that Athena herself exemplifies. Like the goddess, Hector can be seen as an exponent of (1) defensive tactics in the warfare of protecting a citadel from sieges and (2) <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’—two qualities that were tragically taken away from him when he most needed to have them.</p>

<p>Achilles declares to the dying Hector how certain he is about his ghastly intent to expose the corpse of his hated enemy for dogs and birds to devour, I.22.248 (also I.22.354). This certaintly is linked to an even more ghastly uncertainty, expressed as a wish: if only the <em>thūmos</em> and the <em>menos</em> of Achilles, I.22.346, which can be translated here as his ‘heart’ and his ‘mind’ respectively, could bring him to do something that would otherwise be unthinkable, which is, to cut up the body of Hector and eat it raw, I.22.346–347. The use of the two words <em>thūmos</em> and <em>menos</em> here at I.22.346 is relevant to a comparison made earlier by Achilles at I.22.262: Hector is to Achilles as men are to lions. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, Achilles is in fact described as <em>thūmoleōn</em> ‘having the heart of a lion’ at I.07.228. As for the noun <em>menos</em>, which can be translated more literally as ‘mental power’ in contexts where it applies to heroes, it is used at I.20.174 in collocation with <em>thūmos</em> ‘heart’ in describing the impetus of Achilles as an elemental force of nature, comparable to the impetus of an attacking lion, I.20.171.</p>

tags: dragging of Hector, aeike- ‘unseemly’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, mistreating the corpse of Hector

# Iliad 22.395–405

<p>Further degradation awaits the naked corpse of Hector. Here at I.22.395–405, Achilles proceeds to subject the body of Hector to an act that is meant to disfigure it, and the Master Narrator hints at his own moral disapproval by referring to this act as <em>aeikea</em> . . . <em>erga</em> ‘things unseemly’, I.22.395. The generalized idea of ugliness as conveyed by <em>aeikea</em> ‘unseemly’ and other such words in Homeric diction is reciprocal: when you do something ugly to someone, making that someone look ugly, you are thereby making yourself look ugly as well. To be specific, I describe here in detail the ugly things that Achilles will now do to Hector. First, he pierces a hole between the ankle and the heel of Hector’s two feet, and then he threads through these two holes a leather strip that he attaches to the back of his chariot, I.22.396–398. Then he will drag the corpse through the dust and grime of the battleground as he mounts the chariot and drives off at top speed, with Hector in tow. At this horrific moment in the Homeric narrative, feelings of pity are prompted by the narrative itself at I.22.401–403. The Master Narrator prompts his listeners by focusing here on Hector’s hair, once so beautifully groomed but now all disheveled, and then on his head, with a face that was once so charming to look at—but now you expect this beautiful head to be mutilated beyond recognition, once it gets dragged over the harsh and scraping surface of the battleground. The Master Narrator concludes ruefully: the god Zeus himself is allowing all this to happen, I.22.403–404. But what is the god really allowing to happen? So far, there has been a mistreatment and even degradation of Hector’s body, yes. But, at least so far, there has been no disfigurement to be seen. As the Master Narrator takes one last look here at the corpse of Hector, the hero’s head is shrouded in a swirl of dust, I.22.405, and so his face is not visible. The next time the Master Narrator looks at the corpse of Hector, Achilles is displaying the body lying face down in the dust, I.23.024–026, near the stand where the dead body of Patroklos is lying in state, obviously face up. For a preview of this later moment, see the comment on 1.23.1–64. Even there at 1.23.1–64, though, it cannot be known whether the body that Achilles is intending to degrade has in fact already been disfigured. Once again, the face is not visible. At a later point, however, at I.23.184–191, it will become clear that the face and the head and in fact the whole body of Hector cannot be disfigured. The body is saved. In the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, there will be an analysis of this vision of salvation for Hector’s body.  </p>

# Iliad 22.437–475

<p>Although Priam and Hecuba, the parents of Hector, have already seen with horror and sorrow what has happened to him at the hands of Achilles, Andromache does not yet know, I.22.437–439. She is in her private quarters, weaving, I.22.440–441, and she calls out to her handmaidens to prepare a bath for Hector’s expected arrival, I.22.442–444, not knowing what has already happened to him, I.22.445–446. Then and only then does she hear the sound of wailing, I.22.447, and now she starts to feel emotionally and physically undone, as her legs and arms start shaking and her weaving pin drops from her trembling hand, I.22.448. She calls out to her handmaidens, telling them to accompany her to the walls of Troy, so that she may see for herself what is happening, I.22.449–450, and then she starts to express her premonitions about the fate of Hector, which are already becoming a part of the lament that formally gets underway only at I.22.477, lasting all the way to I.22.515. While she expresses her premonitions, she is feeling more and more undone, I.22.450–459. Now her heart is in her throat, I.22.451–452. As she rushes up to the walls of Troy, where she will see what has happened, Andromache is compared to a <em>mainás</em> or ‘maenad’, that is, a frenzied woman possessed by Dionysus, I.22.460. Then, finally, she and her handmaidens get to see the grim scene, I.22.261–265: Hector is dead, and his corpse is being dragged behind the speeding chariot of Achilles. At the ghastly sight, Andromache faints, I.22.466–467, and her elaborate headdress comes undone, falling to the ground, I.22.468–472. The women of her immediate family surround her as she comes out of her swoon, I.22.473–475, and now she begins her lament in earnest, I.22.476–515.  </p>

# Iliad 22.440–441

<p>Like Helen at I.03.125–128, Andromache is shown here at I.22.440–441 in the act of pattern-weaving. And, like Helen, she is not pictured as singing while weaving: rather, she weaves her song into the web that she pattern-weaves. The song that she weaves into her web is pictured as <em>throna</em>, which can mean ‘flower patterns’ or ‘love charms’. It can be argued that both meanings apply in the present context. A similar argument can be made in the case of the epithet <em>poikilo-thronos</em> applied to the goddess Aphrodite in Sappho Song 1.1: this word can mean either ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] flower patterns [that are pattern-woven on your robe]’ or ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] love charms’. See further at MoM 2§76 (also PasP 101n40). Further, at I.22.441, there exists a variant epithet for the web that Andromache weaves: this <em>diplax</em> ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’ is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. And we find the same variation of epithets for the web that Helen weaves at I.03.126: this <em>diplax</em> too is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. Similarly, the antux ‘rim’ that is being made for the Shield of Achilles at I.18.479 is described as triplax ‘threefold’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ at I.18.480. In Eustathius <em>Commentary on the Iliad</em> vol. 4 p. 218 lines 14–17, the commentator draws attention to the morphological parallelism of <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’ with <em>diplax</em> ‘twofold’. So, Eustathius recognizes here a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. See the comment on I.18.479–480. See also the comment on I.09.130, where it is argued that the craft of pattern-weaving by Aeolian women is linked with the power of the craft of Homeric poetry to make contact with the Bronze Age. Finally, in the case of the two textual variants <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ as applied to the web of Helen at I.03.126 and to the web of Andromache at I.22.441, we learn from the scholia for I.03.126 that <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ happened to be the reading preferred by all three major Alexandrian editors of Homer—Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Aristarchus (see also HPC 274nn3, 4).  </p>

# Iliad 22.441

<p>This word <em>en-passein</em> ‘sprinkle’ conveys a metaphor for the process of pattern-weaving. As we learn from the AT scholia for I.22.441, <em>(en-)passein</em> in the Cypriote dialect means <em>poikillein</em> ‘pattern-weave’. Metaphorically, Andromache is sprinkling flowers as love charms into her story by way of pattern-weaving floral patterns into a web that tells her story of love. By extension, the metaphorical world of pattern-weaving applies also to the process of making the kind of poetry that tells about the pattern-weaving of Andromache.  </p>

tags: krēdemnon ‘headdress’, Andromache as maenad, mainás ‘maenad’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 22.460–474

<p>At I.22.460, just as she is about to see with her own eyes the corpse of Hector, the distraught Andromache is already pictured as īsē ‘equal’ to a <em>mainás</em> ‘maenad’ (μαινάδι ἴση), that is, she is being compared to a woman possessed by Dionysus. Earlier, in an analogous context at I.06.389, Andromache is pictured as ‘looking like a woman possessed’ (μαινομένῃ ἐϊκυῖα) when she rushes toward the walls of Troy to see for herself the fate of the Trojans on the battlefield. In the case of the present context, I.22.460, the comparison of Andromache to a maenad is relevant to the undoing of her hair when her elaborate headdress falls from her head at the moment when she goes into a swoon, I.22.468–472. The undoing of a maenad’s hair is a traditional Dionysiac theme, as we see for example in a painting on a vase made in Athens sometime in the decade of 480–470 BCE (Munich, Antikensammlungen no. 2416): this painting shows a maenad transfixed by the gaze of Dionysus, who is looking directly into her eyes, and the maenad’s loose strands of flowing curls of hair are seen cascading down from behind her ears at either side of her head garlanded with the ivy of Dionysus. As we look at the maenad’s hair coming undone, we see a distinctive sign of her starting to lose control to Dionysus, of becoming possessed by Dionysus, of surrendering the self to Dionysus. See also Nagy 2007c:252–253, citing further examples from the visual arts. Andromache looks similarly maenadic when she falls into a swoon, I.22.466–467, while at the same time letting her elaborate headdress fall from her head to the ground, I.22.468–470. What follows is an epitome of further analysis in Nagy 2007c:249–251. In the dramatic context of Andromache’s swoon, I draw attention to the evocative word <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’, I.22.470. It refers to the overall ornamental hair-binding that holds together three separate kinds of ornamental hair-binding that serve to keep Andromache’s hair in place, under control, I.22.469: in this verse, the three separate terms for ornamental hair-bindings are <em>ampux</em> ‘frontlet’, <em>kekruphalos</em> ‘snood’, and <em>anadesmē</em> ‘headband’. The overall hair-binding or ‘headdress’ that keeps it all in place is the <em>krēdemnon</em>, I.22.470. Similarly, Varro (<em>On the Latin language</em> 5.130) speaks of three separate terms for ornamental hair-bindings traditionally used by Roman matrons: lanea ‘woolen ribbon’, reticulum ‘net-cap’ or ‘snood’, and capital ‘headband’. To these three words Varro (7.44) adds a fourth, tutulus (derived from the adjective tutus ‘providing safety’), which seems to be an overall term for the generic headdress worn by brides and Vestal Virgins as well as matrons. When Andromache lets drop from her head her elaborate <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’, I.22.470, thus causing her hair to come completely undone, she is ritually miming her complete loss of control over her own fate as linked with the fate of her husband: we see here a ritually eroticized gesture that expresses her extreme sexual vulnerability as linked with the violent death and degradation of her husband. For Andromache to do violence to her own <em>krēdemnon</em> is to express the anticipated violence of her future sexual humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Pointedly, the goddess Aphrodite herself had given this <em>krēdemnon</em> to Andromache on her wedding day, I.22.470–471 (further analysis by Dué 2006:4, 78). Another example of such ritual miming is the moment in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, verses 40–42, when Demeter tears off her <em>krēdemnon</em> in reacting to the violation of her daughter Persephone by Hādēs. The explicit association of the <em>krēdemnon</em> with Aphrodite reveals its erotic properties. The undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I will call an Aphrodisiac effect. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon</em> is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. This ritual symbolism is part of a “cultural grammar of hair” (Levine 1995:95). Such a “grammar” helps explain why the virginal Nausikaa would not think of going out in public without first putting on her <em>krēdemnon</em>, O.06.100. She won’t leave home without wearing her headdress. Her gesture here is hardly a signal of being married. Clearly, she is unmarried. So, we see that unmarried women as well as married women like Andromache wear the <em>krēdemnon</em> in public. The gesture is simply a signal of propriety. Such a “grammar” is in fact typical of the Mediterranean world in general. A striking point of comparison is the figure of the <em>sotah</em> ‘errant woman’ in Hebrew Bible traditions, who is marked by the ritual dishevelment of her hair (<em>Numbers</em> 5:11–31). In this case, the ‘errant woman’ is a foil for the properly married woman.  </p>

# Iliad 22.476–515/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 2

<p>See also anchor comment at I.06.407–439 on: three laments by Andromache, part 1, and anchor comment at I.24.723–746 on: three laments by Andromache, part 3.</p><p>In the first lament of Andromache for Hector, as we saw in the anchor comment at I.06.407–439, she was already lamenting the death of Hector before he was even dead. As for her second lament, here at I.22.476–515, she sings it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for her third lament, to be featured at I.24.723–746, Andromache will sing it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. The second lament here is in some ways a preview of the third, which as we will see is technically the most formal of Andromache’s three laments. The beginning of Andromache’s second lament is signaled here at I.22.476 by the technical poetic term <em>amblēdēn</em>, an adverb that means ‘making a start [in performance]’ just as the adverb <em>hupoblēdēn</em> at I.01.292 means ‘continuing [in response]’. As Andromache starts to sing her second lament, the word that refers here at I.22.476 to the form of her singing is the verb <em>goân</em> ‘make lament’, corresponding to the noun <em>góos</em> ‘lament’. We have already seen the noun <em>góos</em> at I.18.051, with reference to the lament sung by Thetis for the future death of Achilles. This form of lament, <em>góos</em>, is conventionally sung by female members of the bereaved family, and there will be more to say about this form in the comment on I.24.720–776. For the moment, however, I focus on what happens after Andromache has finished singing her lament at I.22.476–514. Now the Trojan women who are attending her respond to her lament by continuing it with their own lament, in antiphonal performance, at I.22.515: ‘So she [= Andromache] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). The antiphonal refrain here at I.22.515 is signaled by the verb <em>epi–stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’, matching the antiphonal refrain at I.19.301 in response to the lament of Briseis. See the anchor comment at I.19.282–302. So, the second lament of Andromache, as we see it come to a conclusion at I.22.515, is a classic example of a group performance as rounded out by way of an antiphonal refrain. For more on such group performance, see again the anchor comment on I.19.282–302, where it is emphasized that Briseis the Aeolian is featured as a distinctly choral personality, analogous to the personality of Sappho herself in the choral songs attributed to that Aeolian prima donna of a later era.  </p>

# Iliad 22.506–507

<p>Here at I.22.506–507, the meaning of the name of Hector is made explicit. As noted already in the comment on I.06.402–403, the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. This meaning is relevant to the heroic role of the father as <em>protecting a citadel from sieges</em>. This role is expressed by the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Hector, <em>Héktōr</em>, which is an agent noun meaning ‘one who holds [<em>ekhein</em>]’. The translation ‘hold’ here conveys the sense of ‘uphold, protect, guard’: so Hector’s name destines him to be the ‘protector’ of the city of Troy. See the comment on I.05.473–474. The name of Hector is relevant to the fact that Hector’s son is named after him. More than that, Hector’s son is named after the primary function of Hector as signaled by the father’s name, and the rationale for that naming is made explicit at I.22.506–507: as Andromache says to her dead husband here, Astyanax is named Astyanax or ‘king of the city’ precisely because his father was protector of the city. Here is the wording at I.22.507: ‘because you [= <em>Héktōr</em>], all by yourself, protected [<em>eruesthai</em>] for them [= the Trojans] the gates and the walls [of their city]’ (οἶος γάρ σφιν ἔρυσο πύλας καὶ τείχεα μακρά). We see at work here the mythological convention of naming a son after a primary heroic trait of the father, as in the case of the son of Ajax, whose name <em>Eurusakēs</em> means ‘the one with the wide shield [<em>sakos</em>]’; this meaning is made explicit in the wording of Sophocles Ajax 574–578. In the case of Hector’s name as <em>Hék-tōr</em> or ‘protector’, there is a serious danger portended by his function as protector of the citadel of Troy: this heroic function of Hector makes him a rival of the goddess Athena in her own divine function as protector of the same citadel of Troy. See the comment on I.06.286–311, especially with reference to the epithet of Athena as <em>erusi-ptolis</em> ‘protector of the citadel [<em>p(t)olis</em>]’ at I.06.305.  </p>

<p>The funeral that Achilles arranges here for Patroklos in the <em>Iliad</em> is in some ways a preview of the funeral that the Achaeans will arrange for Achilles himself beyond the time-frame of the <em>Iliad</em>. A high point of the funeral in <em>Iliad</em> 23 is a spectacular chariot race arranged by Achilles to honor his dead comrade Patroklos. But an earlier high point is a comparably spectacular cremation of his friend’s body. But this cremation of Patroklos, as a ritual, is far from perfect: it is in fact polluted, and the pollution will make Achilles look bad, at least for the moment. The polluted thoughts of the hero, as evidenced by his dragging the corpse of Hector behind his speeding chariot, will drive him to extremes that will challenge the cosmic order. But the Master Narrator of the <em>Iliad</em> will remedy the pollution, and the remedy will take the form of actually narrating the grim story. In the process of this narration, a great lesson will be learned about life, death, and a hoped-for recovery of life. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/32_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_189_x_383_mm_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Achilles dragging the body of Hector.

# Iliad 23.001–064

<p>While the Trojans are mourning Hector in Troy, I.23.001, Achilles and his fellow Achaeans have all returned to the ships beached at the Hellespont, I.23.001–002, and the hero now calls on the Myrmidons, whose leader he is, to perform special funerary rituals in mourning for Patroklos. The Myrmidon warriors are to mourn Patroklos while driving their chariots around his dead body three times, I.23.007–009, I.23.013–014, after which they are to unharness the chariots and join in a funeral feast arranged by Achilles. The ritual act of mourning while driving, as performed by the Myrmidons, is described overall as a <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, I.23.010, for which Achilles himself is the principal performer, as signaled by the verb <em>arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’, I.23.012. The words of his lead-off lament are quoted at I.23.019–023. In this lament, Achilles addresses the dead Patroklos and repeats to him at I.23.20–23 the two deeds that he had promised at I.18.334–337 to perform before the funeral could take place. First, Achilles had promised to bring back, together with the dead body of Hector, the armor that Hector had stripped from the dead body of Patroklos, and now he reiterates that promise, adding two ghastly details about the dead body of Hector: he has dragged the corpse behind his chariot and intends to feed it to the dogs, I.23.021. And, second, Achilles had also promised to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths on the funeral pyre of Patroklos and then to cremate their bodies together with the body of Patroklos himself, I.23.022–23. After repeating these promises to Patroklos within the wording of his quoted lament, I.23.020–023, Achilles now prepares for the funeral feast—but not before displaying the dead body of Hector, lying face down in the dust, I.23.024–026, next to the stand where the dead body of Patroklos is lying in state. Then, after the Myrmidons unharness their chariots, I.23.026–027, they sit down next to the ship of Achilles in order to partake of the feast, I.23.028, and the slaughter of the sacrificial animals to be eaten at the funeral feast gets underway, I.23.029–034. Nothing is said here about cooking the meat. Instead, the last thing said about this funeral feast of the Myrmidons is that the blood flowing from the mass slaughter of sacrificial animals is streaming all around the corpse of Patroklos, I.23.034. It seems as if the Myrmidons were feasting on raw meat, just as their leader Achilles had expressed the ghastly desire to cut up the mortally wounded Hector and to eat him raw, I.22.346–347. See the comment on I.22.346–348. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Achaeans come to the ship of Achilles and persuade him, with some difficulty, to leave behind the funeral feast of the Myrmidons and to come along with them to the headquarters of Agamemnon, I.23.035–038, where the order is given to prepare for Achilles some hot water for him to wash off all the blood that still covers him, I.23.039–041. Evidently, Agamemnon is preparing for an all-Achaean feast to be attended by Achilles, who is now expected to wash up before the feast begins. And it is only at this moment that we see for the first time that Achilles is still covered in gore. The blood of all the Trojans he has slaughtered on the battlefield is still on him and with him. Already before, Achilles must have been covered in gore when he had hosted the feast for that sub-set of Achaeans who were his own people, the Myrmidons. Back then, neither Achilles nor any of his Myrmidons had washed off the human blood of the killing fields before the shedding of the animal blood at the sacrifice that preceded their funeral feast. But now, for the all-Achaean feast, Achilles is expected to wash up. Not surprisingly, Achilles refuses, declaring at I.23.043–044 that he will remain covered with gore and will refrain from washing off the blood until he performs three sacred tasks. He now names these tasks at I.23.045–046: first, he will cremate Patroklos, I.23.045, and, second, he will make a tumulus that will be a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ for Patroklos, I.23.045, and, third, he will at an earlier point cut off a long lock of his own hair as a sacrifice to be burned on the funeral pyre of his friend, I.23.046. That said, however, Achilles goes on to urge Agamemnon to continue with the plan for an all-Achaean feast, I.23.048—provided that the Achaeans follow up on their nighttime feasting by going out next morning in order to gather firewood for constructing the funeral pyre that will be used for the cremation of Patroklos, I.23.049–053. The Achaeans proceed to indulge in their feasting and then return to their shelters for a night’s sleep, I.23.054–058, while Achilles goes off without having had anything to eat, mourning Patroklos, and he finds a solitary spot on the beach, where he lies down, exhausted, and falls into a deep sleep, I.23.059–064. What will happen next, at I.23.071-076, is the apparition of the spirit of Patroklos. Before commenting on the apparition scene, however, I must pause to note that the narrative has already indicated five salient points of dysfunctionality in the preparations of Achilles for the funeral of Patroklos:</p><p>Point 1. The intent of Achilles to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths as a human sacrifice is understood to be ritually incorrect. See the comment on I.23.163–183. And the fact that he will go through with it and will actually perform the deed will in retrospect be understood to be morally incorrect as well. See the comment on I.23.163–183. In myth, human sacrifice is a pollution, both ritually and morally. And such pollution is typical of what can perhaps best be described as a traditional pattern of dysfunctionality in myth—as opposed to functionality in ritual, where animal sacrifice is understood to be a salvific replacement of human sacrifice. As we see from the myth of Pelops as narrated in Pindar’s <em>Olympian</em> 1, for example, the slaughtering of Pelops is a dysfunctional sacrifice in the heroic world of myth, but it becomes an aetiology for the functional sacrifice of rams in the post-heroic world of ritual as practiced in Olympia during the archaic and Classical periods and beyond (detailed analysis in PH 116–135). In this connection, I offer a working definition of aetiology (background in PH 118, 125–130; 141–142; 386; 395–397; also Nagy 2011a§68):<em> an aetiology focuses on a foundational catastrophe in the mythologized past that explains and thus motivates continuing success in the ritualized present and future</em>.</p><p>Point 2. The dragging of Hector’s corpse by Achilles is likewise understood to be ritually incorrect, and such incorrectness is in this case noted by Homeric poetry, which signals also the moral incorrectness of mistreating a corpse. See the comment on I.23.163–183. Here I invoke a general principle at work in myths about ancient Greek heroes: <em>whenever heroes commit deeds that clearly violate moral codes, such deeds are not condoned by the heroic narrative</em>. See <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5943">H24H 1§52</a>, where I work out an analysis of such a principle, to be summarized in this formulation: <em>the pollution of a hero in myth is relevant to the worship of that hero in ritual</em>. Especially relevant to this formulation, as we will see in later comments, are myths that aetiologize rituals of seasonally recurring athletic competitions: the ritual of competing in an athletic event is thought to purify the original pollution of the hero in myth (analysis in H24H 7a§14).</p><p>Point 3. The intent of Achilles to feed Hector’s corpse to dogs and birds is clearly understood to be a blatant abomination both ritually and morally. In this case, however, Achilles will never get to perform such a horrific deed.</p><p>Point 4. There is something wrong about the funeral feast of the Myrmidons as arranged by Achilles. The blood of sacrifice is not offset here by any mention of cooking the meat to be eaten. </p><p>Point 5. Achilles is ritually incorrect in not purifying himself of human blood before he undertakes the three ritually correct actions of cutting his hair, cremating the body of Patroklos, and entombing his bones.</p><p>All five of these points, as we will see retrospectively in the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, are examples of <em>pollution</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 23.071–076/ anchor comment on: what the psūkhē ‘spirit’ of Patroklos really wants for itself—and for Achilles

<p>On the surface, what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos wants is a proper funeral for the corpse of Patroklos. But what does the <em>psūkhē</em> really want for itself? I ask the question this way in order to highlight a basic fact about the use of the word <em>psūkhē</em> in Homeric diction: as a disembodied conveyor of identity after death, the <em>psūkhē</em> is distinct from the body once the body is no longer alive. In view of this distinction, the answer to the question I just posed is partly evident—but also partly mystical. Here is my formulation of the answer: what the <em>psūkhē</em> really wants for itself is to be reunited with the body, and such a reunion must be achieved by way of a proper funeral. The part that is mystical about this formulation is the fact that the very idea of a proper funeral is a ritual construct that fits the mythological construct of the <em>psūkhē</em>. The ritual must be done right, and then the myth of the <em>psūkhē</em> will turn out to be right. So, it is imperative for Achilles to get things right in preparing a proper funeral for Patroklos. And how will Achilles make sure that the funeral of Patroklos is a proper funeral? Most important, there must be a ritually correct entombment, I.23.071, and a vital part of this entombment will be the actual cremation of the corpse, I.23.070–071 / I.23.076. Before cremation of the corpse, the <em>psūkhē</em> as a ‘spirit’ that used to belong to the body will be haunting the world of the living, but, after cremation, there will be no more haunting, I.23.075–076. So, what will happen to the <em>psūkhē</em> after cremation of the body? It is often assumed by readers of these verses at I.23.071-076 that the <em>psūkhē</em> as ‘spirit’, once the body is cremated, will now simply join the other <em>psūkhai</em> or ‘spirits’ who are already in Hādēs, and that will be the end of that. But the original Greek wording does not say that. In my opinion, what it really says gets misunderstood. What follows is a reinterpretation of I.23.071–076, divided into ten points:</p><p>Point 1. I start with evidence from Homeric poetry about the underworld known as Hādēs. I argue that Hādēs is a zone of transition for the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ as it journeys from the Far West to the Far East. In this mystical zone, <em>psūkhai</em> can get lost along the underworld pathways leading from west to east, and then they will wander around, but they can also find the way, and, from the very start, the right way can be achieved by way of cremation. There will be much more to say about Hādēs in comments on the <em>Odyssey</em>. For now, however, it is enough to say at least this much more on the basis of the internal evidence of I.23.071–076: without a proper cremation and entombment, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos will not achieve safe passage through Hādēs. I make a special point here of saying <em>through</em> Hādēs and not <em>to</em> Hādēs. As I will argue further in comments on the <em>Odyssey</em>, Homeric poetry treats Hādēs as something that is <em>transitional</em>, not <em>eschatological</em>. In the Iliadic passage that is now being analyzed, I.23.071–076, even the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ is something that is ultimately transitional in its own right.</p><p>Point 2. At I.23.073, it is said that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos is not allowed by the other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ to join them ‘on-the-other-side-of [<em>huper</em>] the river [<em>potamos</em>]’ (ὑπὲρ ποταμοῖο), and that is why it is then said at I.23.074 that the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is left to wander all over the realm of Hādēs. The point is, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is already in Hādēs, wandering around, and thus his <em>psūkhē</em> is not being excluded from Hādēs by the other <em>psūkhai</em>. Rather, as I argue here, the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is being excluded from joining other <em>psūkhai</em> who are no longer wandering around in Hādēs.</p><p>Point 3. And why are these other <em>psūkhai</em> no longer wandering around? It is because they have already found the way to get to the other side of the <em>potamos</em> ‘river’, I.23.073. And what is ‘the river’ here? In terms of Homeric poetry, this river must be the world-enclircling fresh-water stream named Ōkeanos, which as we saw in the comment on I.07.421–423 is a boundary delimiting light from darkness, wakefulness from sleep, life from death. The sun rises from the Ōkeanos at sunrise in the Far East, as we see at I.07.421–423, just as it sets into it at sunset in the Far West, as we see at I.08.485–486. And the movement of the sun both into and out from the Ōkeanos in the Far West and in the Far East respectively is envisioned as a cosmic model for an alternation between darkness and light, between sleep and awakening, between death and revival from death. </p><p>Point 4. This model is most relevant to what is meant when the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos says at I.23.073 that the other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ do not allow his spirit to join them ‘on-the-other-side-of [<em>huper</em>] the river [<em>potamos</em>]’ (ὑπὲρ ποταμοῖο). In this case, I argue, the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos is imagined as separating the dead from the living in the Far East, where the sun rises, not in the Far West, where the sun sets.</p><p>Point 5. Correspondingly, the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hādēs mentioned at I.23.071 are situated in the Far East, where the sun rises, not only in the Far West, where the sun sets. In support of this interpretation, I note that the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hādēs at I.23.071 can be seen as a by-form of the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hēlios the Sun, mentioned at I.24.012. See also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on: Gates of Hādēs. (Further analysis in GMP 225–226.)</p><p>Point 6. If, then, the Gates of Hādēs are the Gates of the Sun, then I can make more sense of what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’of Patroklos is saying at I.23.071, where this spirit expresses its desire to pass through the Gates of Hādēs. I argue that the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos here is seeking passage through the gates of Hādēs that are situated in the Far East, where the sun rises, not through the gates that are situated in the Far West, where the son sets. See also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on: Gates of Hādēs.</p><p>Point 7. Similarly, the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos seeks to cross the world-encircling cosmic river in the Far East, not in the Far West. Whereas the other side of the river in the Far West is the zone of Hādēs from the standpoint of the living, the other side of the same river in the Far East is a mystical place beyond the zone of Hādēs—from the standpoint of the dead who are still wandering around in Hādēs but who seek a renewal of life. As the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos says at I.23.074, his spirit is still wandering around in the zone of Hādēs. And that is because his body has not yet received the ritual of cremation, which as we will now see will lead to a recovery of life after death.</p><p>Point 8. The scenario that I have put together here is based not only on the internal evidence of the wording at I.23.071–076 and elsewhere in Homeric poetry. It is based also on the comparative evidence of cognate Indic traditions centering on rituals of cremation as correlated with myths about a recovery of life after death. There is a detailed survey in the essay “Patroklos, Concepts of Afterlife, and the Indic Triple Fire,” GMP 85–121 (the essentials can be found at pp. 87, 115–121). In terms of Indic ritual and myth, cremation leads to a reunion: once the cremation takes place, the spirit without body and the body without spirit can now be reunited, and, this way, the dead can now be revived after death. Further, such a revival results in the reunion of the revived dead with the already revived <em>pítṛ</em>-s or ‘ancestors’. It is most relevant to note here that the Indic word <em>pítṛ</em>- ‘ancestor’ is cognate with the Greek word <em>Patro</em>- in the name <em>Patrokléēs</em>, which means ‘he who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors [<em>pateres</em>]’: thus the role of Patroklos in instructing Achilles about the vital importance of cremation is in and of itself a deeply traditional theme. </p><p>Point 9. On the basis of both the internal and the comparative evidence that I have assembled so far, my formulation about the the ritual of cremation as visualized in myth can now be extended. In this extended formulation, I start with a scenario that reconstructs the initial phase of what happens to the <em>psūkhē</em> after the body is successfully cremated:</p><p>After a successful cremation, the <em>psūkhē</em> will cease wandering around in  Hādēs and will now find its way out. The <em>psūkhē</em> will cross the world- encircling river in the Far East and pass through the Gates of Hādēs,  which are the Gates of the Sun, <em>just as the sun passes through these same  gates when it rises at sunrise</em>.  </p><p>Point 10. I now continue with a scenario that reconstructs the next phase of what happens to the <em>psūkhē</em> after the body is successfully cremated. In this case, I find no internal evidence in Homeric poetry, and so I turn to the comparative evidence of Vedic poetry in Indic traditions, which show at least the broad outlines. From here on, since I now rely primarily on the Indic comparanda, I will no longer say <em>psūkhē</em> but simply ‘spirit’, which can serve as an adequate translation for both the Greek word and the corresponding Indic word, <em>mánas</em>-. This Indic word refers to the breath of life that leaves the body at death and is destined to be mystically reintegrated with the body after cremation. That said, I resume the scenario: </p><p>After finding its way out of the lower world, the spirit follows the path of  the sun and joins the rising sun at sunrise, ascending into the skies and  seeking to be reunited there with the body. Meanwhile, the body has  already been vaporized by way of cremation, and its fumes ascend into  the skies, seeking to be reunited there with the spirit.  </p><p>Such a prospective reunion of spirit and body is the secret of immortalization after death, <em>and the key to that secret is the ritual of cremation</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 23.093–23.098

<p>Achilles responds to the apparition in his dream, I.23.094–096, declaring to the spirit of Patroklos that he intends to do exactly what this spirit has instructed him to do. But the hero’s declaration here is interwoven with a question that he asks of the spirit: why do you appear to me and instruct me to do things that I already intended to do? This interwoven question at I.23.094–096 is most curious, since it is patently unjustifiable. I argue that the things intended by Achilles fail in more than one way to match the things intended by the psūkhē of Patroklos. There are two main reasons for making this argument:</p><blockquote><p>First, Achilles intends to do more than the two things that Patroklos instructs him to do. As we see at I.23.045–046, Achilles intends not only to cremate Patroklos and to entomb him but also to cut off a long lock of his own hair as a sacrifice to be burned on the funeral pyre of his friend. And he intends to do even more than that. As we see in the lament of Achilles where he addressed the dead Patroklos, he repeats to him there at I.23.20–23 the two deeds that he had promised at I.18.334–337 to perform before the funeral could take place: first, Achilles had promised to bring back, together with the dead body of Hector, the armor that Hector had stripped from the dead body of Patroklos, and, second, he had also promised to slaughter twelve captive Trojan youths on the funeral pyre of Patroklos and then to cremate their bodies together with the body of Patroklos himself. And there is even more: as we see at I.22.326–330, at I.22.354, and at I.22.248 (together with I.22.354), Achilles intends to expose the body of Hector to be devoured by dogs and birds, after having degraded the corpse by dragging it behind his chariot. But the fact is, the spirit of Patroklos had not spoken to Achilles about any of these other things.</p><p>And here is the second reason for arguing that the interwoven question of Achilles at I.23.094–096 is not justifiable: the fact is, Achilles had never spoken about any intent to have himself entombed together with Patroklos when the time comes for his own funeral. The idea of such a double entombment came from the psūkhē of Patroklos.</p></blockquote>

# Iliad 23.099–107

<p>While Achilles is still dreaming, he asks Patroklos to embrace him, I.23.097–098. With these words, Achilles finishes his speech to the spirit of Patroklos. Now the Master Narrator can take over, and he narrates how Achilles, having finished speaking to Patroklos, then reaches out to embrace him, I.23.099. But no contact can be made, since Patroklos is merely a <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’, I.23.100, which recedes like a wisp of smoke and disappears beneath the earth, I.23.100–101. Now Achilles is jolted out of sleep, and he reflects ruefully on what he just experienced, I.23.101–106: this <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’—he now refers to Patroklos this way at I.23.104 and I.23.106—is just an <em>eidōlon</em> ‘likeness’ of Patroklos and is devoid of any <em>phrenes</em> ‘senses’, and yet he looked just like the real Patroklos, I.23.107. The surprise expressed by Achilles here in reacting to the realistic appearance of Patroklos recalls an earlier point in the narrative: when the <em>psūkhē</em> of Patroklos is first sighted at I.23.065, already in that first moment of its apparition, it is pictured as life-size, I.23.066—so, it is not a miniature version of the self. In other traditions, as reflected in vase-paintings dated mostly to the late sixth century BCE, the size of such a <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ is in fact miniaturized. See the comment on I.24.014–121.  </p>

Though Meriones as a <em>therapōn</em> of Idomeneus is a ritual substitute for that king of all the Cretans, this recessive member of the pair does not die for that dominant member. We see here a radical contrast with Patroklos, who does in fact die for Achilles. Meriones stays alive, destined to become a dominant hero in his own right. And a dress-rehearsal, as it were, for this status of eventual dominance is the role of Meriones as a competing chariot driver in the chariot race of <em>Iliad</em> 23.

In the first reference here, at I.23.125–126, it is already made clear that the place for constructing the funeral pyre that will cremate the corpse of Patroklos will be the same place where the tomb for Patroklos will also be constructed—and that this tomb will ultimately enclose not only the bones of Patroklos but also the bones of Achilles. This place is described as a lofty <em>aktē</em> ‘promontory’, I.23.125, and <em>ērion</em> is the word for the ‘tomb’ that will be prepared after the cremation, I.23.126. And it is specified that this tomb is intended for entombing not only Patroklos but also Achilles, when the time comes for his own funeral, I.23.126. So, we now see that Achilles has heeded the instructions of Patroklos to make a tomb for the two heroes to share. And, as we will see when we reach the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257, this tomb will be incomplete until Achilles is entombed together with Patroklos. Ultimately, this tomb will belong primarily to Achilles.  </p>

tags: post-heroic age, making the funeral pyre, Achilles cuts his hair, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 23.138–153

<p>Now the making of the funeral pyre may begin. And, in preparation, Achilles will cut his own golden-blond hair, I.23.141, placing into the lifeless hands of Patroklos the long lock that he shears off, I.23.152–153. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 12§26a.) The long unshorn hair of Achilles had ostentatiously signaled his pre-adult status. Once his hair is cut short, he can become an adult. In this Homeric scene, as we see Achilles standing on the heights of the promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that encloses his own body, he wistfully looks out over the seas of the outer Hellespont, fixing his gaze toward the far west, in the direction of his native land of Thessaly, and longing for the river Sperkheios that flows through that distant land: it was to the waters of that river, which he will never live to see again, that he had hoped to sacrifice his long hair after he came of age and was ready to cut it, I.23.142-153. But now Achilles cuts his long hair prematurely and unseasonally as he stands there on the promontory, I.23.142. Meanwhile, the Myrmidons led by Achilles will anticipate his example, likewise cutting their hair, I.23.135-136. (At H24H 14§26a, I need to correct what I say about I.23.135–136: it is only the Myrmidons, not the Achaeans <em>en masse</em>, who cut their hair here.) This ritual gesture of cutting the hair in mourning for Patroklos will later be extended after Achilles himself is killed: what then happens at his own funeral is that all the Achaeans, not only the Myrmidons, will join in the same gesture: as we learn at O.24.046, all the Danaoi=Achaeans will cut their hair for Achilles. But now, at I.23.138–153, Achilles himself will show the way by cutting his own hair, thus prefiguring what all the Achaeans will do <em>en masse</em> at his own funeral. <em>Do as I do</em>. Achilles shows the way to mourn him later by now cutting his own hair in mourning for his other self Patroklos. Moreover, this same ritual gesture of cutting the hair in response to the death of Achilles becomes an aetiology for explaining why it is that Greek men of the post-heroic age customarily wear their hair short, not long—except for such notable counter-examples as the Spartans. In a work of Philostratus, <em>On Heroes</em> (51.13), we read the following succinct formulation of an aetiology for this generalized Greek custom: ‘no longer could they [= the Achaeans] consider it a beautiful thing to grow their hair long, in the time after Achilles’ (οὐδὲ κομᾶν ἔτι μετὰ τὸν Ἀχιλλέα καλὸν ἡγούμενοι). In the wording of this aetiology, it is as if the death of Achilles were the single reason that explains why adult men of the post-heroic age no longer wore their hair long. It is as if all the ‘sons of the Achaeans’ were now ready to shift from pre-adult to adult status—once Achilles was dead and buried. The term ‘sons of the Achaeans’—as the Achaean warriors are conventionally described in the <em>Iliad</em> (I.01.162 and so on)—implies a pre-adult status for all those ‘boys’ who fought in the Trojan War. But now those fighting ‘boys’ of the heroic age have reached a post-heroic maturity that inaugurates a post-heroic age.  </p>

# Iliad 23.140

<p>Here and some fifty lines later (23.193) are the only two occurrences in the <em>Iliad</em> of the ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε (“then he/she thought of other things”) formula, which occurs with much greater frequency in the <em>Odyssey</em>. In that poem, the formula functions as a marker of a more or less significant discontinuity: a change of scene or a turn of the plot in a substantially new direction (see <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). In this instance, there is no such discontinuity, at least in terms of the scene or the forward movement of the action. Instead of a sudden departure in a new direction, we find a ‘zooming in’ on the goal of the action, from the Myrmidons as they march in Patroklos’ funeral procession to Achilles standing at the pyre. The discontinuity consists rather in the transition to a ritual act of special significance: Achilles’ dedication of the lock of hair that Peleus had vowed would be offered to the river Sperkheios on Achilles’ return to Phthia. The subsequent occurrence of the formula likewise marks the shift to an especially significant ritual act, namely, the lighting of Patroklos’ funeral pyre. The formulaic marker of discontinuity thus serves to highlight the most critical ritual moments in the otherwise continuous narrative of Patroklos’ funeral. Comparison with the usage of the formula in the <em>Odyssey</em> suggests further layers of possible meaning. At <em>Odyssey</em> 23.242, a variant of the formula occurs in a context in which, again, there is no immediately apparent discontinuity. And, again, this occurrence is followed by another a short while later (23.344). These two instances enclose what is arguably the most significant moment in the <em>Odyssey</em>: the reunion of Odysseus and Penelope, which Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus identified as the poem’s τέλος (see <em>Odyssey </em>23.242). One might similarly view the ritual act enclosed by the <em>Iliad</em>’s two occurrences of the formula as the τέλος of that poem, for, by shearing the lock of hair he had saved for Sperkheios, Achilles ritually formalizes his destiny to die at Troy. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, furthermore, the ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε formula, which is used most often with Athena as subject, serves as an index of narrative control: it highlights the fact that Athena prompts and guides the action (see <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). In <em>Iliad</em> 23, Achilles emerges as a comparable director of the action. Not only does he dictate the ritual procedures of Patroklos’ funeral; during the subsequent games he directs contests that restage, in various ways, many of the poem’s principal themes. Finally, it is tempting to draw some connection between the fact that, in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the formula is restricted to female subjects (Athena, Helen, Nausikaa, Penelope) and the fact that, in the <em>Iliad</em>, it refers exclusively to Achilles’ involvement in funerary ritual. As a mourner, Achilles participates in a sphere of action that is typically dominated by women (see Alexiou 2002 and Dué 2006: ch. 1). The application to Achilles of a formula that is otherwise associated with female actors may serve to highlight his assumption of a very different social role than he has hitherto occupied.  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bibliographical References</p><p>Alexiou, M. 2002. <em>The Ritual Lament in Greek Tradition.</em> Rev. ed.

# Iliad 23.154–162

<p>So far, the preparations for cremation, with all the preliminary rituals, have been open to all the Achaeans. But now Achilles urges Agamemnon to send them away to their dinners. So, attendance at the cremation will be restricted. Only the kind of person who was a <em>kēdeos</em> ‘mourning-relation’ for Patroklos may attend the event, I.23.160. Other than these men, only the <em>agoi</em> ‘leaders’ of the Achaeans are also allowed to attend, I.23.160. But there is something odd about the exclusion of the Achaean masses from participating in the cremation. This exclusion, as we are about to see, can be connected with five signs indicating that the ritual of cremation for Patroklos was about to be somehow compromised, even polluted.  </p>

# Iliad 23.163–183

<p>Now the cremation proceeds to the finish. The <em>kēdemones</em> or ‘mourning-relations’ who stayed behind may now complete the task of making a mighty funeral pyre, I.23.163–164, and then they place the corpse of Patroklos on top of the pyre, I.23.165. What follows next is a spectacular array of sacrificial offerings that are also placed on the pyre, to be burned together with Patroklos, I.166–178. The offerings include sacrificial animals that are ritually slaughtered before being placed on the pyre: included are sheep and cattle at I.23.166, horses at I.23.171–172, and dogs at I.23.173–174. And then, the last and most important of the sacrificial offerings are the twelve Trojan youths that Achilles had already promised to slaughter as a human sacrifice: Achilles will now personally cut their throats and leave their bodies to be cremated alongside Patroklos, I.23.175–178. Then, to finish off the ritual of cremation, Achilles addresses Patroklos, picturing him in the realm of Hādēs, I.23.179. Achilles boasts again, as he had done before, that he has done everything that he has promised to do, I.23.180—but the only one of those things that he now mentions here specifically is the sacrifice of the Trojan youths, I.23.181–182. There is something very wrong here, and the Master Narrator knows it. Already at I.23.176, where he highlights the moment when the Trojan youths are killed before being cremated, the Master Narrator says about Achilles: ‘and he had bad intentions in in his mind’ (κακὰ δὲ φρεσὶ μήδετο ἔργα). By intending things that look bad for his victims, he is making himself look bad. See also the comment on I.22.395–405, with reference to I.22.395. So, what makes Achilles look bad here? For an answer, I repeat what I already said at Point 1 in the comment on 1.23.01–064: the killing of the Trojan youths as a form of human sacrifice is in retrospect understood to be morally wrong. In myth, human sacrifice is a pollution. And such pollution is an instance of dysfunctionality in myth as opposed to functionality in ritual, where animal sacrifice is understood to be a salvific replacement of human sacrifice. And the idea that something is polluted in the thinking of Achilles when he slaughters the youths is linked to something else in his train of thought as he goes on to say one more thing about this killing: at least the bodies of the youths were devoured by the fire of cremation, I.23.183. But then he adds in the same train of thought: by contrast, the body of Hector will be devoured by dogs, I.23.183. So, Achilles expresses here once again a ghastly intention that he has expressed so many times before. But, this time, the expression becomes the final moment in the ritual of cremation for Patroklos. And to bring the whole ritual of cremation to such a conclusion is I think a sign of pollution. Here I find it relevant to epitomize what I already said at Points 2 and 3 in the comment on 1.23.01–064 about the mistreatment of Hector’s corpse by Achilles: <em>both the dragging of the corpse and the intent to feed it to dogs and birds are signs of pollution</em>.  </p>

# Iliad 23.184–191

<p>As we will now see, the gods are well aware of the ongoing pollution, and they counteract it by way of purification, which takes the form of preserving the body of Hector from the mistreatment intended by Achilles. Right after Achilles declares once again at I.23.183 that he will expose his enemy’s body as prey to be devoured by dogs, the Master Narrator firmly contradicts him at I.23.184: no, the dogs will not be devouring the body of Hector. And why? Because the gods will not allow it. Aphrodite herself is keeping the hellish hounds away from the corpse, I.23.185–186. And the goddess is applying to Hector’s skin a salve that is <em>ambrosio</em>- ‘immortalizing’, thus keeping it intact and saving the beautiful flesh from any disfigurement—no matter how many times Achilles will drag the corpse behind his speeding chariot, I.23.186–187. (On the word <em>ambroto</em>-/<em>ambrosio</em>- in the sense of ‘immortalizing’, not ‘immortal’, see the relevant comment on I.16.670.) So, the goddess of sexual beauty has kept the naked body of Hector beautiful to the point of becoming sexually attractive: Hector is now the definitive <em>beau mort</em>, the beautiful corpse, since his dead body has been made beautiful by way of a beautiful death, <em>une belle mort</em>. (See <em>Homer the Classic</em>, 4§266, with bibliography on the French terminology; see also the relevant comment on I.17.050–060.) For the first time here at I.23.184–191, we see that the body of Hector was never even disfigured—despite the horrific visions of disfigurement that the Master Narrator allowed to be imagined at I.22.395–405 and even later at 1.23.1–64. (See especially the comment on I.22.395–405.) Now, all those darkly horrific visions of ugliness recede in the beautiful light of divine intervention. Not only does Aphrodite apply her immortalizing salve to Hector’s flesh, I.23.186–187, but Apollo does even more, enveloping the hero’s entire body in a divine glow that will shield it from all decay and pollution, I.23.188–191. And by now we can see that the action of the gods in perfectly preserving the dead body of Hector is an act of perfect purification that counteracts the self-pollution of Achilles in mistreating the corpse. We have already seen that the polluted thoughts of Achilles had even compromised the ritual of cremation for Patroklos. But now we will see that the saving of Hector’s body by the gods will lead to an overall purification that will in the course of time counteract not only the specific pollution of mistreating the corpse of Hector but also the overall pollution that has compromised the ritual of cremating the corpse of Patroklos. And the gods will accomplish this overall purification by saving Hector’s body as a ritually idealized corpse that is worthy of a ritually ideal cremation—which will actually take place in <em>Iliad</em> 24. Even before we reach the narration of that ideal cremation in <em>Iliad</em> 24, eight points need to be made already now about the picturing of Hector’s body as a ritually idealized corpse here at I.23.184–191:</p><blockquote><p>Point 1. The etymology of the noun <em>sōma</em>, conventionally translated as ‘body’, is relevant to the ritual idealization of Hector’s corpse in <em>Iliad</em> 23. To make this argument, I start by returning here to the basic idea that Hector’s corpse is ideal because it was saved for a ritually ideal cremation—and thus saved from the horrors of exposition to dogs and birds.</p><p>Point 2. That said, I propose that this idea of something that is saved matches the etymology of <em>sōma</em>, which I explain as an action-noun derived from a verb that survives as <em>sōzein</em> in classical Greek prose, meaning ‘save’. This relatively late form of the verb, <em>sōzein</em>, is already attested in Homeric poetry (as at O.05.490: σώζων), though the dominant use of the same verb in this poetry preserves an uncontracted (and thus older) shape of the root, which is <em>sa(w)o</em>- (as at I.24.035: σαῶσαι). The contracted (and thus newer) shape of the root, which is <em>sō</em>-, occurs normally in the “weak” metrical positions of the Homeric hexameter (that is, in the second long of a sequence long-long, which derives from a sequence long-short-short), but there is already an attestation of this same shape in a “strong” metrical position (that is, in the first long of a sequence long-long or in the long of a sequence long-short-short): in this case, the root is attested in the adjective <em>sōs</em>, meaning ‘safe or ‘saved’, at I.22.332 (σῶς ἔσσεσθ’). Similarly, the root of the noun <em>sōma</em> is attested in a “strong” metrical position throughout its occurrences in Homeric hexameter. In terms of my proposal, then, <em>sōma</em> was an action-noun derived from a contracted form of its verb-root: so, from <em>sō</em>-, not from <em>sao</em>-. As an action-noun derived from a verb meaning ‘save’, it would have originally meant ‘saving’ —and then later became concretized to mean ‘the thing saved’. Here is a semantic parallel: the action-noun <em>sperma</em>, derived from the verb-root <em>sper</em>- meaning ‘sow’, originally meant ‘sowing’—and then later become concretized to mean ‘a thing that is sown’, that is, ‘seed’. An ideal corpse, then, in terms of the etymology I propose, is a thing that is saved.</p><p>Point 3. In Homeric diction, this word <em>sōma</em> as applied to heroes refers to a ‘body’ that is already dead but needs to be saved from mistreatment or from dangers in general. The clearest example is at I.22.342: Hector, mortally wounded by Achilles and already on the verge of death, is making a final plea to Achilles, asking him to show mercy not to the dying Hector but to the dead Hector that he will be after he has died, and this dead Hector is called here the <em>sōma</em> of Hector. To say it another way, Achilles is asked to show mercy to the <em>sōma</em> of Hector after Hector is already dead and his body is already a corpse. That is why Hector is pleading for his <em>sōma</em> to be returned to Troy, where the Trojans can arrange for it to have the proper ritual of cremation, I.22.342–343. Such an arrangement is anticipated already at I.07.079–080.</p><p>Point 4. By making this plea, Hector is at the same time pleading for his body not to be exposed as prey for dogs to devour, I.22.339: ‘don’t let the dogs at the ships of the Achaeans ravage me’ (μή με ἔα παρὰ νηυσὶ κύνας καταδάψαι Ἀχαιῶν). Here the future corpse of Hector is starkly equated with the present self of Hector. He is not even saying here, ‘don't let the dogs devour my body’, but instead he says more simply, ‘don't let the dogs devour me’. This idea of the dead body as the self has already been highlighted in the comment at I.01.003–005.</p><p>Point 5. As for the outcome of Hector’s plea here, I have already analyzed in the comment on I.22.346–348 the savage response of Achilles, who declares his certaintly that, yes, he will expose Hector’s corpse as prey for dogs and birds to devour, I.22.248 (also I.22.354). But I concentrate here only on the wording of the original plea that provoked the response. In terms of this wording, the <em>sōma</em> is something that needs to be saved for cremation and thus saved from harm. The <em>sōma</em> must be saved. It needs salvation. And, ideally, the <em>sōma</em> is in fact saved. That is the ritualized ideal that we see reflected in the etymology, to be interpreted as ‘the thing that is saved’.</p><p>Point 6. I find it relevant to add, however, that Homeric diction can also turn the meaning of <em>sōma</em> upside down: in two contexts, I.03.023 and I.18.161, <em>sōma</em> refers to a carcass that is being devoured by a ravenous lion that holds on to it and won’t let go. For wild animals, then, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved for devouring. For humans, by contrast, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved from being devoured by wild animals—and thus saved for cremation.</p><p>Point 7. In Homeric poetry, the saving of the corpse for cremation translates into a salvation of the self by way of cremation. Hector’s cremation in the heroic age, as we will see it described in <em>Iliad</em> 24, will become a model for all cremations in the post-heroic age. And this cremation of Hector in <em>Iliad</em> 24 will undo the pollutions that had compromised the cremation of Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23. These pollutions will be purified by way of narrating the cremation of Hector, which will be done right and which will therefore be free of pollution. In the future, as the cremation of Hector demonstrates, there will be no more polluting of cremation as a ritual, as there had been at the cremation of Patroklos. No longer will there by any human sacrifices. No longer will the mistreatment of corpses be condoned. The polluting of rituals like cremation in the heroic age of myth will be superseded by the purifying of these same rituals in the post-heroic age of ritual, which is the era of the Homeric present, when rituals can be done right.</p><p>Point 8. The rituals of the post-heroic age include not only the aristocratic and vastly expensive practice of cremation. They include also the wildly popular medium of epic performance as exemplified by the Homeric poetry of the <em>Iliad</em>. If epic performance is ritualized, which is what I argue, then the actual narration of all the events that supposedly took place in the heroic age is a ritual in and of itself. And, as a ritual, epic performance can be a form of purification in its own right. Whatever events are narrated in Homeric poetry, the performance of these events, good or bad, is purified simply by way of being narrated. It is in this context that we can view the five salient points of dysfunctionality in the preparations of Achilles for the funeral of Patroklos, as listed in the comment on 1.23.01–064. In retrospect, all five of these points show examples of pollution. And all five of these examples can ultimately be counteracted by the purifying power of narration in epic performance. Epic narration can purify pollution.</p></blockquote>

<p>See also anchor comment at I.23.125–126 on: tomb of Achilles, part 1, and anchor comment at O.24.076–084 on: tomb of Achilles, part 3.</p><p>The tomb of Patroklos, called <em>tumbos</em> here at I.I.23.245, will also become the tomb of Achilles when his time comes to die. It is to be built on a small scale until Achilles is entombed there as well, I.23.245–246. But then, with the entombment of Achilles together with Patroklos, the size of the tomb will become spectacular in both height and width, I.23.246–247. So, this tomb will be incomplete until Achilles is entombed together with Patroklos—at which point it becomes truly the tomb of Achilles. So, instead of saying here that the tomb of Patroklos will also become the tomb of Achilles, it would be more accurate to say that the tomb of Patroklos will simply belong to Achilles. The spirit of Patroklos, when he appeared to Achilles and instructed him to construct a tomb for the two of them, was really pointing the way for Achilles to have a tomb of his own. There now follows at I.23.248 a pointed reference to the Achaeans of the future who will be sailing past the promontory on top of which the tomb is located and marveling at the sight of the structure, which is called a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb at I.23.257. This visualization, as we will see in the anchor comment at O.24.076–084, makes it all the more clear that the tomb of Patroklos will in fact turn into the tomb of Achilles. </p>

# Iliad 23.245-248...256-257/ anchor comment on: tomb of Achilles, part 2

<p>The tomb of Patroklos, called <em>tumbos</em> here at I.I.23.245, will also become the tomb of Achilles when his time comes to die. It is to be built on a small scale until Achilles is entombed there as well, I.23.245–246. But then, with the entombment of Achilles together with Patroklos, the size of the tomb will become spectacular in both height and width, I.23.246–247. So, this tomb will be incomplete until Achilles is entombed together with Patroklos—at which point it becomes truly the tomb of Achilles. So, instead of saying here that the tomb of Patroklos will also become the tomb of Achilles, it would be more accurate to say that the tomb of Patroklos will simply belong to Achilles. The spirit of Patroklos, when he appeared to Achilles and instructed him to construct a tomb for the two of them, was really pointing the way for Achilles to have a tomb of his own. There now follows at I.23.248 a pointed reference to the Achaeans of the future who will be sailing past the promontory on top of which the tomb is located and marveling at the sight of the structure, which is called a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb at I.23.257. This visualization, as we will see in the anchor comment at O.24.076–084, makes it all the more clear that the tomb of Patroklos will in fact turn into the tomb of Achilles.

tags: agōn ‘competition’, A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad

# Iliad 23.257–258

<p>An <em>agōn</em>, as here at I.23.258, is literally a ‘coming together’ for competition; so, by extension, the word comes to mean ‘competition’. For more on the meaning and the etymology, see <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours </em>(<em>H24H</em>), 21§1. Here at I.23.257–258 is where the so-called Funeral Games for Patroklos will commence. And they will end at I.24.001. See the comment on that verse. The ritual practice of athletic competition as a compensation for death is amply attested in Greek tradtions: see <em>H24H</em> 8a §§1–14. Here at I.23.258 the <em>agōn</em> can now begin to compensate for the death of Patroklos.</p>

And it hasn’t rotted away from the rains. |329 There are two white rocks propped against either side of it. |330 There it is, standing at a point where two roadways meet, and it has a smooth track on both sides of it for driving a chariot. |331 It is either the tomb [<em>sēma</em>] of some mortal who died a long time ago |332 or was a turning point [<em>nussa</em>] in the times of earlier men. |333 Now swift-footed radiant Achilles has set it up as a turning point [<em>terma</em> plural]. |334 Get as close to it as you can when you drive your chariot horses toward it, |335 and keep leaning toward one side as you stand on the platform of your well-built chariot, |336 leaning to the left as you drive your horses. Your right-side horse |337 you must goad, calling out to it, and give that horse some slack as you hold its reins, |338 while you make your left-side horse get as close as possible [to the turning point], |339 so that the hub will seem to be almost grazing the post |340 - the hub of your well-made chariot wheel. But be careful not to touch the stone [of the turning point], |341 or else you will get your horses hurt badly and break your chariot in pieces. |342 That would make other people happy, but for you it would be a shame, |343 yes it would. So, near and dear [<em>philos</em>] as you are to me, you must be sound in your thinking and be careful. </p><p>(Epitomized from H24H 7§§3–6.) I concentrate here on the use of the word <em>sēma</em> in two verses, I.23.326 and I.23.331, concerning the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor to his son, the hero Antilokhos, about the <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ of an unnamed hero. I divide my analysis into four parts:</p><p>Part 1.</p><p>The two verses come from a passage where Nestor gives instructions to Antilokhos about the driving skills required for a charioteer to make a left turn around a landmark. As we will now learn from the context, this landmark is meant to be used as a turning point in the course of a chariot race that is being planned as the culminating athletic event of the Funeral Games for Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23. In the words of Nestor, this landmark is either a <em>sēma</em>, ‘tomb’, of an unnamed hero of the distant past, I.23.331, or it was once upon a time a ‘turning point’, a <em>nussa</em>, I.23.332, used for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. As I will argue, the master narrative of the <em>Iliad</em> shows that this <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ is to be understood as the tomb of Patroklos himself, which he will share with Achilles once Achilles too is dead. To understand this is to understand the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor.</p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The <em>sēma</em> that is the ‘tomb’ of the unnamed hero at I.23.331 is also a ‘sign’ of that hero’s cult, as signaled by the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ that is conveyed by the speaker at I.23.326. That is what I once argued in an essay entitled “<em>Sēma</em> and <em>Noēsis</em>: The Hero’s Tomb and the ‘Reading’ of Symbols in Homer and Hesiod” (<em>GM</em> 202-222). As I pointed out in that essay, we know from evidence external to Homeric poetry that the tomb of a cult hero could be used as the actual turning point of a chariot race: in the historical period, starting with the adoption of chariot racing in the athletic program of the Olympics (this adoption has been dated at around 680 BCE), the turning-point of chariot-races could be conceptualized as the tomb of a hero, whose restless spirit was capable of “spooking” the horses at the most dangerous moment of the chariot-race, the left turn around the turning point. (GMP 215-216, with reference to Pausanias 6.20.15-19).</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>According to the wording of Nestor, however, there seem at first to be two different interpretations of the landmark that he is showing to Antilokhos: what is being visualized is either a tomb of a cult hero from the distant past or it is a turning point for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. The landmark is an ambivalent sign. At least, it seems ambivalent, short range, on the basis of Nestor’s wording in this passage. Long range, however, on the basis of the overall plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, this wording will lead to a fusion of interpretations. And the sign that seemed at first to be ambivalent will become clear. Long range, the tomb of the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes the same landmark as the turning point of a chariot race from the distant past. That is because the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes a named hero from the immediate present of the <em>Iliad</em>. That hero is Patroklos, and he died just now, as it were, in <em>Iliad</em> 16. </p><p>Part 4</p><p>But Patroklos dies not only in the present time of the <em>Iliad</em>. He also did die a long time ago, from the standpoint of later generations who are listening to the story of the <em>Iliad</em>. So, the storytelling of the Iliad makes it possible for the athletic event of a chariot race from the distant past to become the same thing as the athletic event of a chariot race that is being held right now, in the same immediate present time of the story, in <em>Iliad</em> 23. And, as I argue, this race is intended to honor Patroklos as a once and future cult hero. See also the comment on O.11.119–137.  </p>

<p>The <em>Iliad</em> ends with the funeral of Hector, not of Achilles. And it is Hector, not Achilles, who is lamented at the end. But it is Achilles who makes it all happen, since he has transcended his rage and has shown mercy to an old father. The tears of Priam had made Achilles think of his own old father, of his own ancestors—and of Patroklos, who embodied the glories of the ancestors. Achilles was looking bad at the beginning of <em>Iliad </em>23 and even at the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 24, but he looks very good by the time <em>Iliad</em> 24 comes to a close.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/34_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_184_x_346_mm_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Mourners lament as Hector’s corpse is laid out in preparation for the funeral that closes <em>Iliad</em> Rhapsody 24.

tags: A Sampling of Comments on the Iliad, sēma ‘tomb’, mistreating the corpse of Hector, dragging of Hector

# Iliad 24.14–18

<p>In these four verses, there is a compressed narration of what Achilles does over and over again during a sleepless night. He harnesses his chariot and drives it around the tomb of Patroklos three times while dragging the corpse of Hector. The tomb is called the <em>sēma</em> at I.24.16. The Master Narrator states here that this tomb belongs to Patroklos, as if the ultimate ownership of the tomb by Achilles were still in doubt. But the statement is justified, since the size of the tomb has not yet been adjusted to fit the prestige of Achilles himself: on this point see the anchor comment at I.23.245–248 and 256–257. Achilles drives his chariot around the tomb three times, then rests in his <em>klisiē</em> ‘shelter’, I.24.017, and then drives around three times again, and so on. Each time he rests inside his shelter, he leaves the body outside, lying prone in the dust, face down, I.24.017–018. The body has been shown before in this same degraded state: see the comment on I.22.395–405. Once again here, it is left to the imagination whether the body is horribly disfigured. It cannot be known, however, whether the body that Achilles is intending to degrade has in fact already been disfigured. Once again, the face is not visible. But, once again, it will become clear that the face and the head and in fact the whole body of Hector cannot be disfigured. This time, the clarification happens immediately, in the verses that follow.  </p>

# Iliad 24.018–022

<p>Once again, divine intervention prevents the disfigurement of Hector’s body. The intervention starts starts midline at I.24.018, and the narrative of the intervention extends through I.24.018: the god Apollo will not allow any <em>aeikeiē</em> ‘unseemliness’ to happen to the body of Hector, I.24.019. Apollo focuses here on Hector’s <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’, I.24.019, worrying that the hero’s skin will be grotesquely scraped away by the harsh surface over which it is being dragged behind the speeding chariot of Achilles, I.24.021. This time, the protective covering that is granted by the gods is not an enveloping glow, as it was at I.23.188–191 (see the anchor comment at I.23.184–191), but rather a mystical <em>aigis</em> ‘skin-shield’, I.24.020. Then, at I.24.022, by way of ring-composition, the thinking returns to the horrors of mutilation by way of ‘disfiguring’ the body, as expressed here by the verb <em>aeikizein</em>. But the disfigurement is canceled. Once again, the body is saved. See again the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, where the vision of salvation for Hector’s body is fully analyzed.  </p>

# Iliad 24.29–30

<p>In the story about the Judgment of Paris, as we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em>, Proclus 102.14–19 (ed. Allen 1912), Paris=Alexandros has to choose from among three goddesses, Hērā, Athena, and Aphrodite, <em>Cypria</em>/Proclus 102.14–19. Which of the three is supreme? Paris chooses Aphrodite, who rewards him by arranging his love affair with Helen. The story of the Judgment of Paris is recapitulated, in a most compressed form, here at I.24.025–030. And the story is told in terms of a contrast between positive and negative words. The fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽). As noted in the comment on I.03.100, the verbs <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ express both the social and the poetic significance of praise and blame respectively.  </p>

# Iliad 24.032–054

<p>In the speech of Apollo here, Ι.24.032–054, there is a compressed retelling of unseemly deeds committed by Achilles. At Ι.24.050–052, the god condemns especially the violence of Achilles, and he points to the hero’s dragging the corpse of Hector, I.24.050–052, around the <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ of Patroklos, I.24.051. In this context of condemning the hero’s violence, the god compares him to a ravenous lion at I.24.041–043. The wild beast is driven by its wild instincts, described here as its <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’ and its <em>thūmos</em> ‘heart’, I.24.042, as it lunges to devour the sheep that it is attacking, and here the word <em>dais</em> ‘portion (of meat)’ is used in referring to the meat of its prey, I.24.43. There is an irony here in the use of the word <em>dais</em>, since this word is closely connected to stories about Achilles: see the comments on I.07.319–322, I.19.044, I.19.179–180. The picturing of a ravenous lion that is lunging for the meat of its prey is comparable to the use of the word <em>sōma</em> at I.03.023 and I.18.161: what is pictured in both these contexts is a carcass that is being devoured by a ravenous lion that holds on to it and won’t let go. Here is what I said about such contexts in Point 6 of the anchor comment for I.23.184–191: for wild animals, the <em>sōma</em> is something that must be saved for devouring, while for humans the sōma is something that must be saved from being devoured by wild animals. See also the comment on I.22.346–348, where I analyze other comparisons of Achilles to lions.  </p>

It is the story about the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the mortal and immortal parents-to-be of Achilles. As we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria </em>in Proclus 102.13–19 (ed. Allen 1912), there was <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at the <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ celebrating the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. It was the Will of Zeus that <em>Eris</em> ‘Strife’ personified would bring about a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ among the gods that would ultimately result in the Trojan War (Proclus 102.14/15 on <em>Eris</em>/<em>neikos</em>).

# Iliad 24.509–512

<p>While Priam mourns for his own son Hector, Achilles alternates in mourning for his own father Priam and for Patroklos as his own other self. By mourning for both his father and for Patroklos, Achilles shows the way—showing how to mourn for ancestors. <em>Do as I do</em>. Relevant is what the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Patroklos means: ‘he who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors [<em>pateres</em>]’. See the comments on I.01.345, I.06.209, I.09.185–191. Such a meaning signals the basic fact that one’s father is one’s most immediate ancestor. The <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of Achilles is thus linked, for all time to come, with a poetic glory that originates from the ancestors.  </p>

# Iliad 24.720–776/ anchor comment on: laments at Hector's funeral

<p>The laments for Hector at his funeral can be divided into two main parts, the second of which can be subdivided into three sub-parts. The first main part is at I.24.720–722, where professional <em>aoidoi</em> ‘singers’ who are men, I.24.720, perform <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721; as they perform, the word that refers to their performance is <em>thrēneîn</em> ‘make lament’, I.24.722, which is a verb derived from the noun <em>thrēnos</em> ‘lament’. Following up on the laments performed by the professional singers are laments performed by the <em>gunaikes</em> ‘women’ of Troy, I.24.722. These women, as women singers, are of course non-professionals, and their role as singers is subordinated to the role of the professional singers, as we see from the use of the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’ at I.24.722 in referring to their performance. This act of wailing-in-response is treated here as an antiphonal complement to the singing of the professional singers, who are described as <em>ex-arkhoi</em> ‘lead singers’ of the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’ that they sing, I.24.721. By now we have reached the end of the narrative about the first main part of the laments performed at the funeral of Hector. Now the narrative about the second part of the laments can begin, and this part, as noted already, can be subdivided into three sub-parts. The Master Narrator now quotes, as it were, three laments, to be performed by Andromache at I.24.725–745, by Hecuba at I.24.748–759, and by Helen at I.24.762–775. But the two main parts in this overall scheme are not kept separate here, since the same women who sang at I.24.722 their responses to the laments sung by men who were lead singers will now perform responses to the three women who will now be singing their own laments, and these three will now be singing as lead singers in their own right, as expressed by the verb <em>arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ in the case of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 / I.24.761. These three singing women are not professionals, but nevertheless they hold positions of great social status, since they all belong to Hector’s immediate family: as family members, they sing a form of lament that qualifies as a <em>góos</em>, not as a <em>thrēnos</em>. This word <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ is applied to the singing of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 (also at I.24.760) / I. 24.761. Of these three, the most important performer of lament here is Andromache, since she gets to cradle the head of Hector from behind while she sings her song of lament over his corpse, I.24.724. The special importance of Andromache is also signaled by the fact that the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’, which had signaled at I.24.722 the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721, that were sung by the professional lead singers, is also used at I.24.746 to signal the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, I.24.723, that is sung by Andromache as the non-professional lead singer. The general response at I.24.746 by the women of Troy to the lament of Andromache is an intensification of the more specific response at I.22.515 by the women who attended her when she previously sang her second lament, though the wording is exactly the same at I.24.746 as at I.22.515: ‘So she [= Andromache] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). An even more general response, however, occurs at I.24.776, where not just the women of Troy but the entire <em>dēmos</em> or ‘populace’ of the city joins the antiphonal singing, as signaled here by the verb <em>epi-stenein</em> ‘wail in response’: ‘So she [= Helen] spoke, and the vast populace [<em>dēmos</em>] wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δ’ ἔστενε δῆμος ἀπείρων). Now the whole community is lamenting in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ as re-started at I.24.761 by Helen as the last of the three women who sing here as lead singers.  </p>

# Iliad 24.723–746/ anchor comment on: three laments by Andromache, part 3

<p>In the first of the three laments performed by Andromache, as quoted by the Master Narrator at I.06.407–439, she is already lamenting the death of Hector before he is even dead. As for the second lament, as quoted at I.22.476–515, she sings it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for her third lament, here at I.24.723–746, she sings it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. As Andromache starts her song of lament at I.24.723, the verb <em>arkhein</em> in the sense of ‘lead off [in performing]’ signals that she is leading off as a lead singer, and the song that she sings is called here a <em>góos</em> ‘lament’. Then, as Andromache finishes her lead song at I.24.746, the women of Troy sing an antiphonal refrain as signaled by the verb <em>epi-stenakhizesthai </em>‘wail in response’. See also anchor comment at I.06.407–439 on: three laments by Andromache, part 1; and anchor comment at I.22.476–515 on: three laments by Andromache, part 2.  </p>

# Iliad 24.785–804

<p>The corpse of Hector is placed on top of the funeral pyre, and then the pyre is lit, Ι.24.786–787. The next morning, the fires of the cremation are extinguished and the bones of Hector are gathered, Ι.24.792–795, to be placed into a <em>larnax</em> ‘repository’, Ι.24.795. A tumulus is heaped over the remains, I.24.799, and the tumulus itself is called a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’, I.24.799/801. What we see here in <em>Iliad</em> 24, in the conclusion to the entire epic narrative, is a perfect description of a perfect entombment after a perfect cremation—to be contrasted with the ritually flawed cremation of Patroklos as described in <em>Iliad</em> 23. Here I find it relevant to cite the archaeological background on the practice of cremation in the Mycenaean era. I quote a brief summary in Nagy 2015.07.22 §31:</p><p>When I last considered the practices of cremation in a Mycenaean context [in 1990: GMP 85–86], those practices were barely attested archaeologically. But now, with the discovery of nine cremations at the site of Chánia, some three kilometers southwest of the acropolis of Mycenae [Palaiologou 2013], the picture has changed. I note with special interest the splendor of the tumulus that contained these cremations, dated to the 12th century BCE [Palaiologou 2013.274]. The archeologist of record describes as “monumental” the stone tumulus with its circular “cyclopean” enclosure, and she notes that the ritual moment of the actual cremation, which required vast pilings of firewood, must have been “spectacular” [Palaiologou 2013.251]. This splendid tumulus, situated on a plain contiguous with Argos, was most visible to all: “it served as a landmark for the control of the commercial route to Argos and the cultivated area simultaneously” [Palaiologou 2013:275]. By this time, in the 12th century BCE, the glory days of Mycenae and of its Achaean realm were becoming evanescent, but the vitality of Mycenaean culture was still a forceful presence, acknowledged and respected by the local population.</p>

# Epilogue 1: Hector as the ultimate beau mort

<p>See also anchor comment at I.23.184–194.</p><p>[epitome from HC 4§267]</p><p>The focus of the <em>Iliad</em> on Hector as the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> is evident at the conclusion of this epic. The <em>Iliad</em> as we know it ends with the funeral of Hector, not of Achilles. It is Hector, not Achilles, who is lamented at the end. Even the very last word of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it is a signature for Hector: it is his ornamental epithet <em>hippodamos</em>, the ‘horse-tamer’, I.24.804 (Sacks 1987). So, the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> evolved in such a way as to highlight Hector as the primary point of interest in the poetics of terror and pity. To be contrasted is an alternative epic like the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, where the focus at the end is evidently on Achilles as the primary <em>beau mort</em>. Pindar’s reference to the dead Achilles in <em>Isthmian</em> 8 (56-60) alludes to this alternative epic tradition (PH 204–206). In the <em>Iliad</em>, the doomed figure of Hector has been substituted for the equally doomed figure of Achilles, who is the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> of epic. Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> prefigures Achilles as that ultimate <em>beau mort</em>. </p>

# Epilogue 2: Hector as an ideal for Athenians

<p>[epitome from HC 4§268]</p><p>This foregrounding of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> as we know it is a matter of politics as well as esthetics. The beautiful death of Hector, his <em>belle mort</em>, is for Athenians an expression of their empire. See the comment on I.15.494–499, where I made an epitome from HC 4§268. In what follows, I repeat the relevant parts of that epitome. The Athenian statesman Lycurgus says it best when he refers to the willingness of Athenian citizens to die in war not only for their own <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ but also for all of Hellas as a <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 104). Lycurgus invokes as his prime example the <em>belle mort</em> of the Athenian citizen-warriors who fought at Marathon and who thereby won for Hellas a freedom from terror, an <em>adeia</em> ‘security’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (104). The Athenian statesman is making this reference to the imperial interests of Athens in the context of actually quoting the words of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em>, who says that he is willing to die for his fatherland in order to protect it against the Achaeans (Lycurgus <em>Against</em> <em>Leokrates</em> 103 lines 4-9). These heroic words of Hector correspond to I.15.494–499, and Lycurgus quotes them in the larger Athenian festival of the context of saying that the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, as performed at the quadrennial Athenian festival of the Panathenaia, are the ancestral heritage of the Athenians and the primary source of their education as citizen-warriors (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 102). In this invocation of Homeric poetry as the most sublime expression of the Athenian empire, the statesman is quoting the words of a Trojan, not the words of an Achaean. It is the <em>belle</em> <em>mort</em> of Hector that motivates the Athenians to live up to the heroic legacy they learn from Homer. </p>

# Iliad 19.404-418

<p>Xanthos, immortal horse of Achilles, is telling the hero a prophecy: Achilles will be killed by an unnamed hero who will be helped by an unnamed god. Before the fate of Achilles is fully revealed, however, <em>Erīnues</em> ‘Furies’ block the divine horse from revealing any further details about the death of Achilles. Correspondingly, the Master Narrator of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> is blocking—for now—the revelation of any further details.</p>

# Iliad 1

<p>  </p><p>The comments I offered in Classical Inquiries 2016-2017 on <em>Iliad</em> Rhapsody 1 through Rhapsody 24, starting here with Rhapsody 1, were based mostly on details that derive from seven books that I indicate in the Bibliography by way of these abbreviations: BA, GMP, H24H, HC, HPC, HQ, HR, MoM, PasP, PH. Each one of these books has its own <em>index locorum</em>. My colleague Anita Nikkanen, an Associate Editor for the online project <em>A Homer commentary in progress</em>, tracked the sequences of Homeric verses as listed in the indices for six of these books and then summarized my comments on those verses. Following up on her meticulous work, I am in the process of converting her summaries into a form of commentary that is being incorporated into <em>AHCIP</em>. My comments on the <em>Iliad</em> as I presented them in <em>Classical Inquiries</em> 2016-2017 are merely samplings of the content that I hope to contribute to the overall commentary, to which a number of other colleagues are also contributing their own comments. That said, I now proceed to offer a sampling of comments on Rhapsody 1. At this point, my comments about this beginning of beginnings need no further introduction of their own. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The_Rage_of_Achilles_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo-2.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“The Rage of Achilles,” by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, 1757, [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
