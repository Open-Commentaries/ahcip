# Homeric Hymn to Apollo

<p>As we see from the testimony of the fifth-century historian Thucydides (3.104.6), the chorus of the Delian Maidens who are described in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> are to be viewed as prototypes for the choruses that actually performed at the Delia, that is, at the festival of Apollo at Delos in historical times. At the Delia, as Thucydides (3.104.6) observes, city-states participated in the ritual of ‘sending’ (<em>anagein</em>) their local choruses to perform there as part of a ‘sacrifice’, conveyed by the word <em>hiera</em>, ‘sacrificial offerings’. In fact, a traditional word for a festival like the Delia was <em>thusiā</em>, which literally means ‘sacrifice’. There is a most relevant attestation of both these words, <em>hiera</em> or ‘sacrificial offerings’ and <em>thusiā</em> or ‘sacrifice, festival’, in an account concerning the celebration of the Delia at Delos in the glory days of the Athenian empire. This account, Plutarch’s <em>Life of Nikias </em>3.5-7, gives a full-blown description of the magnificent spectacle of choral performances at the Delia:</p><p>Nikias is remembered for his ambitious accomplishments with regard to Delos - accomplishments most spectacular in all their splendor and most worthy of the gods in all their magnificence. Here is an example. The choral groups [<em>khoroi</em>] that cities used to send [to Delos] for the performances of songs sacred to the god (Apollo) used to sail in [to the harbor of Delos] in a haphazard fashion, and the crowds that would gather to greet the ship used to start right away to call on the performers to start singing their song. There was no coordination, since the performers were still in the process of disembarking in a rushed and disorganized way, and they were still putting on their garlands and changing into their costumes. But when he [= Nikias] was in charge of the sacred voyage [<em>theōriā</em>] [to Delos], he first took a side trip to the island of Rheneia, bringing with him the choral group [<em>khoros</em>] and the sacrificial offerings [<em>hiereia</em>] and all the rest of the equipment. And he brought with him a bridge that had been made in advance, back in Athens, to fit the present occasion, and this bridge was most splendidly adorned with golden fixtures, with dyed colors, with garlands, with tapestries. Overnight, he took this bridge and spanned with it the strait between Rheneia and Delos - not a very great distance. |3.6 Then, come daylight, he led the procession in honor of the god and brought across the bridge to their destination the performers of the choral group [<em>khoros</em>], who were outfitted most magnificently and were all along performing their song. |3.7 Then, after the sacrifice [<em>thusiā</em>] and after the competition [<em>agōn</em>] and after the feasting, he set up as a dedication to the god the [famous] bronze palm tree.</p><p>Plutarch <em>Life of Nikias</em> 3.5-7</p><p>μνημονεύεται δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ περὶ Δῆλον ὡς λαμπρὰ καὶ θεοπρεπῆ φιλοτιμήματα. τῶν γὰρ χορῶν, οὓς αἱ πόλεις ἔπεμπον ᾀσομένους τῷ θεῷ, προσπλεόντων μὲν ὡς ἔτυχεν, εὐθὺς δ’ ὄχλου πρὸς τὴν ναῦν ἀπαντῶντος ᾄδειν κελευομένων κατ’ οὐδένα κόσμον, ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ σπουδῆς ἀσυντάκτως ἀποβαινόντων ἅμα καὶ στεφανουμένων καὶ μεταμφιεννυμένων, ἐκεῖνος ὅτε τὴν θεωρίαν ἦγεν, αὐτὸς μὲν εἰς Ῥήνειαν ἀπέβη, τὸν χορὸν ἔχων καὶ τὰ ἱερεῖα καὶ τὴν ἄλλην παρασκευήν, ζεῦγμα δὲ πεποιημένον Ἀθήνησι πρὸς τὰ μέτρα καὶ κεκοσμημένον ἐκπρεπῶς χρυσώσεσι καὶ βαφαῖς καὶ στεφάνοις καὶ αὐλαίαις κομίζων, διὰ νυκτὸς ἐγεφύρωσε τὸν μεταξὺ Ῥηνείας καὶ Δήλου πόρον, οὐκ ὄντα μέγαν· |3.6 εἶθ’ ἅμ’ ἡμέρᾳ τήν τε πομπὴν τῷ θεῷ καὶ τὸν χορὸν ἄγων κεκοσμημένον πολυτελῶς καὶ ᾄδοντα διὰ τῆς γεφύρας ἀπεβίβαζε. |3.7 μετὰ δὲ τὴν θυσίαν καὶ τὸν ἀγῶνα καὶ τὰς ἑστιάσεις τόν τε φοίνικα τὸν χαλκοῦν ἔστησεν ἀνάθημα τῷ θεῷ.</p>

# Homeric Hymn to Apollo 156-178

<p>The hymning of Apollo at the cult center of his sacred island of Delos is idealized, as I have argued, in the first part of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> (the second part honors the god as worshipped at the rival cult center of Delphi). But the actual hymning of the god takes on other forms in the historical present. Whereas Apollo is hymned by an idealized chorus of Delian Maidens in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> (156-178), there is evidence for real choruses that hymned the god at his Delian festival in the historical period of the fifth century BCE and thereafter. </p>

# Homeric Hymn to Apollo 390

<p>There are three passages where the word <em>therapeuein</em> seems at first sight to have nothing to do with a meaning such as ‘heal, cure’. I start with <em>Odyssey</em> 13.265. Here the first-person narrator of a “Cretan tale” says that he was unwilling to ‘be a <em>therapōn</em>’, <em>therapeuein</em>, for the over-king of Crete, Idomeneus, preferring instead to be the leader of his own comrades. The next passage is at <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 390, where the god Apollo selects a group of Cretans to serve as his attendants, <em>therapeuein</em>, at his shrine in Delphi. Finally, the third passage is at Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 135, where the prototypical humans who represent the second generation of humankind are said to be unwilling to serve as attendants, <em>therapeuein</em>, to the gods; and, as we read in the next verse, these sacrilegious early humans are likewise unwilling to perform sacrifices to the gods at their altars (<em>Works and Days</em> 136).</p>
