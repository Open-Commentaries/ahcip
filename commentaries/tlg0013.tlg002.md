<p>In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, we see this description of Dēmophōn as an infant hero: </p><p>|233 And so it came to pass that the splendid son of bright-minded Keleos, |234 Dēmophōn, who was born to the one with the beautiful waist, Metaneira, |235 was nourished in the palace, and he grew up [<em>aexeto</em>] equal [<em>īsos</em>] to a superhuman force [<em>daimōn</em>], |236 not eating grain, not sucking from the breast. But Demeter |237 used to anoint him with ambrosia, as if he had been born of the goddess, |238 and she would breathe down her sweet breath on him as she held him to her bosom. |239 At nights she would conceal him within the power source [<em>menos</em>] of fire, as if he were a smoldering log, |240 and his dear [<em>philoi</em>] parents were kept unaware.

These descriptions, replete with vivid imagery centering on the wilting of plants, are typical of cult heroes who are destined to die and then receive as compensation some form of immortalization after death.</p>

# Homeric Hymn to Demeter 239-250

<p>In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, the athletic competition of the <em>Ballētus </em>is overtly described as an act of compensation, recurring at the right season into all eternity, and this competition is understood to be an eternal compensation for a primal pollution caused by human error. That pollution was the unintended death of an infant hero named Dēmophōn. The queen of Eleusis, mother of this infant hero, had unintentionally ruined the plan of the goddess Demeter to make Dēmophōn exempt from death. That moment happens when the queen interrupts Demeter in the sacred act of dipping the infant Dēmophōn into the fire of the household fireplace in order to galvanize this infant into a state of immortality (<em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 239-250). Here I quote the passage that tells about the immediate aftermath, where the goddess angrily condemns the error of the queen and announces that the infant hero Dēmophōn will now be subject to death, like all other mortals. As we are about to see, however, the dooming of the infant to death comes with a compensation: </p><p>Hour 8 Text C </p><p>|259 I [= Demeter] swear by the implacable water of the Styx, the witness of oaths that gods make, as I say this: |260 immortal and ageless for all days |261 would I have made your dear [<em>philos</em>] little boy, and I would have given him honor [<em>tīmē</em>] that is unwilting [<em>a-phthi-tos</em>]. |262 But now there is no way for him to avoid death and doom. |263 Still, he will have an honor [<em>tīmē</em>] that is unwilting [<em>a-phthi-tos</em>], for all time, because on my knees |264 he had once sat and slept in my arms. |265 At the right season [<em>hōrā</em>], every year, |266 the sons of the Eleusinians will have a war, a terrible battle among each other. |267 They will do so for all days to come.</p><p><em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267</p><p>I highlight here at verse 265 the noun <em>hōrā</em> (plural <em>hōrai</em>), ‘season, seasonality, the right time, the perfect time’. As we see from the context that I just quoted here in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, this noun <em>hōrā</em> marks the seasonal recurrence of rituals honoring cult heroes.</p>

# Homeric Hymn to Demeter 259-267

<p>So, just as the Golden Generation is a positive image of a cult hero, the corresponding Silver Generation is a negative image. In this narrative about the Silver Generation (<em>Works and Days</em> 127-142), the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em> shows the dark side of cult heroes: the heroes of the Silver Generation refuse to ‘care for’ the gods, <em>therapeuein</em> (135), and they likewise refuse to perform sacrifices to the gods (136). But, despite such impious behavior, which is equated with not giving <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, to the gods (138), these heroes of the Silver Generation are said to receive <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, from humans after they die, just as the heroes of the Golden Generation receive honor (142). And, taken from the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (259-267), this word <em>tīmē</em> can refer to the ‘honor’ that cult heroes receive in the rituals of hero cult after they die, as in the case of the <em>tīmē</em> received by the cult hero Demophon after he dies (261, 263). As we can see in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (268), where the goddess refers to herself as <em>tīmāokhos</em>, ‘receiver of honor’ [<em>tīmē</em>], the gods receive tīmē just as cult heroes receive tīmē, but of course they do not have to die to receive it as heroes have to die. And the heroes of the Silver Generation do have to die, as we have just seen in the text I quoted. So, once again, I apply the formula: <strong>god-hero antagonism in myth corresponds to god-hero symbiosis in ritual</strong>.</p>

<p>The athletic event of the mock battle or <em>Ballētus</em>, as featured in the Eleusinian Games, was understood to be a form of eternal compensation for the primal death of the cult hero Dēmophōn, as we saw from the wording I quoted in the comment <em>Homeric Hymn to Demete</em>r 239-250. And there are historical parallels, including the Nemean and the Isthmian Games, which were seasonally recurring festivals featuring athletic competitions intended as eternal compensation for the prototypical deaths of two other infant heroes, Arkhemoros and Melikertes respectively. </p>

<p>What makes the athletic events of <em>Iliad</em> 23 appear to be different from the “real” athletic events of the historical period is this: whatever is happening in <em>Iliad</em> 23 appears to happen only once, whereas “real” athletic events are seasonally recurrent.

<p>Such myths can be understood in terms of initiation from boyhood into manhood, for the purpose of preparing men for warfare. Such a ritualized purpose is evident also in such institutions as the seasonally recurring mock battle known as the <em>Ballētus</em> at the Eleusinian Games, which I considered in the Homeric <em>Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267. Another, more famous, example is the mock battle of Spartan boys in a sacralized space known as the <em>Platanistās</em>, ‘Grove of the Plane Trees’ (Pausanias 3.11.2, 3.14.8-9, at 3.20.8). On the basis of such rituals, we may infer that the institutionalized practices of athletics and warfare were originally viewed as parts of one single ritual continuum. </p>

# Homeric Hymn to Demeter 259-267

<p>Here we see the same syntactical construction that we saw in the compressed retelling of the aetiological myth that motivated the foundation of the athletic competition ‘in honor of’ the infant hero Dēmophōn. I repeat here the wording as we found it in Hesychius: Βαλλητύς· ἑορτὴ Ἀθήνησιν, ἐπὶ Δημοφῶντι τῷ Κελεοῦ ἀγομένη, ‘<em>Ballētus</em> is a festival in Athens, celebrated in honor of [<em>epi</em>] Dēmophōn son of Keleos’. Once again, I have translated the preposition <em>epi</em> (ἐπί) here in combination with the name of Dēmophōn in the dative case as ‘in honor of Dēmophōn’. But this translation is inadequate, and it would be more accurate to word it this way: ‘in compensation for [the death of] Dēmophōn’. After all, as I noted in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267, the athletic competition of the <em>Ballētus </em>is overtly described as an act of compensation, recurring at the right season into all eternity, and this competition is understood to be an eternal compensation for one single all-important fact: that the hero Dēmophōn must die. </p>

# Homeric Hymn to Demeter 261

<p>As I note in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267, the goddess Demeter foretells the <em>tīmē</em> <em>aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’ (verses 261, 263), of a seasonally-recurring athletic event that the hero Dēmophōn will receive as a compensation for his death (verses 265-267). Similarly in the <em>Iliad</em>, the goddess Thetis foretells the <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’ (9.413), that the hero Achilles will receive as a compensation for his own death:</p><p>|410 My mother Thetis, goddess with silver steps, tells me that |411 I carry the burden of two different fated ways [<em>kēres</em>] leading to the final moment [<em>telos</em>] of death. |412 If I stay here and fight at the walls of the city of the Trojans, |413 then my safe homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] will be destroyed for me, but I will have a glory [<em>kleos</em>] that is unwilting [<em>aphthiton</em>]. |414 Whereas if I go back home, returning to the dear land of my forefathers, |415 then it is my glory [<em>kleos</em>], genuine [<em>esthlon</em>] as it is, that will be destroyed for me, but my life force [<em>aiōn</em>] will then |416 last me a long time, and the final moment [<em>telos</em>] of death will not be swift in catching up with me. </p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9.410-416</p><p>The parallelisms in the wording that we see in these two passages highlight the parallelisms between Dēmophōn and Achilles as heroes who are linked with festivals. Just as the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, of the hero Dēmophōn takes the form of a seasonally recurring athletic event that is <em>aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Hymn to Demeter</em> 261, 263), because it will last forever, eternally recycled at the festival of the Eleusinian Games, so also the <em>kleos</em>, ‘glory’, of the hero Achilles takes the form of a seasonally recurring poetic event that is <em>aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Iliad</em> 9.413), because it too will last forever, eternally recycled in the context of a festival like the Panathenaia. </p>

<p>In this comment I need to concentrate on the actual form of immortalization that Dēmophōn and Achilles will be granted by the divine order. In the case of Dēmophōn, as we see in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 261 and 263, he will be granted <em>tīmē aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’, by virtue of becoming the cult hero who presides over the prime athletic event of the Eleusinian Games; and, in the case of Achilles (<em>Iliad</em> 9.413), he will be granted <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’, by virtue of becoming the cult hero who presides over the prime poetic event of the Panathenaia. </p>

<p>So, I maintain that the <em>kleos</em> of Homeric poetry is in its own right a seasonally recurring ritual event, since both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> were performed at the festival of the Panathenaia in Athens. And, as we have seen, the poetic event of a competition in performing the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> at the Panathenaia was parallel to the athletic event of a competition of <em>apobatai</em> at the same festival. This athletic event, as we have also seen, is comparable to the mock battle of the <em>Ballētus</em>, which was the primary athletic event of the Eleusinian Games and which qualifies as <em>tīmē aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’, in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (261, 263), while the primary poetic event of performing epic at the Panathenaia qualifies as <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’, in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> (9.413). </p>

<p>The death of the infant hero will be compensated by seasonally recurring rituals of athletic re-enactment, as expressed by the word <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’ (verse 263), which refers here to the honor conferred upon cult heroes in the rituals of hero cult. In this case, the rituals take the form of an athletic competition that overtly simulates warfare. And these rituals will have to recur seasonally, year after year, for a notional eternity. Such a seasonal recurrence is indicated by the word <em>hōrā</em> at verse 265 of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>. And now we see why the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, that the prototypical hero receives in compensation for his death is described as <em>a-phthi-tos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (verse 263), that is, lasting forever. Another example of such a seasonally recurring ritual is a mock battle of boys competing within a sacralized space known as the <em>Platanistās</em>, ‘Grove of the Plane Trees’, in Sparta: this ritual is described by Pausanias (3.11.2, 3.14.8-9), who notes that the boys made sacrifice to the hero Achilles before they started their mock battle (3.20.8). </p>

<p>At the core of the narratives about <em>Hēraklēs</em> is the meaning of <em>hērōs</em>, ‘hero’, as a cognate of <em>Hērā</em>, the goddess of seasonality and equilibrium, and of <em>hōrā</em>, a noun that actually means ‘seasonality’ in the context of designating hero cult, as in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 265. The unseasonality of the <em>hērōs</em> in mortal life leads to the <em>telos</em> or ‘fulfillment’ of <em>hōrā</em>, ‘seasonality’, in immortal life, which is achieved in the setting of hero cult, as we will see in Hour 13§§11-22. Such a concept of <em>telos</em> as ‘fulfillment’ is also expressed by an adjectival derivative of <em>telos</em>, which is <em>teleia</em>, used as a cult epithet that conventionally describes the goddess <em>Hērā</em>. That is, <em>Hērā</em> is the goddess of <em>telos</em> in the sense of ‘fulfillment’.</p>
