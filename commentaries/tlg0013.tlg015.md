# Homeric Hymn to Herakles 4-6

<p>The words used here in telling about the ordeals of Hēraklēs match closely the words used at the very beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em> to tell about the ordeals of Odysseus:</p><p>|1 That man, tell me O Muse the song of that man, that versatile [<em>polu-tropos</em>] man, who in very many ways |2 veered from his path and wandered off far and wide, after he had destroyed the sacred citadel of Troy. |3 Many different cities of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>noos</em>]. |4 Many were the pains [<em>algea</em>] he suffered in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] while crossing the sea |5 struggling to merit [<em>arnusthai</em>] the saving of his own life [<em>psūkhē</em>] and his own homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] as well as the homecoming of his comrades [<em>hetairoi</em>]. </p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 1.1-5</p><p>|1 ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ |2 πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε· |3 πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω, |4 πολλὰ δ’ ὅ γ’ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν, |5 ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.</p>

# Homeric Hymn to Herakles 4-6

<p>I highlight again the <em>ponoi</em> or ‘labors’ of Socrates, which he equates with his <em>planē</em> or ‘wandering’ all over the world, as it were, in the course of his unending spiritual journey. The wording that Socrates uses here evokes the experiences of heroes like Hēraklēs himself. For example, the canonical Labors of Hēraklēs are described this way in a <em>Homeric Hymn</em>: </p><p>|4 He [= Hēraklēs] used to travel all over the boundless earth and all over the sea, |5 veering from his path and wandering off, all because of the missions assigned to him by Eurystheus the king. |6 He [= Hēraklēs] performed many reckless things on his own, and he suffered many such things in return. </p><p><em>Homeric Hymn to Herakles</em> 4-6</p>
