# Odyssey 16.418-433

<p>  </p><p>In this passage Penelope appeals to Antinoos in a way that follows the model of the invocational theme. It refers to memory in order to elicit the desirable action, and the usual phrase for it is <em>ἦ οὐ μέμνῃ</em>, “or do you not remember” (e.g. O.24.115). Here, however, we have a variation on the formulaic phrase, as Penelope says <em>ἦ</em> <em>οὐκ</em> <em>οἶσθ&#x27;</em>, “or do you not know,” to introduce a reminiscence on how Odysseus protected Antinoos’ father from the angry people. Penelope’s appeal corresponds to the invocational theme in also including a command: <em>σε παύεσθαι κέλομαι</em>, “I order you to stop” (O.16.433; compare the invocational theme at O.24.114). Furthermore, Penelope introduces a past favor to remember – an appeal to the rules of reciprocity. She has chosen a particularly relevant example, one that allows to draw clear parallels between the situation of Antinoos’ father in the past and what the son himself is doing in the present. Just as the people wanted to kill his father, so now the suitors, with Antinoos spearheading the plans, are plotting to kill Telemakhos (O.4.660-672, and again at O.16.363-392). And just as the people also wanted to eat up Antinoos’ father’s livelihood, so the suitors are eating up that of Odysseus (or Telemakhos) – correspondences that Penelope herself points out specifically (O.16.431-432). What is more, Penelope refers to a social institution that entails bonds of obligation, which has been established between Odysseus and Antinoos’ father: <em>hiketeia</em>, ‘supplication’, or the relationship between the suppliant and the supplicated created through the ritual (cp. <em>xenia</em>, ‘guest-friendship’) – and these bonds are hereditary. Here Penelope reminds Antinoos of the very institution itself by using a specific term, <em>ἱκέτας</em>, “suppliants,” (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.422; also <em>ἵκετο</em>, “[Antinoos’ father] came [as a suppliant],” O.16.424) to indicate it, and spells out both the origin of this special relationship between his family and that of Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.424-430), and how Antinoos is breaking it in the current situation (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.421-22, 431-32). </p><p>It should not, then, take much <em>noos</em>, ‘understanding’, ‘intelligence’, ‘mind’, to get the message, but does Anti-<em>noos</em> get it? He does not get a chance to respond as Eurymakhos takes over, assuring Penelope Telemakhos has nothing to fear – while plotting his demise (O.16.419-448). But neither of the two suitors give an indication that Penelope’s speech has the desirable effect, as Eurymakhos’ immediate response and Antinoos’ subsequent behaviour show. He instead proves to be worthy of his name, ‘Counter-<em>noos</em>.’ It is this faculty, <em>noos</em>, which is needed in good working order to avoid transgressing the rules of social and cosmic order, and the lack of which is associated with incurring <em>mēnis</em>, the sanction guaranteeing the maintenance of this order. Memory, in a role complementing that of <em>mēnis</em>, also upholds this order and these rules, and does so by keeping one mindful, in the right way, of the proper course of action. In addition to containing a variation on the invocational theme’s formulaic phrase appealing to memory, then, Penelope’s speech diverges from it also in not eliciting the morally desirable action.  </p><p>See further: </p><p>Gould, John. 1973. “ΗΙΚΕΤΕΙΑ.” <em>The Journal of Hellenic Studies</em> 93:74-103. </p><p>Moran, William Stephen. 1975. “Μιμνήσκομαι and ‘Remembering’ Epic Stories in Homer and the Hymns.” <em>Quaderni Urbinati di cultura classica</em> 20:195-211.</p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

# Anchor comment on extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative

<p>Here is what Antinoos threatens to do to Iros if this beggar loses the fight with the disguised Odysseus, O.18.085–087: Iros will be put on a ship and sent off from the island of Ithaca over to the mainland, and there the hapless beggar will be handed over to a mysteriously infernal figure named Ekhetos, who will proceed to cut off his prisoner’s nose and ears and then ‘pull out’ his genitals, feeding them to the dogs. I have a special reason for choosing to focus on these horrific torments in presenting my anchor comment on extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative. Here is the reason: these same horrific torments, which are imagined here at O.18.085–087 as happening only in the future, become realities later on, at O.22.474–479. But who will inflict the same torments in this later passage? Will it be the infernal Ekhetos? No, in this case, the agents of torment will be Philoitios the cowherd and Eumaios the swineherd, perhaps with the help of Telemachus, the son of Odysseus. True, the person who is punished at O.22.475–477, the goathered Melanthios, is presented as a morally negative character, no better than the beggar Iros. But the persons who inflict the torments in this passage are understood to be morally positive. See the comment at O.22.437–479. So, an explanation is still needed for understanding how these supposedly righteous men could ever bring themselves to the point of inflicting horrors that were parallel to the horrors potentially inflicted by the mysteriously infernal Ekhetos. Part of an explanation can be found in another passage, O.21.308–309, where Antinoos commands the disguised Odysseus not even to make an attempt at stringing the bow: if you persist, Antinoos threatens, you will be sent off to that infernal character Ekhetos. Although the words of Antinoos leave unmentioned here at O.21.308–309 any threatened loss of nose and ears and genitals, his earlier words at O.21.300–301 have already compared Odysseus to a Centaur named Eurytion, whose ears and nose were indeed chopped off by his outraged hosts after he misbehaved at their feast. For more on the story of Eurytion the Centaur, see the comment at O.21.288–310.  </p>

Although <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’ here at O.01.001 does not explicitly refer to singing as does <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’ at I.01.001, the narrative that the Master Narrator narrates is notionally a song in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>.

# Odyssey 1.002

<p>We have seen that the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> as designated by the driving word <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the accusative, <em>andra</em> at O.01.001, used here as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’. Now we see that this epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 is immediately followed at O.01.001–002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: Odysseus veered many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. Similarly, we saw that the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ at I.01.002 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Iliad</em> as designated by the driving word <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the accusative, <em>mēnin</em> at I.01.001, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. And we saw that this epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ is immediately followed at I.01.002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable suffering. And we will see a further similarity when we consider the epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327, which describes the poetic subject of a performed narration as designated by the driving word <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the accusative, <em>noston</em> at O.01.326, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. This epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 is then immediately followed in the same verse by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative there.

# Odyssey 1.223

<p>This is the first occurrence of Penelope's name in the <em>Odyssey</em>. Πηνελόπεια is a <em>nom parlant</em> and signals Penelope's belonging to a thematically related group of women in myth. The name was perceived as significant in antiquity and a linguistically unobjectionable derivation from the name of a bird, πηνέλοψ, was known to Didymus (as attested by Eustathius' <em>Commentarii ad Homeri Odysseam</em> 1.65.36). The etymology of the word πηνέλοψ itself is obscure beyond the second part of the compound, derived from the *h<sub>3</sub>ek<sup>ṷ</sup> root and meaning "looking (like)" (Chantraine 2009, s.v. ὄπωπα, πηνέλοψ). Nevertheless, the relevance of the <em>penelops</em> to Penelope can be ascertained. The <em>penelops</em> appears to be a bird similar to a halcyon. According to Aristotle <em>Historia Animalium (</em>593b23) the <em>penelops</em> is a small waterbird and lives at sea. <em>Penelopes</em> are mentioned together with halcyons in Aristophanes <em>Birds</em> 298 and Ibycus fr. 317a PMG. In the latter fragment, <em>penelopes</em> are described as ποικίλαι (2), αἰολόδειροι (2), and possibly also ἁλιπορφυρίδες (3), if Schneidewin's reconstruction is correct (Schneidewin 1833.128-131). <em>Penelopes</em> are said to be ποικιλόδειροι and τανυσίπτεροι in Alcaeus 345 L-P.2. Of these epithets the <em>penelops</em> shares with the halcyon ποικίλος ‘of varied color’ and τανυσίπτερος ‘long-winged’. If ἁλιπορφυρίδες is correctly restored, then this too allies the <em>penelops</em> to the halcyon, which is described by the rare epithet ἁλιπόρφυρος in Alcman 26 PMG.4. The <em>penelops</em> in Alcaeus 345 L-P. and the halcyon in Alcman 26 PMG are represented as (respectively) flying over the waves and coming from Okeanos. In poetry and myth, the (female) halcyon characteristically faithful to her mate, laments when the mate is lost, and is tied to the solar symbolism of death and rebirth (e.g. Alcman 26 PMG, Simonides 508 PMG, Aristotle, <em>Historia Animalium</em> 8.542b4, Dionysius, <em>De Avibus</em> 2.7, Plutarch <em>On the Intelligence of Animals </em> 983a). These features are shared by a mythological character whose name derives from the name of the bird, Alkyone, the wife of Keyx (Hesiod, fr. 10a.94-96 M, fr. 10d MW, Ovid, <em>Metamorphoses</em> 11.410-748, Ps.-Apollodorus 1.7.4). Alkyone is a woman dominated by faithfulness to her husband, for whom she laments and finally dies when he departs on a long sea voyage and does not return. Just as Penelope's story is morphologically similar to that of Alkyone, so are the two birds that give them their names. Being similar to the halcyon, the <em>penelops</em> is a fitting match for Penelope, among whose dominant features are faithfulness to her husband and lament for him while he is absent. An argument has also been made that Penelope takes part in the operation of the overarching solar metaphor in the <em>Odyssey</em> (Levaniouk 2011:298-312). The similarities between the two myths parallel those between the two bird-named women and also those between the two birds. The connections appear to be systemic rather than accidental. Penelope and Alkyone have further points of contact with yet another woman with a bird's name, Aedon the nightingale, to whom Penelope compares herself in <em>Odyssey</em> 19.518. Penelope and Alkyone are closer to each other than to Aedon, though all three share key features, the most important being their laments. In the same way, <em>penelops</em> and halcyon are more similar to each other than to the nightingale, but both have associations with the latter. Both ποικιλόδειρος and αἰολόδειρος (the epithets of the <em>penelops</em> in Alcaeus and Ibycus respectively) are epithets of the nightingale (Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 203; Nonnus <em>Dionysiaca</em> 26.211). In Ibycus’ fragment <em>penelopes</em> and halcyons are represented as sitting πετάλοισιν ἐπ' ἀκροτάτοις ‘on the topmost leaves’, literally ‘petals’, a <em>topos</em> about the nightingale (<em>Odyssey</em> xix 520, <em>Homeric Hymn to Pan</em> 17-18, <em>Anthologia Palatina</em> 12.2.3, 12.136.3). Since the halcyon's voice is described in the same terms as that of the nightingale and since, like the nightingale, the halcyon is imagined as a woman transformed into a bird and forever lamenting, it is likely that the <em>penelops</em> too is a bird of lament similar to the nightingale and the halcyon and that, as with the nightingale (Nagy 196:59n.1), the compounds with -δειρος applied to it (ποικιλόδειρος and αἰολόδειρος) signify the quality of its voice rather than the color of its neck. For a fuller discussion of the name's significance see Levaniouk 2011:287-318.

# Odyssey 1.003

<p>Etymologically, the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ indicates <em>consciousness</em> as distinct from the <em>unconsciousness</em> of <em>sleeping</em>, <em>swooning</em>, and <em>death</em> itself. This noun is derived from the verb-root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’. The root *<em>nes</em>- has a deeper meaning as well: ‘come to’, in the sense of ‘come back to consciousness’. Another noun derived from *<em>nes</em>- is <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of / about homecoming’. This noun nostos also has a deeper meaning: ‘coming back to light and life’. See the comment on O.01.05. Two definitive books on the Greek reflexes of the root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’: Frame 1978 and 2009. I add here a special note on my translation of O.01.003: ‘Many different cities of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>nóos</em>]’. I translate <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ here as ‘way[s] of thinking’ because the wording says that Odysseus gets to know different ways of thinking by making contact with many different persons in the course of all his travels. Because he gets to know their different ways of thinking, his knowledge now makes it possible for Odysseus himself to think in many different ways. So he is getting to know his own ‘mind’ differently by getting to know the different minds of others.  </p>

# Odyssey 1.320/Anchor Comment on thūmos 'heart' and on phrenes as 'heart'

<p>The noun <em>thūmos</em>, which I translate here as ‘heart’, expresses in Homeric diction the human capacity to feel and to think, taken together. In some Homeric contexts, <em>thūmos</em> is used as a synonym of <em>phrenes</em>, which can also be translated as ‘heart’, as in my comment on O.01.089. In other Homeric contexts, on the other hand, <em>thūmos</em> is pictured as the vital force that is contained by the <em>phrenes</em> (details in GMP 113n111). Even in such contexts, both words can be approximated as ‘heart’. In other still contexts, <em>phrenes</em> is best translated as ‘thinking’.  Such a meaning is not contradictory, since Homeric diction leaves room for the idea that you can think with your heart. </p>

Two definitive books on the Greek reflexes of the root *<em>nes- </em>‘return, come back’: Frame 1978 and 2009. As for <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the sense of ‘song of homecoming’, see O.01.326–327. </p>

# Odyssey 1.7

<p>The companions of Odysseus are destroyed because of their own <em>atasthaliai</em> ‘deeds-of-recklessness’. The narrative emphasizes that the companions must own their mistakes. It is essential to note here that the destruction of the companions here is caused not by the Will of Zeus: rather, they are destroyed because they suffer the consequences of doing what they did <em>of their own free will</em>. I add a further note here: I translated the plural of <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ here as ‘deeds-of-recklessness’ in order to convey the fact that a singular noun expressing an abstraction can refer to concrete examples of the abstraction when it is used in the plural. So for example <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ is an abstraction, but here at O.01.007 the plural <em>atasthaliai</em> refers to concrete examples of recklessness—in this case, the recklessness is exemplified by the killing and eating of the Cattle of the Sun. </p>

Each one of these books has its own <em>index locorum</em>. My colleague Anita Nikkanen, an Associate Editor for this online project, tracked the sequences of Homeric verses as listed in the indices for six of these books and then summarized my comments on those verses. Following up on her meticulous work, I am in the process of converting her summaries into a form of commentary. My comments on the <em>Odyssey</em> as I presented them in <em>Classical Inquiries</em> are merely samplings of the content that I hope to contribute to the overall commentary, to which a number of other colleagues are also contributing their own comments. That said, I now proceed to offer a sampling of comments on Rhapsody 1.

# Odyssey 1.1-10

<p>|1 That man, tell me O Muse the song of that man, the one who-turns-into-many-different-selves [<em>polutropos</em>], who in very many ways |2 veered from his path and wandered off far and wide, after he had destroyed the sacred [<em>hieron</em>] citadel of Troy. |3 Many different cities [<em>astea</em>] of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>nóos</em>]. |4 Many were the pains [<em>algea</em>] he suffered in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] while crossing the sea [<em>pontos</em>], |5 struggling to merit [<em>arnusthai</em>] the saving of his own life [<em>psūkhē</em> ] and his own homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] as well as the homecoming of his companions [<em>hetairoi</em>]. |6 But do what he might he could not save his companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], even though he very much wanted to. |7 For they perished through their own deeds-of-recklessness [<em>atasthaliā</em> plural], |8 disconnected [<em>nēpioi</em>] as they were, because of what they did to the cattle of the sun-god Hēlios. |9 They ate them. So, the god [Hēlios] deprived them of their day of-homecoming [<em>nostimon</em>]. |10 Starting-from-any-single-point-of-departure [<em>hamothen</em>], O goddess, daughter of Zeus, tell-me-as-you-have-told-those-who-came-before-me [<em>eipe kai hēmīn</em>].</p><p>There are three main points to be made in my comments here.</p><p>Point 1.</p><p>The epic of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em> begins in a way that resembles closely the beginning of its twin, the epic of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. The main theme of the <em>Odyssey</em> is signaled right away. The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the epic. This word is the noun <em>andra</em> ‘man’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>anēr</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ here marks this noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’, O.01.001. The Master Narrator is addressing a goddess who is the Muse of the <em>Odyssey</em>, asking the goddess to narrate for him the story of a man who is not yet named as Odysseus. The ‘man’ is the subject of the story. In other words, he is the subject of the narration, or the <em>narrative subject</em>. And this <em>narrative subject</em> is the<em> grammatical object</em> of the verb <em>ennepein</em>, meaning ‘narrate, tell’. Similarly at the beginning of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, as analyzed at I.01.001–012, the narrative subject is the first word in the very first verse. That word is the noun <em>mēnin</em> ‘anger’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>mēnis</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>mēnis</em> there marks that noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’, I.01.110. There the Master Narrator is addressing a <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’ who is the Muse of the <em>Iliad</em>, asking that goddess to sing for him that anger, I.01.001. The song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. That song is The Song of the Anger, in the sense that the anger <em>is</em> the song. The anger is the narrative subject. Similarly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the Master Narrator calls on the Muse of the Odyssey to ‘narrate the man’, that is, to ‘tell the song of the man’. Here too the song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. This song is The Song of the Man, in that the man <em>is</em> the song. The man is the narrative subject. And the song captures the total reality of the man. </p><p>Point 2.</p><p>But this reality is not so easy to capture, since the man who is Odysseus is many-sided, as we will now see. Odysseus at O.01.001 is <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’. This translation makes explicit what is only implied in an alternative way of rendering this elusive word, ‘versatile in many ways’ (H24H 0§21, also 9§4, also 10§2), where the Latin root <em>vert</em>- ‘turn’ of the Latinate word <em>versatile</em> can mean not only ‘turn around’ but also ‘turn into a different self’, as we see most clearly in the Latin word for ‘werewolf’, <em>versi</em>-<em>pellis</em>, which literally means ‘he whose skin has turned’ (Pliny <em>Natural History</em> 8.34; Petronius 62; details in GMP 264–265). Similarly, <em>polutropos</em> applies to <em>a figure who is different at every turn</em>, and who becomes different many times and in many ways. That is why the ultimate shape-shifter, the god Hermes, is <em>polutropos</em> in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> (verses 13, 439). And that is why, in the only other context where Odysseus is described as <em>polutropos</em>, O.10.330, he is associated in that context with his polytropic model, Hermes himself, O.10.331–332. (Further commentary in GMP 34.) Since Odysseus can turn into something different at every turn, the multiplicity of angles to be seen at every turn helps explain why this hero will not yet be named at the beginning of the Odyssey. </p><p>Point 3.</p><p>There is still more to be said about this adjective <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ describing Odysseus at O.01.001: it is used here as an <em>epithet for the narrative subject</em>, which in this case is <em>anēr</em> ‘man’. Another such epithet is the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ describing the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles at I.01.002. </p>

# Odyssey 1.1-2

<p>We have seen that the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> as designated by the driving word <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the accusative, <em>andra</em> at O.01.001, used here as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’. Now we see that this epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 is immediately followed at O.01.001–002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: Odysseus veered many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. Similarly, we saw that the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ at I.01.002 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Iliad</em> as designated by the driving word <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the accusative, <em>mēnin</em> at I.01.001, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. And we saw that this epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ is immediately followed at I.01.002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable suffering. And we will see a further similarity when we consider the epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327, which describes the poetic subject of a performed narration as designated by the driving word <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the accusative, <em>noston</em> at O.01.326, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. This epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 is then immediately followed in the same verse by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative there. See the comment on O.01.326–327.  </p>

<p>Athena announces here her plan to visit Telemachus in order to ‘arouse’ him and ‘put spirit in his mind’. These two expressions mean the same thing. When Athena carries out her plan she disguises herself, in Book 1, as Mentes, a foreign trader, and then, in Books 2 and 3, as Mentor, an old man of Ithaca, and both these names mean the same thing, ‘he who arouses, he who stirs up’. The noun <em>menos</em>, ‘spirit’, in Od. 1.89 contains the same verbal root <em>men</em>- as the names <em>Mentēs</em> and <em>Mentōr</em>, and the occurrence of the noun in Athena’s speech anticipates her two disguises. For the meaning of the name <em>Mentōr</em>, particularly in relation to the name <em>Nestōr</em>, see the essay “Nestor’s Name”. As ‘he who stirs up’ the name <em>Mentōr</em> implies an active verb *<em>menō</em>, ‘stir up’, which does not occur in Greek. The active verb with the meaning ‘stir up’ is <em>epotrunō</em>, which is what occurs in Athena’s speech. To make the verbal connection with the names <em>Mentēs</em> and <em>Mentōr</em> the verb <em>epotrunō</em> is glossed in Athena’s speech by the phrase with <em>menos</em>. For more on the verb <em>(ep)otrunō</em> in relation to the name <em>Mentōr</em>, see Frame 2009:25n37.</p>

tags: nēpios ‘disconnected’, A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 1.8

<p>The Homeric contexts of <em>nēpios</em>, as the work of Edmunds 1990 | 2016 has shown, point to an etymology involving a combination of the negative prefix *<em>n̥-</em> with the root *<em>Hp-</em> in the sense of ‘connect’, as in Latin <em>in-eptus</em> ‘non-connected’, not with the root *<em>u̯ekw-</em> in the sense of ‘speak’, as in Latin <em>in-fāns </em>‘non-speaking’. What is at stake in the meaning of <em>nēpios</em> is connectivity with parental models and, by extension, with ancestral models. The connectivity may be merely behavioral, as in the case of young animals that survive by staying connected to the older animals that generated them. In the case of humans, the connectivity that begins at infancy is not only behavioral but also mental, extending into adult patterns of consciously following ancestral models of behavior. Further, such connectedness to models may be not only mental but also emotional and even moral. And to be disconnected from such models runs the risk of being doomed for destruction, as we see here at O.01.008 in the case of the companions who followed Odysseus. Their disconnectedness is moral as well as mental. </p>

<p>The Olympians habitually go to the realm of the Aethiopians, situated on the banks of the cosmic river Ōkeanos, to dine with them there. The Aethiopians simultaneously inhabit the Far West and the Far East. This simultaneity is a mark of a theme that can best be described as a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. See the comments on I.01.423–425. Here at O.01.022–026, only Poseidon is visiting the Aethiopians. Unlike other humans, the Aethiopians still dine with the gods. Other humans have been separated from the gods and must therefore sacrifice to them instead of dining with them. </p>

Near the beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, by contrast, Zeus himself declares that mortals are unjustified in saying that the <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ that they suffer, O.01.034, are caused by the gods. The god continues: it is of their own free will, O.01.033–034, that mortals commit <em>atasthaliai</em> ‘deeds of recklessness’, O.01.034, and so their pains are <em>huper</em> <em>moron</em> ‘beyond what is fated’, O.01.034. See already the relevant comments at O.01.007. So, mortals are unjustified in trying to hold the gods legally responsible, as expressed by the verb <em>aitiâsthai</em> ‘hold responsible’, O.01.032.  </p>

On the meaning ‘song of homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.326–327. On <em>kleos</em> in the sense of an overall reference to the ‘glory’ of poetry, see the comment on I.02.325. Here at O.01.088–095, we can see that <em>nostos</em> as a ‘song of homecoming’ is a prerequisite for the quest of Odysseus to achieve the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry. Odysseus will receive the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of his own <em>Odyssey</em> only if he achieves a successful <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, and it is the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry that turns his <em>homecoming</em> into a <em>song of homecoming</em>. What the goddess says at O.01.094 is not that Telemachus will learn <em>about</em> the <em>nostos</em> of Odysseus if he is fortunate enough to hear <em>about</em> it. In the original Greek text, the noun <em>nostos</em> is the direct object of both the verb <em>punthanesthai</em>, ‘learn’ and the verb <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’ at O.01.094 here, and that is why I chose to translate the verse this way: ‘and thus he will learn [<em>punthanesthai</em>] the return [<em>nostos</em>] of his dear [<em>philos</em>] father, if by chance he [= Telemachus] hears [<em>akouein</em>] it’. Elsewhere too in the <em>Odyssey</em>, we see nostos as the direct object of <em>punthanesthai</em> ‘learn’: O.02.215, O.02.264, O.02.360, O.04.714—as also of <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’: O.01.287, O.02.218, O.02.360. It is not a question of learning <em>about</em> a homecoming, of hearing <em>about</em> a homecoming. Rather, Telemachus will learn the actual song of the homecoming, the song of <em>nostos</em>, by hearing it. He will actually hear the song from the hero Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and from the hero Menelaos along with his divine consort Helen in <em>Odyssey</em> 4. (This formulation is epitomized from <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5951.part-i-hour-9-the-return-of-odysseus-in-the-homeric-odyssey">H24H 9§20</a>; see also Stone 2016.09.28.)  </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OdysseyAthena_1280.png" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Athena (1810).

tags: menos ‘mental power’, Athena as mentor, Méntēs and Méntōr, A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 1.88-1.89

<p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 9§17.) At a council of the gods, the goddess Athena declares her intention to go to Ithaca to become a mentor to the young hero Telemachus, O.01.088–089. Descending from Olympus and landing in Ithaca, the goddess assumes the human form of a fatherly hero named <em>Méntēs</em>, O.01.105, who proceeds to give wise advice to the young hero. In a subsequent intervention, O.02.268, the goddess will assume the human form of another fatherly hero, named <em>Méntōr</em>, and, as in the present intervention, this other father-substitute will likewise proceed to give wise advice to the young hero. These two names <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em> are both related to the noun <em>menos</em>, which I translate as ‘mental power’. This word, as we can see here at O.01.089, refers to the heroic ‘power’ that the goddess Athena says she will put into Telemachus. The noun <em>menos</em>, usually translated as ‘power’ or ‘strength’, is derived from the verb-root <em>mnē-</em>, meaning ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113). Likewise derived from this verb-root are the agent nouns <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em>, which both mean ‘he who connects mentally’. When a divinity connects a hero to his heroic mentality, the hero will have <em>menos</em>, that is, ‘power’ or ‘strength’. To have heroic power or strength, you have to have a heroic mentality.

# Odyssey 1.153-1.155

<p>The singer of tales here, named Phemios, O.01.154, is ‘singing’ for the suitors as his audience, and the word translated as ‘sing’ here is <em>aeidein</em> at O.01.154 and at O.01.155. Such a singer is not exactly the equivalent of a “court poet,” since Phemios is singing for the suitors against his will, that is, he is singing <em>anankēi</em> ‘by way of constraint’, O.01.154. And what kind of a singer is this Phemios? He sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055. In Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, Phemios is described as a <em>rhapsōidos</em> ‘rhapsode’. The description is accurate in the sense that rhapsodes were professional performers of Homeric poetry in the classical period, as we see clearly in the overall context of Plato’s <em>Ion</em>. But this same description is inaccurate in the sense that rhapsodes in the classical period performed Homeric poetry without accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’: as we see overall in Plato’s <em>Ion</em> and elsewhere, the rhapsodic form of ‘singing’ Homeric poetry was basically <em>recitative</em>, with reduced melody. By contrast, as we read in Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, performers in the classical period who sang with full-blown melody while accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’ were called <em>kitharōidoi</em> ‘citharodes’, that is, <em>‘kitharā-singers’</em>. In other words, these ‘lyre-singers’ were performers of what we call <em>lyric</em>. At the festival of the Panathenaia in Athens during the classical period, these lyre-singers or citharodes competed with each other in singing <em>lyric</em>, while rhapsodes competed with each other in singing <em>epic</em>. As we can learn from Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, the prototypical citharode was considered to be Orpheus, while the prototypical rhapsode was Phemios. But Phemios, even though he sings epic and not lyric, is not exactly a rhapsode in the classical sense of the term: as I have already pointed out, Phemios sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055. Nevertheless, Plato has a point in considering Phemios a prototypical rhapsode, since what he sings is epic, which is what rhapsodes recite in the classical period—and which is not what citharodes any longer sing. On Phemios as a singer of epic, see the comment on O.01.325–327. </p>

<p>The text as transmitted by Aristarchus reads:</p><p>πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθὲ καὶ εἴρεο Νέστορα δῖον,</p><p>κεῖθεν δὲ Σπάρτηνδε παρὰ ξανθὸν Μενέλαον·</p><p>ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων.</p><p>‘First you [= Telemachus] go to Pylos and ask radiant Nestor</p><p>and then from there to Sparta and to golden-haired Menelaos,</p><p>the one who was the last of the Achaeans, wearers of bronze tunics, to come back home.’</p><p>But the text as transmitted by Zenodotus reads:</p><p>πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθέ, …</p><p>κεῖθεν δ’ ἐς Κρήτην τε παρ’ Ἰδομενῆα ἄνακτα,</p><p>ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων.</p><p>‘First go to Pylos …</p><p>and then from there to Crete and to king Idomeneus</p><p>who was the last of the Achaeans, wearers of bronze tunics, to come back home.’</p><p>Here at O.01.284–286, as also already at O.01.093, the variant reading that we see transmitted by Zenodotus (quoted in the scholia for O.03.313) indicates a variant epic tradition to which I have already referred as a <em>Cretan Odyssey</em> in my comment on O.01.093. As I argue in Nagy 2015.09.24§§36–37, what we see in these variant verses is a trace of a Cretan Odyssey as primarily represented in our <em>Odyssey</em> by the “Cretan lies,” which are micro-narratives embedded in the epic macro-narrative of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>. In comments forthcoming, there will be more to say about these “Cretan lies.” Here I confine my comments to points that are relevant to what we read at O.01.093 and O.01.284–286. In “our” <em>Odyssey</em>, as Nestor reports at O.03.191–192, Idomeneus after the Trojan War returns to Crete with all his men safe and sound. In the Cretan Odyssey, by contrast, Idomeneus seems to have traveled with Odysseus after the conquest of Troy by the Achaeans, and this king of the Cretans even experienced, together with Odysseus, the horrors of the Cave of the Cyclops: such a story about joint adventures experienced by Idomeneus and Odysseus is attested in a painting on a red-figure stamnos, 480 BCE, featuring the name-tags ΙΔΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ ‘Ida-meneus’ [sic] and ΟΔΥΣΥΣ ‘Odusus’ [sic] appended to images of these two heroes, showing each one of the two clinging to a ram’s underbelly (Levaniouk 2011:105). </p>

The idea of <em>menos</em> as ‘mental power’ is elegantly recapitulated here at O.01.320–321. The goddess Athena has just finished the first phase of her role as mentor to Telemachus. She had initiated this phase at O.01.088–089 after having assumed, as we saw at O.01.105, the human shape of the fatherly <em>Méntēs</em>. This name <em>Méntēs</em>, as I indicated in the comment on O.01.088–089, means ‘he who connects mentally’. Having finished with the role of <em>Méntēs</em>, the goddess now transforms herself into a bird and flies out of the palace through a lightwell on the roof, and what we see here at O.01.320–321 is the wording that describes what Athena had accomplished so far in connecting the mind of Telemachus with the mind of his father. In her role as <em>Méntēs</em>, ‘he who connects mentally’, the goddess has given to the hero Telemachus the <em>menos</em> or ‘mental power’ of connecting with the heroic identity of his father. That act of doing this is expressed here at O.01.321 by the verb<em> hupo-mnē-</em>, which means literally ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113). But the mental connectivity of Telemachus is not yet complete, as we will see in the comment on O.01.346–352. </p>

# Odyssey 1.326-1.327

<p>The syntax here in O.01.326–327 shows that the use of the noun <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 as the grammatical object of <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’ in the same verse makes this same noun the narrative subject of the song that is being sung by the singer Phemios. The <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ is the song that the singer sings, and so the ‘homecoming’ is also a ‘sing of homecoming’. My translation ‘song of homecoming’ is meant to show that the homecoming is the song. The placement of the adjective <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 as an epithet for the narrative subject <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the previous verse at O.01.326 is parallel to the placement of the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ at I.01.002 as an epithet for the narrative subject <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the previous verse at I.01.001. See the comment on I.01.001–002. Another parallel is the placement of the adjective <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 as an epithet for the preceding narrative subject <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the same verse. There is further parallelism to be noted here. The epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 for the narrative subject <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative here: Athena caused misfortune for some of the Achaeans. Similarly, the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> at I.01.002 for the narrative subject <em>mēnis</em> at I.01.001 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable misfortune. See the comment on I.01.002. Also, the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 for the preceding narrative subject <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the same verse is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: the hero Odysseus suffered many misfortunes by veering many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. </p>

<p>For Penelope, the song that is sung by the singer Phemios, which is supposed to turn the deeds of men and gods into the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry, as we saw at O.01.338, produces the opposite effect here at O.01.342. The song sung by Phemios reminds her of her missing husband Odysseus, making her feel <em>penthos alaston</em> ‘grief unforgettable’, O.01.342. This expression signals lament, which is presented here as antithetical to the kind of <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that is heard by the audience of Phemios, who are the suitors of Penelope. The personal involvement of Penelope in the song of Odysseus is what makes the kleos that she hears different from the <em>kleos</em> that the suitors hear. For her the <em>kleos</em> contains <em>penthos</em>, while for them it does not. Relevant here is the meaning of the name of Phemios, as analyzed in the comment on O.02.035: in terms of that analysis, Phemios is a singer whose songs mean more than what is meant by that singer. </p>

# Odyssey 1.346-352

<p>Telemachus argues with his mother, defending the song that is sung by the singer Phemios about misfortunes experienced by heroes in the course of seeking a successful homecoming. There is a pleasure in the hearing of such a song, Telemachus says at O.01.346–347. Evidently, he does not yet understand the personal involvement of Penelope in the story of such homecoming—or of course his own involvement—because he does not yet understand that the ultimate character in the ultimate story of homecoming will be Odysseus himself. Telemachus speaks positively about the reception of the song of homecoming as sung by the singer Phemios. He says that the audience gives glory to the song, and the verb that is used in his wording is <em>epi-kleiein</em> at O.01.351, which I translate as ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’. I render the <em>epi</em>- of <em>epi-kleiein</em> here as ‘and pass it on’, in the sense that <em>epi</em>- conveys the idea of ‘in addition to, on top of’, supplementing -<em>kleiein</em> in the sense of ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>]’. The wording of Telemachus is justifiable to the extent that the glory of heroes and gods as produced by the singer produces also glory for the song itself as received by the audience. That is to say, this verb <em>epi-kleiein</em> ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’ is reciprocal: there is not only the giving of glory by the audience to the song sung by the singer but there is also the giving of glory by the singer to the song that he sings. Thus it is justifiable for Telemachus to say that the greatest glory goes to the <em>aoidē</em> ‘song‘, O.01.351, that is <em>neōtatē</em> ‘newest’, O.01.352, since the glory to be transmitted must be the latest glory to be received. The reception by the most recent audience must be decisively successful. What Telemachus does not yet understand, however, is that the most recent audience for an ongoing song of homecoming will be not the suitors but the ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>. The audience of the <em>Odyssey</em> will be the definitive audience for the reception of this ongoing song of homecoming. And, for that ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the ultimate hero of the song of homecoming will be Odysseus himself.  </p>

# Odyssey 2.63-79

<p>Telemakhos appeals to the principle of reciprocity in his address to the Ithacans: his speech shows that feasting, such as the suitors are undertaking at Odysseus’ house, is a matter that calls for reciprocation (when correctly conducted; <em>Od</em>. 2.74-78). Conversely, an evil turn should likewise be reciprocated by an evil turn, another aspect of reciprocity that Telemakhos’ words make clear, and which their chiastic arrangement further underscores (δυσμενέων κάκ’ ἔρεξεν … κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες ‘[if Odysseus,] bearing ill-will, did evil deeds … you are doing evil deeds, bearing ill-will,’ <em>Od</em>. 2.72-73). The Ithacans’ not stopping the suitors would in Telemakhos’ words be explicable as a return for an earlier bad turn by Odysseus, but if that is not the case, they deserve as punishment the <em>mēnis</em> of gods (<em>Od</em>. 2.66-67).</p><p>As for what <em>mēnis</em> is, let us take a step back and look at some elements in Telemakhos’s speech: he describes the wrongs of the suitors (<em>Od</em>. 2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – <em>mēnis </em>of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (<em>Od</em>. 2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (<em>Od</em>. 2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, <em>mēnis</em> is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of <em>mēnis</em> and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order. (Compare the speech of Mentor at <em>Od</em>. 2.229-241, in my note on which I discuss <em>mēnis</em> and memory, which works towards the same end as <em>mēnis</em> but in a symmetrically opposite manner, and the ethical function of the two further. With regard to reciprocity, Mentor, in contrast to what Telemakhos says here, is clear on the point that there has been no earlier bad turn by Odysseus that would justify the current outrage in Ithaca, and so, the people deserve a punishment as a reciprocation for their actions).</p><p>To return to reciprocity: just as <em>mēnis</em> has a moral dimension and a function in upholding the proper social and cosmic order, so, too, is reciprocity involved in morality. Reciprocal exchange is a total social phenomenon in the Maussian sense of the term, such that reciprocal exchange is also an articulation of the social order, of the cosmic hierarchy, and an instance of the working of <em>themis</em> (the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior) – it is worth noting here that Telemakhos appeals to Themis in his speech (<em>Od</em>. 2.68). <em>mēnis</em> in fact protects the rules of exchange and the hierarchy of proper cosmic order, and reciprocity and <em>mēnis</em> are thus interconnected. Telemakhos’ speech neatly illustrates this web of interconnected concepts, and his argument relies on understanding their role within the Homeric society.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Mauss, Marcel. 1990. <em>The Gift: The form and reason for exchange in archaic societies</em>.

# Odyssey 2.229-241

<p>The wording of Mentor’s address to the assembly demonstrates the ethical dimension of the archaic Greek concept of memory: the failure of the people of Ithaca to respect Odysseus and behave appropriately towards him and his household is attributed to their not remembering him. Conversely, the speech also indicates that such forgetful subjects deserve harsh rulers (O.2.230-234): memory is the principle that maintains good social interactions and proper social order, and its absence brings about the opposite. Mentor’s name, ‘he who reminds,’ ‘he who stirs up’, is not inappropriate to the context, either.</p><p>Comparing Mentor’s speech with that of Telemakhos earlier in the assembly (O.2.45-69; some of what I discuss here is also included in my comment on O.2.63-79), we see further dimensions of memory as the principle that maintains proper social order. Telemakhos in his speech describes the wrongs of the suitors (O.2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – in his speech, it is <em>mēnis </em>of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (O.2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (O.2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, <em>mēnis</em> is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of <em>mēnis</em> and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order.</p><p>Likewise, then, we find all three elements of Telemakhos’ speech in that of Mentor’s, albeit with slight changes: the wrongs of the suitors are there (O.2.235-238) and the blame is extended to their solidarity group, the Ithacans (O.2.239-241, also O.2.233-234). Where there is a notable difference, however, is in the principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs: while in Telemakhos’ speech it is <em>mēnis</em>, in Mentor’s it is memory (O.2.233). However, Mentor makes clear that what is being perverted is the sovereign order, that of Odysseus’ position as the king over the Ithacans (O.2.230-234): this complements the role of <em>mēnis</em> in maintaining cosmic order, including the hierarchies of the sovereign order between and among gods and men. To underscore the parallelism of their speeches, at this very point Mentor’s words even echo those of Telemakhos’ (cp. πατὴρ δ’ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν ‘and how kind a father he was’, Telemakhos at O.2.47 and Mentor at O.2.234). Memory thus appears as the flipside of <em>mēnis</em>: just as the latter’s function is maintaining the cosmic order as a sanction, a punishment for transgressing the rules, memory is the principle that promotes behavior that agrees with cosmic order.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

# Odyssey 2.382

<p>This line marks the first occurrence in the <em>Odyssey</em> of a formulaic expression"then he/she thought of other things"(ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἀλλ᾽ ἐνόησε) that occurs, with minor variations, eleven times in the <em>Odyssey</em> and twice in the <em>Iliad</em>. The formula shows interesting patterns of restriction in both poems. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, it is always used with a female subject (Athena [2.382, 2.393, 4.795, 5.382, 6.112, 18.187, 23.242, 23.344], Helen [4.219], Nausikaa [6.251], or Penelope [16.409]). In the <em>Iliad</em>, it is used exclusively of Achilles (23.140, 23.193). See <em>Iliad</em> 23.140 for discussion of the two Iliadic instances; here I concentrate on the formula’s occurrences in the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>From a narratological point of view, the expression has an important function: as noted by de Jong 2001:66, it “highlights a new, often sudden or unexpected turn in the story,” in this case “the—abrupt—change of scene from Telemachus to Athena.” In other words, the formula marks the development of the plot in a new direction that is not a mere continuation of what has preceded. (<em>Odyssey</em><em> </em>23.242 is a significant exception.) Furthermore, it links this new development with the intervention of some specific agent, who is thus momentarily represented as controlling the plot. De Jong 2001:66 notes that the frequency with which the expression is used of Athena corresponds to the goddess’s “role of ‘director’ of the story of the <em>Odyssey</em>.” Occurrences of the formula with Helen, Nausikaa, and Penelope as subjects extend this plot-making power to other prominent women. In this way, a convenient narrative device serves also to underscore one of the poem’s major thematic concerns, namely, the way in which the story of Odysseus’ homecoming—the plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>—depends upon the favorable disposition of certain women, above all Penelope. The poem has numerous ways of signaling that its plot hinges on female agents (see <em>Odyssey </em>11.226, <em>Odyssey </em>11.436-39). This should not, however, be interpreted as a subversive gesture: as stressed by Murnaghan 2005, Athena as “source and sponsor” of the <em>Odyssey</em>’s plot works to uphold the authority of the patriarchal <em>oikos</em>.</p>

The formula asking for remembering and reciprocation, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι καί μοι… ‘remember them for me now and [do something] for me’ (O.3.100) after mentioning the earlier favor(s) is repeated elsewhere in similar contexts, and so appears to be traditional (these exact same lines are repeated in Telemakhos’ appeal to Menelaos at O<em>.</em>4.328-331, and the formula recurs also in Penelope’s prayer to Athena at O.4.762-766).</p>

# Odyssey 3.130-3.183/ Anchor Comment on two variant myths in Odyssey 3 and Odyssey 4, part 1

<p>Epitomized from Nagy 2015 §§69–75: </p><p>[§69] In <em>Odyssey</em> O.03.130–183, old Nestor is telling a tale to young Telemachus about the various homecomings of the Achaeans after they succeeded in conquering the city of Troy. (Nestor’s tales of homecoming in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 reflect poetic traditions of great antiquity, which are analyzed most incisively and intuitively by Frame 2009:180–193.) The tale is told from the perspective of Nestor’s own experiences. My point of departure is a detail at O.03.169, where Nestor says that he and a group of his fellow Achaeans stopped over at the island of Lesbos on their way home from Troy, O.03.169. One time before and one time after their stopover at Lesbos, Nestor and his group participated in making sacrifices. The story about the first of these two sacrifices, as we will see [§75], contradicts a story in Song 17 of Sappho, which tells about a single sacrifice that involves Agamemnon and Menelaos. </p><p>[§70] The first of the two sacrifices mentioned by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 takes place at the island of Tenedos, O.03.159, which is situated directly to the west of Troy. By contrast, the island of Lesbos is further away, to the southwest of the Trojan coastland. In <em>Odyssey</em> 3, the divine recipients of the sacrifice at Tenedos are designated only in general terms, as <em>theoi</em> ‘the gods’, O.03.159. Then, continuing their voyage back home from Troy, Nestor and his group set sail from Tenedos, and their next stopover, as already noted, is the island of Lesbos, O.03.169. </p><p>[§71] After their stopover at Lesbos, O.03.169, Nestor and his group continued their sea voyage back home. Next, they sailed over the open sea, with no more stopovers, until they reached the city of Geraistos, at the southern tip of the island of Euboea, O.03.177. By now the homecoming of this group of heroes was nearly complete, since the island of Euboea is situated right next to the European mainland. And here, at Euboea, Nestor participated in the second of the two sacrifices to which I have been referring, O.03.178–179. This second sacrifice involving Nestor was meant as a signal of thanksgiving for the successful homecoming of his group of Achaean voyagers, and the divine recipient of the sacrifice here is specified as the god Poseidon, O.03.178, whom Nestor and his fellow Achaeans honored by slaughtering, according to his tale, a multitude of bulls, O.03.178–179. </p><p>[§72] So, the second sacrifice attended by Nestor and his group, which took place on the island of Euboea, was a success. But the first sacrifice, which he had also attended and which had taken place on the island of Tenedos, was a failure. The failure, as narrated by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, can be linked with a quarrel that broke out, evidently in the context of the feasting that followed this first sacrifice. The quarrel is marked by the word <em>eris</em> ‘strife’, O.03.160. Compare the words <em>erizein</em> ‘have strife’ at I.01.006 and <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at I.01.008, with reference to the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon. In the case of the <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at O.03.160, who quarreled with whom? The narrative answers the question: the two heroes who quarreled with each other were Nestor and Odysseus, O.03.161–166.</p><p>[§73] This quarrel between Nestor and Odysseus, O.03.161–166, cannot be understood without first considering an earlier quarrel that is central to the narration of <em>Odyssey</em> 3, and the narrator is once again Nestor. According to the tale as Nestor tells it, the two Sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos, had quarreled with each other right after their victory at Troy. In this case as well, quarrel is marked by the word <em>eris</em> ‘strife’, O.03.136. And, as a result of this quarrel, all the Achaeans had split into two groups, so that half of them followed Menelaos as he sailed off from Troy to Tenedos while the other half stayed with Agamemnon at Troy, O.03.130–158. In terms of this story, <em>Agamemnon intended to perform a sacrifice of one hundred cattle to the goddess Athena before leaving Troy</em>, O.03.143–144, but Menelaos, leading half of the Achaeans, had sailed off together with Nestor and Odysseus and Diomedes <em>before such a sacrifice could take place</em>, O.03.153–154. It was only after Menelaos and his half of the Achaeans stopped over at the nearby island of Tenedos that they arranged for their own sacrifice there, O.03.159. And it was there at Tenedos that a second quarrel broke out—the quarrel between Nestor and Odysseus, O.03.161–166. </p><p>[§74] This second quarrel in the tale told by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 resulted in a splitting of the group that had sided with Menelaos after the original splitting of all the Achaeans into one separate group siding with Menelaos and another separate group siding with Agamemnon. What resulted from the new split after the quarrel between Nestor and Odysseus was that Odysseus, together with his followers, now sailed off from Tenedos back to Troy in order to rejoin Agamemnon there, O.03.160–164, while Nestor together with Diomedes sailed on from their stopover at the island of Tenedos and arrived with their followers at the next stopover, at the island of Lesbos, O.03.165–169. When Nestor and Diomedes were already at Lesbos, O.03.169, they were joined there by Menelaos, <em>who arrived later</em>, O.03.168.</p><p>[§75] And here I stop to highlight the contradiction between the story as told here in the <em>Odyssey</em> and the story as told in Song 17 of Sappho. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, we see that Menelaos came to Lesbos, but there is no mention here of Agamemnon. In Song 17, by contrast, it seems that both brothers came to Lesbos [Nagy 2015 §50]:</p><p>|1 πλάϲιον δη μ̣[.....]...οιϲ᾿ α̣[ ̣ ̣ ̣ ̣]ω |2 πότνι’ Ἦρα, ϲὰ χ[…..]ϲ̣  ̣ἐόρτ[α] |3 τὰν ἀράταν Ἀτρ[έϊδα]ι̣ π̣ό̣ηϲαν |4 τόι βαϲίληεϲ, |5 ἐκτελέϲϲαντεϲ μ[εγά]λ̣οιϲ ἀέθλοιϲ̣ |6 πρῶτα μὲν πὲρ Ἴ̣[λιον]· ἄψερον δέ̣ |7 τυίδ’ ἀπορμάθεν[τεϲ, ὄ]δ̣ο̣ν γὰρ̣ εὔρη̣[ν] |8 οὐκ ἐδ[ύναντο⌋, |9 πρὶν ϲὲ καὶ Δί’ ἀντ[ίαον] π̣εδέλθην̣ |10 καὶ Θυώναϲ ἰμε̣[ρόεντα] π̣αῖδα· |11 νῦν δὲ κ[αί..... …] ]...πόημεν |12 κὰτ τὸ πάλ̣[αιον {464|465} |13 ἄγνα καὶ κα̣[..... ὄ]χλοϲ |14 παρθέ[νων..... γ]υναίκων |15 ἀμφιϲ̣.[…] |16 μετρ’ ὀ̣λ̣[ολύγαϲ].</p><p>|1 Close by, …, |2 O Queen [<em>potnia</em>] Hera, … your […] festival [<em>eortā</em>], |3 which, vowed-in-prayer [<em>arâsthai</em>], the Sons of Atreus did arrange [<em>poieîn</em>] |4 for you, kings that they were, |5 after first having completed great labors [<em>aethloi</em>], |6 around Troy, and, next [<em>apseron</em>], |7 after having set forth to come here [<em>tuide</em>], since finding the way |8 was not possible for them |9 until they would approach you (Hera) and Zeus lord of suppliants [<em>antiaos</em>] |10 and (Dionysus) the lovely son of Thyone. |11 And now we are arranging [<em>poieîn</em>] [the festival], |12 in accordance with the ancient way […] |13 holy [<em>agna</em>] and […] a throng [<em>okhlos</em>] |14 of girls [<em>parthenoi</em>] […] and women [<em>gunaikes</em>] |15 on either side … |16 the measured sound of ululation [<em>ololūgā</em>]. </p><p>Sappho Song 17.1–16</p><p>On the reading τόι (with the acute accent preserved in P.GC inv. 105 fr. 2) , see Nagy 2015 §50.</p>

# Odyssey 3.130

<p>Nestor’s story about the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ of the Achaeans’ is in and of itself a ‘song of / about homecoming’, as we see from the description of this <em>nostos</em> as <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’, an adjective that is used here as an epithet of the narrative subject. See the comment on O.01.326–327, where <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 is described as <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327. See also the comment on I.01.002, where the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’, describing <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the previous verse, I.01.001, is likewise an epithet of the narrative subject. In that case, the narrative subject is the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles. Similarly in the context of the ‘disastrous [<em>lugros</em>] homecoming [<em>nostos</em>]’ of the Achaeans here at O.03.130, there is a foregrounding of <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, at O.03.135. In this case, the anger emanates from the goddess Athena herself.  </p>

# Odyssey 3.132-135

<p>As the cause of Athena’s <em>mēnis </em>here shows, besides failing to remember and therefore to act appropriately, failing to be νοήμων ‘thoughtful,’ ‘intelligent,’ ‘in possession of <em>noos</em> [mind]’ and δίκαιος ‘just’ can also lead to behavior that transgresses against the cosmic order. Words indicating mental qualities such as <em>noos</em>,<em> noēmōn </em>and <em>phrenes</em> are linked to the good kind of mindfulness and memory indicated by words such as <em>mimnēskomai</em>, and lack of them is associated with behavior that incurs <em>mēnis </em>(cp. I.15.128-129). In contrast to the Argives’ failures with respect to their minds and their subsequent punishment, a good mind is given as the reason for unfailing good conduct, for example Eumaios in his sacrifices to the gods on account of his good <em>phrenes</em> (O.14.420-421; cp. also O.24.194-195).</p>

What follows is an epitome of Nagy 2017 §§101–103, 105–106:</p><p>[§101] I interpret the wording of O.03.168–169 to mean that Menelaos arrived too late to participate fully in a sacrifice of one hundred cattle <em>at Lesbos</em>. And the place for this sacrifice to happen would have been the precinct of Hera on that island. From the standpoint of the local myth that originated from Lesbos, as I have argued with reference to Song 17 of Sappho (Nagy 2015 §§51–67), both Agamemnon and Menelaos had announced-in-prayer, already at Troy, the arrangement of a festival for Hera at Lesbos, and what was wished-for in return was to find the best possible way to achieve a safe homecoming from Troy. So, in terms of my argument, what was announced-in-prayer was the performing of a sacrifice as the centerpiece of the festival to be arranged, but only one of the Sons of Atreus did his part in at least trying to make the sacrifice a success. That was Agamemnon. As for the other Son, Menelaos, he somehow failed to do his part. And, in terms of my reconstruction, it was because Menelaos arrived too late for the sacrifice. Similarly, as we will see in <em>Odyssey 4</em>, Menelaos arrived too late in his homecoming: by the time he got home, he was too late to save his brother—and he was too late even to avenge his brother’s death, since Orestes, son of Agamemnon, had already done so by killing Aigisthos, O.04.546–547. </p><p>[§102] This theme of <em>failing by being late</em> is an essential piece of my overall reconstruction of the myth about a sacrifice of one hundred cattle at Lesbos—a sacrifice that is featured as the climax of the festival that was announced-in-prayer by the Agamemnon and Menelaos in Song 17 of Sappho (again, Nagy 2015 §§51–67). In terms of this reconstruction, Agamemnon sailed to the island and arranged to sacrifice one hundred cattle to Hera there, but Menelaos joined him only after the sacrifice was already in progress, since he did not arrive at Lesbos on time. In terms of this reconstruction, the quarrel between the Sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos, must have happened during the feast that followed the sacrifice at Lesbos, just as the quarrel between Nestor and Odysseus happened at the feast that followed the sacrifice at Tenedos.</p><p>[§103] Menelaos seems to be idiosyncratic in his arrivals at sacrifices. For a striking example, see the comment on I.02.402–429. In that passage, we see a mental link between Menelaos and Agamemnon, allowing one brother to read the mind of the other.  </p><p>[§105] At Lesbos, by contrast, it seems that the mental link between the brothers has somehow been broken. That is why Menelaos fails to arrive in time for the festival. And now the quarrel between Menelaos and Agamemnon ensues. So, who is to blame? Perhaps it was Menelaos, who was late. Or perhaps it was Agamemnon, who might have forgotten to invite Menelaos, assuming that his brother was still reading his mind.</p><p>[§106] But what was the quarrel about, anyway? Here I must add one last relevant detail to be found in <em>Odyssey 3</em>. As Nestor is recounting the moment when Menelaos arrives late at Lesbos, O.03.168–169, he himself adds the detail that I have in mind here: the fact is, Nestor and Diomedes and the other Achaeans who were there at Lesbos were already ‘deliberating’, O.03.169 (ὁρμαίνονταϲ), about two alternative ways of continuing their sea voyage. I argue that, in the version of the myth originating from Lesbos, Agamemnon was also part of these deliberations, and then the latecomer Menelaos joined in as well. I must stress that, although Menelaos was late for the sacrifice at Lesbos, he would have been there for the feasting that happened after the sacrifice. That was when, in terms of my reconstruction, the deliberations took place—and that was when the quarrel between the Sons of Atreus broke out in the version of the story that originated from Lesbos. </p>

tags: alternative ways to sail home from Troy, A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 3.170-3.178

<p>What follows is an epitome of Nagy 2017 §§107–108:</p><p>[§107] In the deliberations, as narrated in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, about two alternative ways for the Achaeans to sail home after their conquest of Troy, one of the two ways was to take the sea route north of Chios, thus venturing into the open sea and heading straight for the island of Euboea, O.03.170–171. The alternative way was to take the sea route south of Chios, O.03.172. That was the safer way. Nestor goes on to say that he and Diomedes and their followers, before deciding which sea route to take, had consulted a divinity, not named, who advised that they should head straight for the distant island of Euboea, thus taking the more direct sea route, O.03.173–178. In this version of the story as transmitted in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, Menelaos and his followers sailed along with Nestor and Diomedes, Ο.03.276–277. Or, to say it more precisely, Menelaos sailed with them at least as far as Cape Sounion. </p><p>[§108] Here I reconstruct another aspect of the alternative version of the story, originating from Lesbos, that told about the deliberations following the sacrifice performed by Agamemnon at Lesbos. After the deliberations, Agamemnon did not sail along with Nestor and Diomedes, and, instead, he took the more indirect sea route after he left Lesbos, while Menelaos, unlike Agamemnon, had taken the more direct sea route, choosing the same way that was chosen by Nestor. In terms of this alternative version, I argue, the deliberations about choosing between more direct and less direct sea routes led to a quarrel between Agamemnon and Menelaos, who disagreed about which way was the right way. I see an irony built into the idea that the setting for the quarrel would have been the sacrifice at Lesbos—and that Menelaos had been late in arriving at that ritual event. And, as I have already noted [§101], he will also be late—eight years too late—in arriving back home, O.04.546–547, even though he had chosen the more direct route from Lesbos. </p>

# Odyssey 3.202-3.224

<p>The syntax of the wording at O.03.205–207 indicates that Telemachus is on the verge of giving up hope, but the fuller use of comparable syntax in the wording of Nestor at O.03.218–224 reaffirms the hope. Telemachus uses a curtailed form of the syntax and then overtly says that his wish is impossible—only to be corrected by Nestor, who uses a full form. Telemachus wishes that the gods could give him the <em>dunamis</em> ‘power’ to kill the suitors: αἲ γάρ ἐμοὶ τοσσήνδε θεοὶ δύναμιν περιθεῖεν ‘if only the gods would grant me a power so great’, O.03.205. Then, instead of giving a premise as grounds of hope, he gives up hope by claiming that the gods have granted such a power neither to him nor to his father, O.03.208–209. At this point Nestor responds by resorting to a full form of the idiom: εἰ γάρ σ’ ὣς ἐθέλοι φιλέειν γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη | ὡς τότ’ Ὀδυσσῆος περικήδετο κυδαλίμοιο | δήμῳ ἔνι Τρώων ‘If only Athena with the looks of the owl would deign to love you | as surely as in those days she cared for glorious Odysseus in the district [<em>dēmos</em>] of Troy’, O.03.218–220.

<p>We see at work here the mythological convention of naming a son after a primary heroic trait of the father, as in the case of the son of Ajax, whose name <em>Eurusakēs</em> means ‘the one with the wide shield [<em>sakos</em>]’; this meaning is made explicit in the wording of Sophocles Ajax 574–578. See the comment on I.22.506–507 with reference to the the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, which means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. This meaning is relevant to the heroic role of the father as <em>protecting a citadel from sieges</em>. Such a role is expressed by the very name of Hector, <em>Héktōr</em>, which is an agent noun meaning ‘one who holds [<em>ekhein</em>]’ in the sense of ‘one who protects’. In the case of <em>Megapenthēs</em>, the meaning of his name as ‘the one with the great sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’ is made explicit by references to the great <em>penthos</em> ‘sorrow’ experienced by the Achaeans in reaction to a most painful wounding of Menelaos in the context of the Trojan War, I.04.197, I.04.207. Also viewed in general are the sorrows of the Trojan War itself, which Menelaos expresses in detail at O.04.093–112. See the comment on O.04.093–116. As we will see at O.04.220–226, Helen attempts to neutralize such sorrows by drugging the wine to be poured for the feast hosted by Menelaos in honor of Telemachus: the word for this drug is <em>nēpenthes</em>, Ο.04.221, which can be interpreted as ‘negating sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’. </p>

# Odyssey 4.43-4.75

<p>Epitomized from Nagy 2016.02.18 §§1–4</p><p>[§1] The wording about to be quoted describes the very first impression experienced by the young hero Telemachus when he sees the splendor of the place of Menelaos and Helen. We join the action as Telemachus and his traveling companion, the young hero Peisistratos, son of Nestor, are both being escorted into the palace of Menelaos and Helen:</p><p>|43 αὐτοὺς δ’ εἰσῆγον θεῖον δόμον. οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες |44 θαύμαζον κατὰ δῶμα διοτρεφέος βασιλῆος· |45 ὥς τε γὰρ ἠελίου αἴγλη πέλεν ἠὲ σελήνης |46 δῶμα καθ’ ὑψερεφὲς Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο. |47 αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τάρπησαν ὁρώμενοι ὀφθαλμοῖσιν . . .</p><p>|43 They were escorted inside the heavenly [<em>theion</em>] palace. Seeing what they were seeing, |44 they were filled with awe [thauma] as they proceeded through the palace of the king, that man whose origins are celestial. |45 There was a gleam [<em>aiglē</em>] there, which was like the gleam of the sun or the moon, |46 spreading throughout that palace famed for its high ceilings, that home of radiant Menelaos. |47 But then, after they had feasted their eyes on what they saw . . .</p><p>O.04.043–047</p><p>[§2] At this point, the story proceeds to take the visitors through a series of welcoming rituals, followed by a grand dinner arranged by Menelaos as the gracious host, O.04.047–070. And now the dinner conversation gets underway, starting with words of appreciation spoken by Telemachus and intended for Menelaos. Telemachus speaks here as a grateful guest, addressing his fellow guest Peisistratos, son of Nestor, but his words are really intended for Menelaos as the generous host. I will now quote these words of Telemachus as spoken to the son of Nestor—words that not only compliment Menelaos but also express most sincerely the young guest’s awestruck reaction to the splendor of the king’s palace:</p><p>|71 “φράζεο, Νεστορίδη, τῷ ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ, |72 χαλκοῦ τε στεροπὴν κατὰ δώματα ἠχήεντα |73 χρυσοῦ τ’ ἠλέκτρου τε καὶ ἀργύρου ἠδ’ ἐλέφαντος. |74 Ζηνός που τοιήδε γ’ Ὀλυμπίου ἔνδοθεν αὐλή, |75 ὅσσα τάδ’ ἄσπετα πολλά· σέβας μ’ ἔχει εἰσορόωντα.”</p><p>|71 “I want you to notice something, son of Nestor, you who are so dear to my heart: |72 notice the flash [<em>steropē</em>] of bronze [<em>khalkos</em>] as its light pervades the echoing hall |73 and also the flash of gold and of electrum and of silver and of ivory. |74 I’m guessing that Zeus, who lives on Olympus, has such a hall inside his palace, |75 and he would have as many indescribable things as are here. A sense of holy awe [<em>sebas</em>] takes hold of me as I look at these things.”</p><p>O.04.071–075</p><p>[§3] What first catches the young man’s eye here is all the shining bronze he sees. And then it’s the gold, then the electrum, then the silver, and finally the ivory. But the first impression is the bronze, all that bronze. The light that he sees streaming from the bronze envelops everything with its radiance, and it’s just like heaven for the young man.</p><p>[§4] “Thought I’d died and gone to heaven.” The colloquial saying that I just quoted, which has become the title of a popular song recorded in 1991 by Bryan Adams, captures the young man’s awareness that he has just experienced something celestial. The reduced theology of this kind of imagined heaven resembles the celestial realm of the ancient Greek gods. Their ‘sky’ or <em>ouranos</em>, as we read at I.17.425, is traditionally visualized as ‘made of bronze’, <em>khalkeos</em> (χάλκεον οὐρανόν). This expression shows its own special kind of reduced theology: from out of the sky, when it’s bright, the gleam of a mighty bronze dome envelops everything on earth. Presiding over this bronze dome is the god Zeus, whose heavenly residence is called the <em>khalkobates dō</em>, ‘the palace with floor made of bronze’ (χαλκοβατὲς δῶ), I.01.426; I.14.173, I.21.438, I.21.505, O.08.321—a residence situated high above Mount Olympus, I.01.426, I.21.438, I.21.505. As we will see at O.07.084–090, the heavenly residence of Menelaos is comparable to the palace of Alkinoos (latinized as Alcinous), king of the Phaeacians. </p>

<p>Menelaos laments here the sorrows of the Trojan War, O.04.093–112, and Telemachus responds by weeping, O.04.113–116. These sorrows are accentuated by the personal involvement of heroes like Menelaos and Odysseus as main participants in the war. The very idea of lament, as signaled elsewhere by words like <em>penthos</em> and <em>akhos</em>, is seen here as an aspect of genuine narrative about the heroic world. As we are about to see, such a genuine narrative is to be contrasted with the false narrative induced by the drug <em>nēpenthes</em>, O.04.221, which prevents contact with the emotional world of lament.

<p>These verses, cited by Herodotus 2.116.1–117.1 derive from a narrative tradition that indicates more than one stopover for Paris=Alexandros and Helen after her abduction/elopement from Sparta. I epitomize here from HPC 75–79 [= I§§184–187]]:</p><p>Herodotus makes a point of distinguishing Homer from what he describes as the poet of the <em>Cypria</em>, and, in making this distinction, he actually quotes a passage from the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> to prove his point (Herodotus 2.116.1–2.117.1):</p><p>Δοκέει δέ μοι καὶ ῞Ομηρος τὸν λόγον τοῦτον πυθέσθαι· ἀλλ’, οὐ γὰρ ὁμοίως ἐς τὴν ἐποποιίην εὐπρεπὴς ἦν τῷ ἑτέρῳ τῷ περ ἐχρήσατο, [ἐς ὃ] μετῆκε αὐτόν, δηλώσας ὡς καὶ τοῦτον ἐπίσταιτο τὸν λόγον.

Ὅμηρος μέν νυν καὶ τὰ Κύπρια ἔπεα χαιρέτω. </p><p>I think that Homer was aware of this story [= the story of Helen in Egypt]. But, because it [= this story] was not as appropriate for epic composition as was the other one [= the other story] that he used, he omitted it, though he made it clear that he was aware of this story [= the story of Helen in Egypt] as well. It is clear on the basis of the way he composed in the <em>Iliad</em> (and nowhere else has he [= Homer] retraced his steps to this) the detour of Alexandros [= Paris]—how he [= Paris], as he was bringing Helen, was blown off course and was detoured in various places and then how he reached Sidon in Phoenicia. He [= Homer] mentions the story [of Helen in Egypt] in the part about the greatest deeds of Diomedes. And the epic words he says are as follows. </p><p>There they were, the <em>peploi</em>, completely pattern-woven [<em>poikiloi</em>], the work of women</p><p>from Sidon, whom Alexandros [= Paris] himself, the godlike, </p><p>had brought home [to Troy] from the land of Sidon, sailing over the vast sea, </p><p>on the very same journey as the one he took when he brought back home [to Troy] also Helen, the one who is descended from the most noble father.</p><p>[I.06.289–292] </p><p>He [= Homer] mentions it [= the story of Helen in Egypt] in the <em>Odyssey</em> also, in these epic words: </p><p>Such magical things she had, the daughter of Zeus,</p><p>things of good outcome, which to her did Polydamna give, wife of Thon.</p><p>She was Egyptian. For her, many were the things produced by the life-giving earth,</p><p>magical things—many good mixtures and many baneful ones.</p><p>[O.04.227–230] </p><p>And these other things are said to Telemachus by Menelaos: </p><p>I was eager to return here, but the gods still held me in Egypt,</p><p>Since I had not sacrificed entire hecatombs [<em>hekatombai</em>] to them. </p><p>[O.04.351–352] </p><p>In these epic verses the Poet makes clear that he knew of the detour of Alexandros [= Paris] to Egypt; for Syria borders on Egypt, and the Phoenicians whose territory is Sidon dwell in Syria. In terms of these epic verses, this shows most clearly that the epic of the <em>Cypria</em> is not by Homer but by someone else. For in the <em>Cypria</em> it is said that on the third day after setting sail from Sparta Alexandros [= Paris] arrived in Troy bringing Helen, having made good use of a favorable wind and smooth seas. In the <em>Iliad</em>, on the other hand, he [= Homer] says that he [= Paris] was detoured as he was bringing her [= Helen]. So much for Homer and the epic of the <em>Cypria</em>. </p><p>(A note on Herodotus 2.116.4–5.) I question the judgment of modern editors who bracket sections 4 and 5 of Herodotus 2.116. Granted, the topic in these sections is the detour of Menelaos and Helen in Egypt after the war at Troy, not the detour of Paris and Helen before the war. But these passages are relevant to what Herodotus says thereafter (2.118–119) about Helen in Egypt after the war. Herodotus is making the point that there are other Homeric stories about Helen in Egypt, whereas there are no other Homeric stories about Helen in Phoenicia.</p><p>I now offer a paraphrase of the arguments made by Herodotus here at 2.116.1–2.117.1:</p><p>In a non-Homeric version of an epic called the <em>Cypria</em> (a version known to Herodotus but not to us), it is said that Paris and Helen sailed to Troy without making any detour. There is an alternative version in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, and Herodotus quotes the relevant verses. In this version, it is said that Paris and Helen did make a detour: they went to Phoenicia before they went to Troy. On the basis of an Egyptian story about Paris and Helen, Herodotus goes on to argue that they went to Egypt as well as Phoenicia, and that Homer knew it. After all, Egypt is next to Phoenicia. But the problem is, Homer later elided the story of Helen in Egypt as inappropriate. So the <em>Iliad</em> tells the story about Helen in Troy, not the story about Helen in Egypt. And the <em>Odyssey</em> follows the <em>Iliad</em> in accepting the story of Helen in Troy. Both epics, however, show traces of the story of Helen in Egypt, though the traces in the <em>Iliad</em> are only indirect. </p><p>Next, I offer a critical analysis of this paraphrase:</p><p>Herodotus considers the stories about detours in Egypt and Phoenicia within the larger context of stories about Helen in Egypt. Upon retelling an Egyptian version of a story about a detour of Paris and Helen in Egypt after he abducted her from Sparta (2.112–115), Herodotus says that Homer must have known that story (2.116.1). Then, in order to show that this is so, Herodotus offers proof (2.116–117), quoting I.06.289–292 and O.04.227–230 together with O.04.351–352. The passage I.06.289–292 concerns the detour of Paris and Helen before the war at Troy while the passages O.04.227–230 and O.04.351–352 concern the detour of Menelaos and Helen after the war. The first passage is meant as indirect proof that the story of Helen in Egypt was recognized by Homer in the <em>Iliad</em> while the other two passages are meant as direct proof that the story of Helen in Egypt was recognized by Homer in the <em>Odyssey</em>. The passages from the <em>Odyssey</em> are relevant to what Herodotus goes on to argue about the story of Helen in Egypt: he finds that this story is more believable than the story of Helen in Troy (2.118–119). In the Egyptian version, Paris is forced to leave Helen behind in Egypt after the two of them are detoured there (2.115.5). That is where Menelaos finds her after the war. According to this Egyptian version, then, Helen never went to Troy. For Herodotus, this version makes more sense than the Homeric version that dominates the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. </p><p>I conclude by considering again the fact that Herodotus distinguishes Homer as the poet of the <em>Iliad</em> from the poet of the <em>Cypria</em>. This fact shows that the historian is familiar with the Panathenaic Homer. That is, he thinks of Homer as the poet of the two epics performed at the Panathenaia, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. Nevertheless, Herodotus does not presuppose that everyone thinks this way. That is why he makes a point of establishing the distinction in the first place. He speaks of the poet of the <em>Cypria</em> as someone who may be considered to be Homer by others, but Herodotus knows better. </p>

# Odyssey 4.227

<p>The application of this epithet ‘daughter of Zeus’ to Helen is an overt reference to her divinity. On the use of <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ as an epithet for goddesses, see the anchor comment at I.03.374. For more on the divinity of Helen, I epitomize from Nagy 2016.05.02 §§0–4: </p><p>[§0]The picturing of Helen as a ‘daughter of Zeus’ here at O.04.227 is a most fitting description of a goddess who was already worshipped at Sparta in an era as early as the second half of the second millennium BCE—an era that marks the rise and the eventual fall of an early Greek civilization that archaeologists recognize as the Mycenaean Empire. But there is a problem with this picture: how do we square the idea of Helen as goddess of Sparta with the idea of Helen of Troy as we see her come to life in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>? I hope to address this problem here by taking a second look at the idea of Helen’s ‘image-double’, the word for which in Greek was <em>eidōlon</em>. </p><p>[§1] Helen of Troy, as we know her in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, appears to be a woman, not a goddess. But the remarkable fact is—I spotlight its relevance from the start—that the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em> describes Helen here at O.04.227 by way of the epithet <em>Dios thugatēr</em>, which means ‘daughter of Zeus’. And I spotlight here another relevant fact that is even more remarkable: the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> describes Helen as <em>Dios ekgegauia</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ at I.03.199, I.03.418, and the same epithet occurs also at O.04.184, O.04.219, O.23.218. But the most remarkable relevant fact of them all is that <em>Dios thugatēr</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, as we see this epithet deployed elsewhere not only in the <em>Iliad</em> but also in the <em>Odyssey</em>, can be used only with reference to goddesses: Aphrodite at I.03.374 and I.05.131 and I.05.312, Athena at I.02.548 and I.04.128 and I.04.515, Artemis at O.20.061, Persephone at O.11.217, Ate at I.19.091, and the Muses at I.02.491–492 (plural) and O.01.010 (singular). These and other facts to be brought up later lead me to argue that, although Helen appears to be a woman and not a goddess in the <em>Iliad</em>, she is still a goddess. And I argue further that, despite appearances as poetically created in the <em>Iliad</em>, Helen is recognized even there as a goddess. In terms of my argument, then, Helen is recognized as a goddess not only in Sparta but also in the Troy or ‘Ilion’ of the <em>Iliad</em>, the name of which epic means of course ‘the song of Ilion’. And she is a goddess in ‘the song of Ilion’ precisely because she is Helen of Sparta.</p><p>[§2] Someone may object that, even if it is a fact that you have Zeus as your father, this fact alone is not enough to make you a goddess or a god. Your mother must also be a goddess. In other words, you have to have two divine immortals as your biological parents in order to be worshipped as an immortal divinity in your own right. After all, as I myself have argued in H24H 0§5, the dominant gene in the genetic code of ancient Greek mythmaking is mortality while the recessive gene is immortality, not the other way around. In other words, if the family tree that produced you includes even one solitary mortal ancestor, that will be enough to make you mortal as well—no matter how many immortal ancestors grace your genealogy. So, what about Helen’s mother in Sparta? If she were a goddess, then the status of Helen as a goddess in her own right would be a given.</p><p>[§3] In one version of the surviving myths about Helen, the mother of Helen is in fact a goddess, named Nemesis (Cypria fragment 7 ed. Allen, by way of Athenaeus 8.334b–d). In terms of this version, then, there is no question about the divinity of Helen. But things are more complicated. There are also other versions, native even to Sparta, where the mother of Helen is not Nemesis but Leda, as we read in the wording of a Spartan song dramatized by Aristophanes in the <em>Lysistrata</em> (line 1314). And this Leda, as we are about to see, is a mortal woman who is impregnated by Zeus. So, I am faced with a problem here. In terms of my own argumentation concerning mortality as the dominant gene, as it were, I should expect the mortality of Leda as mother to undo the divinity of Helen as daughter of Zeus. In other words, even the paternity of immortal Zeus would not be enough to cancel the mortality of a mortal mother.</p><p>[§4] But Leda is no ordinary mortal mother, since her impregnation by Zeus produces not only Helen but also two sons who are twins, commonly known in English by their Latin names Castor and Pollux—<em>Kastōr</em> and <em>Poludeukēs</em> in the original Greek—who are also known as the Dioskouroi, meaning ‘sons of Zeus’ in Greek. See the comment on I.03.237. I argue that the mythological identity of Helen as a goddess at Sparta can best be understood by contemplating the mythological identity of these two brothers of hers, the Dioskouroi. </p>

The formula asking for remembering and reciprocation, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι καί μοι… ‘remember them for me now and [do something] for me’ (O.4.331) after mentioning the earlier favor(s) is repeated elsewhere in similar contexts, and so appears to be traditional (in addition to Telemakhos’ appeal to Nestor at O.3.98-101, the formula recurs in Penelope’s prayer to Athena at O.4.762-766).</p>

# Odyssey 4.341-4.344

<p>In <em>Odyssey</em> 3, Nestor was telling young Telemachus tales about the adventures experienced by the Achaeans after their capture of Troy. Some of the tales involved the brothers Agamemnon and Menelaos. In the context of those tales, there was a mention of the island of Lesbos at O.03.169. And now in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, we get to know more about the adventures of Agamemnon and Menelaos after Troy, but here it is Menelaos himself who is telling tales about these adventures, and, in his tale, there is a detail about Lesbos that contradicts the tale told by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3. </p><p>Here I epitomize from Nagy 2015 §§ 77–78:</p><p>[§77] While telling his tale to Telemachus in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, Menelaos expresses a wish that the young man’s father, Odysseus, will return to Ithaca and will defeat the suitors of Penelope—just as this hero of the <em>Odyssey</em> had once upon a time defeated an opponent named Philomeleides in a wrestling match that had taken place on the island of Lesbos, O.04.341–344. The verses here at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.341–344 are repeated at 17.132–135, where Telemachus retells to Penelope the story told to him by Menelaos.</p><p>[§78] In terms of what Menelaos says at O.04.341–344, he was in Lesbos when Odysseus performed his heroic feat there. There is some agreement here with the narrative of Nestor at O.03.168–169, who says that Menelaos had sailed from Tenedos to Lesbos. So too had Nestor himself and Diomedes sailed to Lesbos, and they were already there by the time Menelaos arrived. See the comment on O.03.168–169. But the problem is, Odysseus himself did not sail from Tenedos to Lesbos in the narrative of Nestor: rather, as we saw at O.03.160–169, Odysseus together with a sub-group of Achaean followers had already sailed from Tenedos back to Troy in order to rejoin Agamemnon, who was still there at Troy, O.03.160–164, while Nestor and Diomedes together with their Achaean followers sailed on from their stopover at the island of Tenedos and arrived at the next stopover, which was the island of Lesbos, O.03.165–169. There, at Lesbos, Nestor and Diomedes were joined by Menelaos, who as we saw <em>arrived later</em>, O.03.168–169. In short, the parting of ways for Odysseus in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 had already happened on the island of Tenedos, when he had left Nestor and Diomedes and Menelaos in order to rejoin Agamemnon. Here in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, by contrast, Odysseus seems to be still present in Lesbos when Diomedes and Nestor and Menelaos are present in Lesbos. And that is how Menelaos could have witnessed the victory of Odysseus in a wrestling match at Lesbos.</p>

tags: mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking, dominant vs. recessive versions of myths, A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 4.343-344/ anchor comment on: two variant myths in Odyssey 3 and Odyssey 4, part 2

<p>Epitome from Nagy 2015§§79–91:</p><p>[§79] I argue that there were two variant myths at work in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and 4, and that these myths could never be completely reconciled with one another. Nor, as I also argue, did they ever really need to be reconciled. In Homeric poetry, there is a built-in awareness of mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking, and there are many examples where the poetry shows this awareness by ostentatiously including, without overt self-contradiction, details from recessive as well as dominant versions of any given myth. For another example, see the anchor comment at O.04.512–522 on: mutually contradictory local variations in mythmaking.</p><p>[§80] Keeping in mind the Homeric capacity to track such mutually contradictory local variations, let us consider the myth, as we saw it at work in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, about a grand sacrifice that took place on the island of Tenedos, O.03.159. Of the two Sons of Atreus, only Menelaos was present, while Agamemnon had stayed behind at Troy and was arranging a correspondingly grand sacrifice back there, to be attended by his half of the Achaeans—and that sacrifice was intended for Athena, Ο.03.143–145. As for the sacrifice at Tenedos, the divine recipients are not named, O.03.159. And, at the competing sacrifice on the island of Tenedos, arranged by Menelaos and attended by his half of the Achaeans, a quarrel broke out between Nestor and Odysseus, with the result that Odysseus and his followers went back to Agamemnon, O.03.160–164. After Tenedos, the only Achaean leaders who sailed on homeward with their followers were Nestor and Diomedes, O.03.165–167—to be joined later by Menelaos at Lesbos, O.03.168. </p><p>[§81] From here on, I refer to this ‘Tenedos version’ of the myth, O.03.159–164, as Myth One. But there is also a Myth Two, which is the ‘Lesbos version’, O.04.341–344. According to Myth Two, as we see it at work under the surface in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, <em>there was a grand sacrifice that took place on the island of Lesbos</em>, not on the island of Tenedos. At Lesbos, Odysseus was still together with Nestor and Diomedes—to be joined later by Menelaos. Unlike Myth One as we read it at O.03.159–164, which is a myth originating from Tenedos, this second variant myth originates from Lesbos. A signature of this Myth Two at O.04.341–344 is the reference, initiated by the speaking persona of Menelaos, to that primal wrestling match between Odysseus and Philomeleides on the island of Lesbos. In fact, there are traces of this Myth Two in sources external to Homeric poetry. As we learn from Hellanicus of Lesbos (FGH 4 F 150), the people of Lesbos had their own local stories about Philomeleides: he had been a king of theirs in the age of heroes, and he used to challenge visitors to engage with him in a wrestling match—but then his reputation for invincibility was undone by Odysseus, helped by Diomedes, when these heroes visited Lesbos. On Philomeleides of Lesbos, I have more to say in Nagy 2008:57. </p><p>[§82] I have so far left out a further detail in Myth Two as I have reconstructed it. According to this myth, which would be compatible with the myth as we see it at work in Song 17 of Sappho, Menelaos was not the only one of the two Sons of Atreus who visited Lesbos. <em>Also visiting was his brother Agamemnon</em>. </p><p>[§83] We have already seen that Myth One, compatible with the mythological traditions of Tenedos, situates the quarrel between Menelaos and Agamemnon at Troy, even before Agamemnon arranges for a sacrifice of one hundred cattle there. But now I argue that Myth Two, compatible with the mythological traditions of Lesbos, situates the quarrel of Menelaos and Agamemnon not at Troy—and certainly not at Tenedos—but rather at Lesbos. In Myth Two, as we are about to see, both Sons of Atreus visited Lesbos, and they quarreled there with each other. Further, we will see that such a quarrel between Menelaos and Agamemnon at Lesbos happened not before but after a grand sacrifice of one hundred cattle there. And, even further, we will see that the quarrel was linked with the ultimate failure of that sacrifice. </p><p>[§84] Here we return to Song 17 of Sappho, the relevant parts of which are quoted in the anchor comment at O.03.130–183 on two variant myths in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and <em>Odyssey</em> 4, part 1 at §75. The clearest sign of failure, in terms of the narrative embedded in Song 17 of Sappho, is the wish that we see being formulated in heroic times—when it was announced-in-prayer that a festival is to be arranged at Lesbos. The <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]) that was <em>arātā</em> ‘announced-in-prayer’ (3: ἀράταν)—in the context of an animal sacrifice, as I reconstruct it—was instituted in hopes of ‘finding the way’ back home from Troy (7: [ὄ]δ̣ο̣ν … εὔρη̣[ν]). Hera, as the primary divinity to whom it was announced-in-prayer that there would be a seasonally recurring festival at Lesbos, would be heeding the Sons of Atreus, who had prayed to her, imploring her to <em>help them find their way back home safe and sound.</em> </p><p>[§85] But the question remains: did Hera heed the prayer of the Sons of Atreus? In the mythical world of heroes, a wish expressed by a hero who makes an announcement-in-prayer to a divinity is often not heeded by the divinity. See the anchor comment at I.02.402–429 on prayers heeded or not heeded by gods; also the comment on I.04.118–121. </p><p>[§86] Similarly, in terms of my reconstruction of the announcement-in-prayer made by the Sons of Atreus in Song 17 of Sappho, the sacrifice that was announced-in-prayer by these heroes was a failure, since their wish to find the safest way back home was not granted to either one of them. In the case of Agamemnon, we will see that he was killed after having sailed home safely, O.04.514–537. As for Menelaos, he will be sailing around aimlessly for eight years before he finally finds his way back home. At least, that is what we read in the version of the story as told at O.04.082 (see [§98] below). </p><p>[§87] Before I can proceed with my reconstruction, I must first situate its relevance to Song 17 of Sappho. In this song, I argue, we see a reference to a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in the precinct of Hera at Lesbos, and this sacrifice is viewed, I also argue, as a failed ritual in the heroic past of a myth. In the myth, there is an announcement-in-prayer about performing the sacrifice, which will turn out to be a failure, whereas the seasonal reperforming of this sacrifice at the same place during the festival of Hera is expected to be <em>a successful ritual in the present time of reperformance</em> as signaled in the song. In Song 17, as we have already seen (§75), the persona of Sappho is praying to Hera herself, speaking to her about the <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]) that is being arranged in honor of the goddess. The speaking Sappho goes on to say that this festival, which ‘we’ in the present are arranging (11: πόημεν) as ‘we’ offer supplications to Hera, is being arranged ‘in accordance with the ancient way’ (12: κὰτ τὸ πάλ̣[αιον) of celebration. In terms of the reading that we find in the papyrus, both Agamemnon and Menelaos had arranged (3: π̣ό̣ηϲαν) such a festival in ancient times by virtue of having <em>announced-in-prayer the arrangement of such a festival</em> in the first place. These conquerors of Troy needed to offer their prayer to Hera, Zeus, and Dionysus (9-10), and, in that prayer, they were to announce the arrangement of the <em>eortā</em> ‘festival’ (2: ἐόρτ[α]), which was thus <em>arātā</em> ‘announced-in-prayer (3: ἀράταν). It is at this festival that the persona of Sappho is ‘even now’ praying to Hera, <em>nun de</em> (11). And, in terms of my reconstruction, I argue that the centerpiece of such a seasonally recurring festival at Lesbos was a <em>hecatomb</em>, that is, the sacrificial slaughter of one hundred cattle. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, see the comment on O.04.351–353.</p><p>[§88] So, the central question is this: if such a ritual of sacrificing one hundred cattle was a failure in the past time of the myth, how could it become a model for the success of that ritual as it exists in its own present time? </p><p>[§89] Such an idea of failure in myth and success in ritual is typical of an <em>aetiology</em>. I repeat here my working definition (see the comment on I.23.01–064 Point 1): <em>an aetiology focuses on a foundational catastrophe in the mythologized past that explains and thus motivates continuing success in the ritualized present and future</em>.  </p><p>[§90] An example of an aetiology that I have studied elsewhere in some detail is a complex of rituals and myths involving the god Apollo and the hero Pyrrhos at Delphi, where the overall ritual of slaughtering sheep and distributing in an orderly way their sacrificial meat inside the precinct of Apollo stands in sharp contrast with a myth, as reflected in Pindar’s <em>Nemean</em> 7 and <em>Paean</em> 6, about a disorderly distribution that resulted in the slaughtering of Pyrrhos himself when the hero arrived at Delphi to make sacrifice inside the precinct of the god (Nagy 2011a§§67–68, 70–72).</p><p>[§91] For another example of such an aetiology, I cite a story as retold by Herodotus (1.31.1–5) about a priestess of Hera and her two boys, named Kleobis and Biton. The mother and the two sons, all three of them, are involved as major characters in an aetiological myth about the ritual practice of the <em>hecatomb</em>, which was a sacrificial slaughtering of one hundred cattle in the precinct of the goddess Hera at the climax of the festival celebrated in her honor at Argos. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, see the comment on O.04.351–353. Also involved as major ‘characters’ in the story are two sacrificial oxen. The two boys, described as <em>āthlophoroi</em> ‘prize-winning athletes’, willingly took the place of the two sacrificial oxen, chosen to pull the wagon carrying the priestess across the plain of Argos—over a distance of 45 stadium-lengths—along a sacred way leading up to the precinct of Hera (1.31.2). The oxen had been late in arriving at the starting-point of the procession (again, 1.31.2), <em>and this lateness, in terms of the story, is the aetiological explanation for their replacement by the two athletes</em>. If these two oxen had not been late, they would have been slaughtered along with the other ninety-eight oxen that had been chosen for the mass sacrifice of one hundred cattle at the finishing-point of the procession, inside the precinct of Hera. At the feast that followed the sacrifice inside the precinct, the two boys died a mystical death after having pulled the wagon of the priestess from the starting-point all the way to this finishing-point of the procession (1.31.5). Thus, by way of this death that they shared with each other, the boys became sacrificial substitutes for the two premier victims of the animal sacrifice. (See Nagy 2015 ch. 4§142*1, with references to further commentary.) </p>

Hera had saved [<em>sōzein</em>] him. </p><p>O.4.512–513</p><p>Epitomized from Nagy 2015§§93–100:</p><p>[§93] By contrast with the temporary failure of Menelaos in his homecoming, as narrated by the hero himself at O.04.351–353, Agamemnon had already succeeded in sailing home, and Menelaos himself mentions this detail as he tells his own tale in <em>Odyssey</em> 4. In telling the tale, the explanation that Menelaos gives for his brother’s successful sea voyage is this: <em>because the goddess Hera had saved Agamemnon</em>. I note here the background: Proteus had told Menelaos about this salvation of Agamemnon from the sea, and that is how Menelaos knows about it. As he retells the tale to Telemachus, Menelaos is quoting here the words of Proteus about the success of Agamemnon at sea, to be contrasted with the temporary failure of Menelaos himself. </p><p>[§94] As we learn, then, from the words of Proteus in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, Agamemnon was in fact saved at sea, since his voyage by sea was successful. But then he was killed after he landed near home, ambushed by Aigisthos, and so the rest of his voyage, by land, became a failure O.04.514-537. After treacherously hosting him at a dinner, Aigisthos had slaughtered Agamemnon <em>as if that hero were some sacrificial ox that is being fed in a manger</em>, O.04.535. By contrast, the voyage of Menelaos by sea was ultimately successful, because he finally got around to making a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in Egypt, O.04.581–586. In making this sacrifice, Menelaos was following the instructions of Proteus, O.04.472–480, and, this way, he appeased the anger of the gods, O.04.583. Now Menelaos could at long last sail back to his homeland, safe and sound O.04.584–586. At I.05.714–717, Hera remarks to Athena that the two of them had promised to Menelaos a safe homecoming after the conquest of Troy.</p><p>[§95] We have seen, then, from the narrative of Menelaos in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, that Agamemnon was saved at sea by the goddess Hera, O.04.512–513. But why had Hera saved him? It was because, I argue, Agamemnon had at least tried to make a perfect sacrifice of one hundred cattle at Lesbos. By contrast, Menelaos had somehow failed to do his part in the corresponding sacrifice. In terms of my interpretation, based on the wording of Song 17 of Sappho, both Sons of Atreus had made an announcement-in-prayer about performing a sacrifice at Lesbos, but only Agamemnon succeeded in following through on that announcement.</p><p>[§96] I have already quoted the passage at O.04.252–254 where Menelaos says that the final phase of his sea voyage as he headed back home was held up by the gods precisely because he had not made a sacrifice of one hundred cattle. From the context, it is clear that this failure that made the gods so angry was a sin of omission, not commission. And his sin, I argue, was that<em> he somehow failed to perform a sacrifice of one hundred cattle at Lesbos</em>. But later on, when Menelaos does finally get around to performing a sacrifice of one hundred cattle in Egypt O.04.581–586, his performance is successful, and thus he finally appeases the anger of the gods, O.04.583. </p><p>[§97] The reader’s first impression may be that the sin of omission on the part of Menelaos, that is, his failure to perform a successful sacrifice of one hundred cattle, happens in Egypt: after all, the finding of a solution for the sin happens at this place—when Menelaos finally gets around to performing such a sacrifice. But such a first impression is wrong, I think, since Egypt was merely the last possible place as an occasion for such a sin of omission. There were many other places that Menelaos had visited before he ever reached Egypt, and Egypt had been for him merely the final stopover in the course of a most problematic overall sea voyage back home from Troy. Yes, the gods were in the process of punishing Menelaos <em>in</em> <em>Egypt</em> for his sin of omission when we see them interfering there with his sea voyage. And yes, the gods kept on interfering until Menelaos finally made the sacrifice, <em>in Egypt</em>, which was the place that turned out to be his point of departure in the very last phase of his sea voyage. But, as we will now see, the gods were already interfering with Menelaos in earlier phases of his sea voyage, and so the divine punishment for his sin of omission can be viewed as an ongoing series of misfortunes that kept on interfering with his travels after Troy. </p><p>[§98] The first such misfortune is already narrated by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, concerning the death, at Cape Sounion, of the hero Phrontis, who had been steering the ship of Menelaos, O.03.276–283. That death, caused by the god Apollo, O.03.279–280, holds back Menelaos from sailing ahead. Only after he conducts a proper funeral for his companion, O.03.284–285, does he recommence his sea voyage. Then, as Menelaos sails past the headlands of Maleiai, his ships are blown off course: some are swept away to Crete, where they run aground and are shattered, O.03.286–299, while five of them reach Egypt, O.03.299–300. (The details here are parallel to what is narrated in the epic Cycle: <em>Nostoi</em>, Proclus summary p. 108 lines 20–23 ed. Allen 1912). In sharp contrast, the hero Nestor has a safe and swift sea voyage back home to Pylos, O.03.182–183, having evidently rounded successfully the headlands of Maleiai (I follow here the analysis of Frame 2009:184n79). Meanwhile, once he reaches Egypt, Menelaos takes to plundering and looting there, and he amasses vast treasures, O.03.301, as ‘he was wandering around with his ships’, O.03.302 (ἠλᾶτο ξὺν νηυϲί). Later, in <em>Odyssey</em> 4, we learn from the narrative of Menelaos that his sea voyage had reached not only Egypt but also other exotic places, including Cyprus and Phoenicia, O.04.083, even Libya, O.04.085. After experiencing all these adventures, he was still just ‘wandering around’ in an aimless way, O.04.081 and O.04.083 (ἐπαληθείϲ), O.04.091 (ἠλώμην). As Menelaos himself remarks, he spent eight years just wandering around, O.04.082.</p><p>[§99] Already in the narrative of Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3, the aimlessness of the sea voyage of Menelaos is anticipated: whereas Agamemnon got back home from Troy relatively soon, only to get killed by Aigisthos, Menelaos kept on wandering from one place to the next in his many sea voyages, and the word for his directionless maritime wanderings is <em>plazeto</em> ‘he was veering’, O.03.254 (πλάζετ’). Comparable, of course, are the even more extensive veerings of Odysseus in the overall Odyssey, as expressed by the same word <em>plazesthai</em> ‘veering’ already at the beginning of the epic: Odysseus is a hero ‘who veered [<em>plangthē</em>] in very many ways’, O.01.001–002 (ὃς μάλα πολλὰ | πλάγχθη). </p><p>[§100] So, where did all the veering begin for Menelaos? Where did his sea voyage start to go off course? According to one version of the myth about this hero’s travels by sea after Troy, as I will now argue, the veering can be traced all the way back to something that happened at Lesbos. I focus here on a detail we find in the tale told by Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3. In that tale, <em>Menelaos was late in arriving at Lesbos</em>. See the comment on O.03.168–169.</p>

# Odyssey 4.561-4.569

<p>Proteus makes a prophecy here, foretelling the immortalization of Menelaos in a <em>pedion</em> ‘field’ named <em>Ēlusion</em> ‘Elysium’, O.04.563. A comparable setting for immortalization is a place known as the <em>Makarōn nēsoi </em>‘Islands of the Blessed’ (as in Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 164–173). The name <em>Ēlusion</em> ‘Elysium’, as is evident from attestations outside of Homeric poetry, can refer to a mystical setting of immortalization as experienced by heroes worshipped in cult. From what evidence we have about hero cults, we can see that the rituals of worshipping heroes in cult places are ideologically synchronized with corresponding myths about the immortalization of these same heroes in paradise-like settings that are far removed from the everyday world. In fact, the forms <em>Ēlusion</em> &#x27;Elysium&#x27; and <em>Makarōn nēsoi</em> &#x27;Isles of the Blessed&#x27; are appropriate as names for actual cult sites. The proper noun <em>Ēlusion</em> coincides with the common noun <em>en-ēlúsion</em>, referring to a place made sacred by virtue of being struck by the thunderbolt (Pollux 9.41, etc.). The form <em>Ēlúsion</em> itself is glossed in the Alexandrian lexicographical tradition (Hesychius) as κεκεραυνωμένον χωρίον ἢ πεδίον ‘a place or field that has been struck by the thunderbolt&#x27;, with this added remark: καλεῖται δὲ καὶ ἐνηλύσια ‘and it is also called <em>enēlusia</em>’. As for <em>Makarōn nēsos</em> ‘Island of the Blessed’, there is a tradition that the name was actually applied to the old acropolis of Thebes, the Kadmeion; specifically, the name designated the sacred precinct where Semele, the mother of Dionysos, had been struck dead by the thunderbolt of Zeus (Parmenides via the Suda and via Photius, under <em>Makarōn nēsos</em>; Tzetzes on Lycophron 1194, 1204). We are immediately reminded of the poetic tradition that tells how Semele became immortalized as a direct result of dying from the thunderbolt of Zeus (see Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 2.25, in conjunction with Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 942). Inhabiting Elysium is the hero Rhadamanthys, O.04.564, who is described in this context as <em>xanthos</em> ‘with golden hair’. Similarly, Menelaos himself is conventionally described as <em>xanthos</em>: I.03.284, I.03.434, I.04.183, I.04.210, I.10.240, I.11.125, I.17.006, I.17.018, I.17.113, I.17.124, I.17.578, I.17.673, I.17.684, I.23.293, I.23.401, I.23.438, O.01.285, O.03.168, O.03.257, O.03.326, O.04.030, O.04.059, O.04.076, O.04.147, O.04.168, O.04.203, O.04.265, O.04.332, O.15.110, O.15.133, O.15.147. </p>

# Odyssey 4.687-695

<p>This speech by Penelope echoes the themes of those of Telemakhos and Mentor in O.2.63-79, O.2.229-241. When she asks her rhetorical question of whether the suitors listened to their parents tell of Odysseus, Penelope maintains, like Mentor, that it is ignorance or forgetfulness of Odysseus’ kindness as a ruler that explains the suitors’ arrogance. <em>ἀκούετε</em> (O.4.688), “you (pl.) hear,” here corresponds to a function of <em>mimnēskomai</em>, ‘remember’, when the latter denotes the performance of <em>klea andrōn</em>, epic songs about the glory of men: as <em>mimnēskomai</em> marks the activity of the bard, <em>akouō</em>, ‘hear’, is what the audience would do. The applicability of this constellation of concepts to the present passage is supported by Penelope’s insistence that Odysseus’ actions in the past were not only praiseworthy, but in fact also the subject of discourse – we can picture the suitors’ parents performing <em>klea andrōn</em>, specifically the <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus.</p><p>She also echoes Mentor, as well as Telemakhos, when she spells out that the suitors’ behavior is no fitting return for Odysseus’ treatment of his fellow men, and that the appropriate kind of reciprocation is manifestly not to be had (O.4.693-695). Where she differs from Mentor and Telemakhos, however, is in articulating the idea of reciprocity by using the term <em>kharis</em>, which here could be translated as ‘gratitude’, though its range of meanings is wider. In her speech, then, a connection is drawn between memory and reciprocity, specifically reciprocity denoted by <em>kharis </em>(see O.22.318-319 and my note there on the conventionality of the idea that good deeds deserve good <em>kharis </em>in return, and when that does not happen, the social system is being perverted).</p><p>Looking at how Telemakhos’, Mentor’s, and Penelope’s speeches converge on a topic but use different vocabulary to articulate what is involved makes apparent the connections between these key terms. We perceive the parallelism of <em>mēnis</em> and memory and their association with reciprocity in Telemakhos’ and Mentor’s speeches on the one hand, and the connection between memory and reciprocity denoted by <em>kharis </em>in particular in Penelope’s on the other. In addition, just as we can see that memory and <em>mēnis</em> are closely linked to <em>themis</em>, proper conduct, and upholding the cosmos (e.g. in Telemakhos’ speech in O.2), so the social role of <em>kharis</em>, especially as a force for or indication of proper social order (as in Penelope’s speech here), fits well in this network of concepts. Indeed, since the reciprocation of <em>kharites</em> (plural of <em>kharis</em>) is intended to establish a stable relationship with benefits to both parties, it appears to create an effect similar to that of the fear of <em>mēnis</em> or the positive guidance of memory. Just as <em>mēnis</em> and memory work to maintain the existing world order, so relationships of <em>kharis</em> are a further manifestation of the stability of the cosmos (see further O.24.281-286 and my note there on the connections between <em>kharis</em> and <em>themis</em>). Furthermore, a relationship of <em>kharis</em> involves memory (cp. e.g. dedications such as CEG 332 calling themselves <em>mnāma</em>), which can, in part, explain its similarity – or its kinship – to the purposes of <em>mēnis</em> and memory. The ideal of a remembering relationship of <em>kharis</em> as a manifestation of good behavior, however, is the opposite of what Penelope is talking about: in the scenario she describes, there is no <em>kharis</em>, no good conduct, and no memory of Odysseus. Compare Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 182-194 on the disruption of social order, proper reciprocal relationships and lack of <em>kharis</em>.</p><p>See further:</p><p>CEG = Hansen, P.

<p>Penelope’s prayer to Athena to save Telemakhos in return for the sacrifices Odysseus has made for the goddess is another example of the function of memory in the context of appropriate reciprocation, as seen with Telemakhos with Nestor (O.3.98-101) and Menelaus (O.4.328-331). This scene between Penelope and Athena offers a slight variation in that the addressee is a divinity and the earlier favor a sacrifice; however, the interrelation of memory and proper reciprocation remains the same, including the use of the formula, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι καί μοι… ‘remember them for me now and [do something] for me’ (O.4.765).</p>

<p>The rhapsody starts with the releasing of Odysseus by one goddess and ends with the mystical saving of his life by a second goddess, who is Leukotheā, the White Goddess. The beautiful Leukotheā saves Odysseus by undoing her hair and giving him as a life-saver the veil that had held her curls in place. As for the first goddess, who is Calypso, her action in releasing Odysseus from their mutual love affair becomes another life-saver for him. That is because the chances of success for such an affair between a mortal man and an immortal goddess would have been minimal, as we will see by observing other myths that tell about other such affairs. If the liaison of Odysseus with Calypso had continued, it is a certainty that he would have been killed off, just as Orion had died because of his liaison with Ēōs the goddess of the dawn.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Flaxman_goddess_1280.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Leucothea, the White Goddess, Preserving Ulysses” (1805).

<p>Only here in the <em>Odyssey</em> is the hero Tīthōnos ever mentioned, O.05.001. In the <em>Iliad</em>, there is a parallel mention of Tīthōnos at I.11.001. The wording of O.05.001–002 here matches the wording of I.11.001–002. The story of the abduction of Tīthōnos by Ēōs, goddess of dawn, is told at <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218–238. The liaison between the mortal man Tīthōnos and the immortal goddess Ēōs is parallel to the liaison between the mortal man Ankhises and the immortal goddess Aphrodite. And, as a result of both these affairs, the mortal man is permanently damaged: in the case of Tīthōnos, he loses his youth though he holds on to life. In the case of Ankhises, he is afflicted with some kind of paralysis. See the comment on <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218–238. The fact that Rhapsody 5 begins with a reference to an affair between a mortal man and an immortal goddess is relevant to the story of the affair between Odysseus and Calypso. </p>

<p>If Odysseus could read the stars correctly, he would see that the constellation of Orion shows him what would have happened if his liaison with Calypso had been prolonged: Odysseus too would have been killed off, like Orion. The astral configuration of Orion the Hunter and Arktos the Bear here at O.05.273–275 is pictured also at I.18.487–489. The stars in this configuration are re-enacting the myth of Orion: how Ēōs the goddess of dawn made Orion her lover and how Artemis the huntress then shot Orion with her arrows and killed him. The myth, as we have already seen, is narrated at O.05.121–124. A special point of interest in the description of Arktos the Bear at O.05.274—also at I.18.488—is the expression <em>dokeuei</em>: it appears that this she-bear is ‘taking aim’ at Orion. It can be argued that this pose of Arktos the she-bear reveals her to be a stand-in for the goddess Artemis herself at the moment when the goddess takes aim at Orion in order to shoot him dead with her arrows. It can also be argued that the dangerous liaison of Ēōs with Orion at O.05.121–124 is viewed as a relevant parallel to the liaison of Calypso with Odysseus.  </p>

# Odyssey 5.333-5.353

<p>Odysseus is saved from drowning by Ino, O.05.333, who was once a mortal woman but who has become immortalized after death by becoming the <em>Leukotheā</em> or ‘White Goddess’, O.05.334. The White Goddess gives to Odysseus her <em>krēdemnon</em>, that is, her headdress or ‘veil’, which becomes his life-saver: O.05.346, O.05.351, O.05.373, O.05.459. In order to give the hero her headdress, she would first have to undo her hair, as we can see by comparing the scene where Andromache lets fall from her head her own headdress, the word for which is, here again, <em>krēdemnon</em>, I.22.470. See the commentary on I.22.460–474, where I noted that the undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I called an <em>Aphrodisiac effect</em>. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon </em>is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. Also, while saving the hero, the goddess assumes the form of a diving bird called <em>aithuia</em>, O.05.337 and O.05.353. These actions of Ino in saving Odysseus from the mortal dangers of the sea are parallel to the actions of the goddess Athena herself. [What follows is epitomized from Nagy 1985:80–81 (= §78).] Ino as <em>aithuia</em> has a parallel agent in ensuring the salvation of Odysseus from the sea: Athena herself redirects the storm sent against the hero by Poseidon, O.05.382–387, and then she saves him from immediate drowning by giving him a timely idea for swimming to safety, O.05.435–439. The hero submerges but then emerges from a wave that would surely have drowned him had it not been for Athena, O.05.435 and O.05.438, and this detail corresponds closely to the preceding emergence and submergence of Ino herself, O.05.337 and O.05.352–353. Such a correspondence suggests that Ino, the former mortal who is now a goddess, O.05.334 and O.05.335, is a model for a transition from death to life anew. </p>

<p>Nausicaa, princess of the Phaeacians, makes her appearance as a potential but unattainable love-interest for Odysseus—and as a delight for all who find themselves irresistibly drawn into the story of her girlish but principled encounter with the enthralled hero.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1878_Frederick_Leighton_-_Nausicaa_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Nausicaa” (1878), Frederick Leighton (English, 1830–1896).<br/><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3A1878_Frederick_Leighton_-_Nausicaa.jpg">Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p><p></p><p>This Rhapsody belongs to Nausicaa. I spell her name in its familiar latinized form, with a <em>c</em>, since her fame extends far beyond the ancient Greek world, where she appears as Ναυσικάα. In any case, the name has a certain primacy of place. I have no idea who said it first, but I first heard it from the long-departed Sterling Dow in the early 1960s: if you look up all surviving ancient Greek names in reverse alphabetical order, the first one you see is Nausicaa = Ναυσικάα, while the very last of them all is Calypso = Καλυψώ. Surely we see here a coincidence, not some mysterious signal emanating from some grand cosmic plan, but the coincidence itself seems just as lovely as Nausicaa is lovely. Some critics view her as a youthful love-interest for Odysseus, matching Calypso as the hero’s divine love-interest. But such a view detracts from the loveliness: Nausicaa is meant to be a love-interest for all who hear her story—just as Calypso is a universal love-interest in her own story as told in Rhapsody 5. In the story of Nausicaa as told in Rhapsody 6, she is pictured as the perfect bride for any man fortunate enough to succeed in marrying her—and she knows it. The self-awareness of Nausicaa is shaped by the poetry that idealizes her eligibility by animating her beauty and her charm to the point where she becomes comparable to the goddess Artemis. Odysseus himself initiates the comparison and, by comparing the girl to the goddess, he is signaling to himself that Nausicaa, even if she does not know it yet, is for him enticingly unattainable.</p>

# Odyssey 6.100-101

<p>At O.06.085–099, Nausicaa and the girls who attend her are at the banks of a river, washing the clothes they have brought from the palace, and then waiting for the wet clothes to dry in the sun; while they wait, they clean up and enjoy each other’s company as they indulge in a picnic. Next, at O.06.100–101, after having finished eating and drinking, they start playfully singing and dancing with each other: the playfulness of the song and dance is expressed by the verb <em>paizein</em> ‘play’ at O.06.100, while the actual singing /dancing is expressed by the noun <em>molpē</em> ‘singing and dancing’ at O.06.101. The prima donna / prima ballerina of the singing / dancing is Nausicaa herself, as expressed by the verb <em>arkhesthai </em>‘lead off [in performing]’, again at O.06.101. The dancing in this case includes the playful tossing of a <em>sphaira</em> ‘ball’, O.06.100. While the girls are feeling all freed up in their playfulness, they throw off the <em>krēdemna</em> or ‘veils’ that they are wearing. So, now we can see that Nausicaa and the girls who attend her would not even think of going out in public without first putting on their <em>krēdemna</em> ‘veils’. They won’t leave home without wearing their headdresses. But now they are no longer in public—or so they imagine. The detail about wearing a veil when the girls leave home and go outdoors is hardly a signal of their being married. Clearly, all these girls are unmarried. So, we see here that unmarried women as well as married women like Andromache wear the <em>krēdemnon </em>in public. The custom is simply a signal of propriety. On the function of the <em>krēdemnon</em> ‘headdress’ as an equivalent of a ‘veil’, I recommend the work of Levine 1995 (especially pp. 96–110), who shows that the custom of wearing a veil is part of a “cultural grammar of hair” (Levine p. 95). Relevant are my comments about O.05.333–353 with reference to Ino the White Goddess and, earlier, about I.22.460–474 with reference to Andromache. In both sets of comments, I noted that the undoing of a woman’s hair, caused by the undoing of her <em>krēdemnon</em>, produces what I called an <em>Aphrodisiac effect</em>. So long as a woman’s <em>krēdemnon </em>is in place, her sexuality is under control just as her hair is under control. When the <em>krēdemnon</em> is out of place, however, her sexuality threatens to get out of control. But there is even more to it. When a woman or girl is indoors instead of outdoors, in public, then, while indoors, the sexuality is under control—so long as the vision of the woman or girl with hair undone is private. But what happens when the undoing of the hair is represented in the verbal arts or visual arts? Then the view becomes public and even voyeuristic.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/430082001_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Red-figured pyxis, picturing Nereids at home, “indoors”: the Nereid with her hair down is labeled as Thaleia.<br/><u><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?assetId=195427001&amp;objectId=400084&amp;partId=1">Image</a></u> via The British Museum.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, there is something voyeuristic about the representation of Nausicaa and the girls who attend her as they sing and dance without wearing their veils: they imagine they are in a private place, but the medium of verbal art is watching them, making their performance public.

The <em>phoinix</em> is also mentioned in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 18 and 117. Odysseus claims to have seen this date palm with his own eyes when he visited Delos, O.06.163–165. This mention of Delos is a rare Homeric reference to locales that are distinctly Ionian in culture (HPC 227). Also, we see epic distancing here (Taplin 1996): back in the age of heroes, the date palm was still young and small, O.06.166–168—much smaller than it is imagined to be in the post-heroic age. </p>

# name of goddess X, name of place X ruled by goddess X

<p>The name <em>Athḗnē</em> applies both to the goddess known in English as ‘Athena’, as at <em>Odyssey</em> 7.78, and to the place that is seen as the possession of the goddess—which is the territory of the place known in English as ‘Athens’, as at <em>Odyssey</em> 7.80.<a href="x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> The suffix <em>-ḗnē</em> is visible also in the name of the nymph <em>Mukḗnē</em>, who presides over the acropolis of Mycenae.<a href="x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The same suffix <em>-ḗnē</em> is visible also in the place-name <em>Messḗnē</em>, which means something like ‘Midland’.<a href="x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Here I compare the place-name <em>me-za-na</em> written on a Linear B tablet from Pylos, Cn 3.1. On the basis of this comparison, I have observed: “I suspect that the suffix <em>-ḗnē</em> is endowed with an elliptic function.”<a href="x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> What I meant is this: a form that is elliptic refers not only to X but also to everything that belongs to X, such as X2, X3, X4 etc. An elliptic form of X implies X2, X3, X4 etc. without naming X2, X3, X4 etc. explicitly. In terms of this definition, the name <em>Athḗnē</em> refers not only to the goddess ‘Athena’ but also to everything that belongs to the goddess. The primary example of that ‘everything’ in this context is the acropolis of Athens. And we see another level of ellipsis in the plural form <em>Athênai</em>: this elliptic plural refers not only to the acropolis of Athens but also to everything that belongs to the acropolis of Athens, which is the city of Athens, and, by extension, to everything that belongs to the city, which is ultimately the region of Attica.<a href="x-webdoc://02EEC853-5C1F-4478-8173-E7660B646557/#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>I see a parallel situation in the use of the form <em>Aswia</em> (/<em>Aswiās</em>) in the Linear B texts, where Aswia is evidently a goddess, as we see from the collocation <em>po-ti-ni-ja a-si-wi-ja</em> = <em>potnia Aswia</em> ‘[Our] Lady Aswia’ as written on a tablet from Pylos, Fr 1208. In the case of Aswia, the name survives into the classical period of recorded texts in the fifth century BCE and later: now the name is pronounced <em>Asíā</em>, meaning ‘Asia’, and the referent here is what we call ‘Asia Minor’ in English. So, from a diachronic perspective, this name applies both to the goddess and to the realm of the goddess. She is ‘Our Lady of Asia’ or ‘Asia’ personified.</p>
<p>I emphasize here that the form <em>Athḗnē</em> at line 80 of <em>Odyssey</em> 7 is the only instance, in all surviving texts ever written in the ancient Greek language, where the name of  the place ‘Athens’ is found in the singular, not in the plural. Everywhere else in attested Greek, we read the elliptic plural <em>Athênai</em>, which I now interpret to mean ‘everything that belongs to the acropolis of <em>Athḗnē</em>’. And there is also a deeper level of ellipsis here: the suffix <em>-ḗnē</em> of <em>Athḗnē</em> indicates that the goddess Athena is also a personification of the place of Athena, which is the acropolis of Athens and, by extension, the city of Athens, and by further extension, everything that belongs to the city of Athens.</p>

# Odyssey 7.81-7.132

<p>The palace of Alkinoos, described at O.07.081–111, is comparable to the heavenly residence of Menelaos. See the comment at O.04.043–075. I now argue here that the garden of Alkinoos, described at O.07.112–132, is likewise presented as a heavenly place. At O.07.103–130, where we see verses that overlap the descriptions of the palace and the garden, we find that the describing verbs avoid the past tense. The descriptions are restricted to the present tense. It has been argued that a textual interpolation has happened here (West 2000:480), on the grounds that Homeric diction does not use the present tense to indicate the past, and that only those aspects of the past that are viewed as permanent can be described in the present tense: examples include the chariot of Hera, I.05.724–728; the abode of Poseidon under the sea at Aigai, I.13.021–022; the springs of the river Scamander, I.22.147–154; the harbor and cave of the Nymphs at Ithaca, O.13.096–112; and, most important for my argumentation here, the dwelling-place of the gods on Mount Olympus, O.06.043–046. Arguing against the theory of interpolation, I propose that not only the palace of Alkinoos but also his garden are modeled on an idealized and thus heavenly prototype. Both the palace and the garden are models of permanence. In the case of the palace, its permanence is actually made explicit in a reference at O.07.091–094 to golden and silver watchdogs that guard the palace and that are made to last forever by the divine smith Hephaistos. The aura of this beautiful place is not only enchanting but even enchanted. In terms of my argument, then, there is no need to posit (as does West 2000:483–486) a textual interpolation from an unattested passage that would have followed what is spoken by Nausicaa at O.06.255–303 with reference to the palace of Alkinoos and its environs. The present tenses that are used in descriptions of the palace and the garden at O.07.081–111 and 112–132 respectively are appropriate to the heavenly aura of the whole place.</p>

# Odyssey 7.256/ Anchor Comment on: endukéōs 'continuously, uninterruptedly'

<p>This adverb <em>endukéōs </em>‘continuously, uninterruptedly’ expresses the idea of an uninterrupted sequence. The opposite of this adverb <em>endukéōs</em> ‘continuously, uninterruptedly’can be seen in the adjective <em>adeukḗs</em>, which can be interpreted as ‘discontinuous, interrupting’. See the anchor comment at O.04.489. In terms of this interpretation, the root <em>duk-/deuk-</em> for this adverb/adjective conveys the sense of ‘continue’. </p>

# Odyssey 7.321

<p>The Ionian island of Euboea is ostentatiously described as very far away from the island of the Phaeacians. The point of this description may be related to the poetic agenda of the <em>Odyssey</em> in describing the kingdom of the Phaeacians as a mythological replica of the confederation known as the Ionian Dodecapolis as it existed around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405.) For a reconstruction of the poetic agenda originating from the Ionian Dodecapolis around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE, I recommend the analysis of Frame 2009 ch. 7. (As for a relatively later phase of the poetic agenda, where the kingdom of Alkinoos is reshaped as a mythological replica of the island-state of Kerkyra / Corcyra, I refer to my initial comments on Rhapsody 7 of the <em>Odyssey</em>, where I cross-refer to my further comments on Rhapsody 11.) From the standpoint of Ionian Dodecapolis, dominated by the city-state of Miletus in Asia Minor, the island of Euboea was situated far away to the west. The territory of Euboea was shared by two rival Ionian cities, Eretria and Khalkis, and the first of the two was a close ally of Miletus. The distancing of the Ionian Dodecapolis from Ionian Euboea could be explained as a playfully ostentatious reference to the far reach of East Greeks in dealing with West Greeks. </p>

# Odyssey 8.026-045

<p>Alkinoos the king is addressing his subjects, the Phaeacians, and he speaks of the ‘escort’ that he plans to provide for the stranger who has not yet identified himself as Odysseus. The word that I translate as ‘escort’ here is <em>pompē</em>: O.08.030, O.08.031, O.08.033. And the word that I translate as ‘stranger’ is <em>xenos</em>: O.08.028. Alkinoos intends to be a host to this stranger, treating him as a ‘guest’, and the word that I translate as ‘guest’ here is likewise <em>xenos</em>, O.08.042. What Alkinoos plans to offer his guest is a <em>dais</em>, which refers on the surface to a ‘feast’. The feast will evidently include a dinner, O.08.042, and this dinner will include entertainment in the form of ‘singing’, the noun for which is <em>aoidē</em> at O.08.044 and the verb for which is <em>aeidein</em> at O.08.045. The one who will be singing is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’, O.08.043, whose name is Demodokos, O.08.044.

# Odyssey 8.44

<p>The &quot;speaking name&quot; (nomen loquens) of the singer, <em>Dēmódokos</em>, can be interpreted as meaning ‘one who is received [verb <em>dek(h)esthai</em>] by the community [<em>dēmos</em>]’, and, in the present context, the <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ that gives to the singer’s singing its reception is indicated at O.08.036: that community is the <em>dēmos</em> or ‘district’ of the kingdom ruled by Alkinoos the king. I translate <em>Dēmódokos</em> as ‘received <em>by</em> the community’, not just ‘received <em>in</em> the community’, because the noun <em>dēmos</em> implies an authority that is endowed with agency: the <em>dēmos</em> can perform a function, such as the reception of a song. We can see such agency at work in the use of the word <em>dāmos</em> (da-mo) in the Linear B tablet Ep 704 from Pylos: in the litigation that is described in that text, the <em>dāmos</em> literally speaks as one of the two parties engaged in the litigation over land-tenure: <em>dāmos de min phāsi … ekheen </em>(da-mo-de-mi-pa-si … e-ke-e) ‘but the <em>dāmos</em> says [<em>phāsi</em>] that she [= the priestess] has …’ (HR 75–76). </p>

# Odyssey 8.61

<p>[Epitomized from MoM 4§73:] The noun <em>dais </em>‘feast’, as we see it used here at O.08.061, is derived from the verb <em>daiesthai</em> in the basic sense of ‘distribute ’, which is used in contexts of animal sacrifice in referring to the ‘distribution’ of cooked meat among the members of a community, as at O.15.140 and O.17.332. Then, by way of synecdoche, the specific idea of <em>distribution</em> extends metonymically to the general idea of <em>feasting</em> and further to the even more general idea of a <em>festival</em>. Following the logic of this sequence of meanings, we see that the animal sacrifice at O.08.059 had led to the cooking and the distribution of the meat, O.08.061, which will lead to communal dining, O.08.071–072, which will lead to the First Song of Demodokos, O.08.073–083, and so on. On <em>metonymy</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. In terms of this logic, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> in the sense of ‘feast’ here at O.08.061 marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals: animal sacrifice, communal feasting, singing as well as dancing at the feast. As we will see in comments that follow, this <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ as signaled at O.08.061 will be rethought as a stylized festival, centering on a sacrifice that leads to a division of meat at the feast. Such a festival will continue from here in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 all the way to the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 13.</p>

# Odyssey 8.062-095

<p>Demodokos is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer,’ O.08.062, and he is is blind, O.08.63–64. The song that he sings about the Trojan War, O.08.073–082, prompts Odysseus to break down in tears and weep, O.08.083–095. Every time the singer ‘leaves off’ singing, as indicated by <em>lēgein</em>, O.08.087, he then restarts his song, as indicated by <em>aps arkhesthai</em>, O.08.090, since his Phaeacian listeners ‘feel delight’, as indicated by the verb <em>terpesthai</em>, as they hear his singing, O.08.091. So, the listeners of Demodokos so enjoy his singing that they don’t let him stop. (See the comments at HC 2§299 and 2§343.) There is a contradiction here between the reactions of Odysseus and the other listeners. Every time the singer restarts his singing, Odysseus restarts his weeping, O.08.092. But Odysseus pretends to be enjoying the performance of Demodokos, O.08.089, and he manages to evade the notice of all the Phaeacians, O.08.093—except for Alkinoos, O.08.094–095. As I will argue with reference to the Third Song of Demodokos, that song can be interpreted as a restarting of the First Song of Demodokos—followed by a parallel restarting of the tears of Odysseus in response to it.  </p>

<p>The expression <em>aristoi Akhaiōn</em> (ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν) at verse 78, which I translate as ‘the best of the Achaeans’, here is in the plural, and nowhere else in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em> do we find such a plural (for a different, distributive plural by implication of this same expression 'best of the Achaeans', see my note on <a href="/commentary?wordpressId=166668">Iliad 8.228-235</a>). Rather, we find the singular <em>aristos Akhaiōn</em> (ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν), which I again translate as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. Although many heroes contend for this title in the macro-epic of the <em>Iliad</em>, only one of them, Achilles, emerges as eligible to be known in that epic as the absolute best of all the Achaeans, by contrast with such rivals as Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Ajax. Similarly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, only Odysseus emerges as the absolute best, by contrast with the suitors of Penelope. So, in terms of both these two macro-epics, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, there can only be one hero who is truly ‘the best of the Achaeans’.</p>

<p>At O.08.073–082, we see the plot of the First Song—at least, the plot of the start of the First Song. We cannot be sure about the whole plot because the singer more than once ‘leaves off’ his song, as signaled by <em>lēgein</em> at O.08.087, and then ‘restarts’ it, as signaled by <em>aps arkhesthai</em> at O.08.090. The multiple restartings are prompted by the fact that the singer’s Phaeacian listeners ‘feel delight’, as indicated by the verb <em>terpesthai</em>, as they hear his singing, O.08.091, and they want to hear more. As I noted in my comment for O.08.062–095, even Odysseus pretends to be enjoying the performance of Demodokos, O.08.089.

# Odyssey 8.074

<p>I translate the genitive of <em>oimē</em> (οἴμης) here as ‘starting (from a story-thread)’. (See also PP 63, HC 2§92n.) The paraphrasing here of the song of Demodokos recapitulates the <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium, prelude’ of the song. [What follows is epitomized from HC 2§§92–93:] In the case of the compound noun <em>prooimion</em> / προοίμιον, conventionally translated as ‘proemium’, the element -<em>oim</em>- / -οιμ- is derived from a root that we find also attested in two simple nouns, <em>oimos</em> / οἶμος and <em>oimē</em> / οἰμή. The Attic by-form of <em>prooimion</em> / προοίμιον, which is <em>phroimion</em> / φροίμιον, elucidates the prehistory of the root: we must reconstruct it not as *<em>oim</em>- but as *<em>hoim</em>-, from *<em>soim</em>-. This reconstruction helps elucidate the surviving contexts of both <em>oimos</em> / οἶμος and <em>oimē</em> / οἰμή, which do not always give a clear picture of the basic meaning of either form. In some contexts, the meaning seems to be ‘song’, as here at O.08.074, while in others it seems to be ‘way, pathway’, as in Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 290. With the help of comparative evidence, however, the primary meaning of <em>oimos</em> and <em>oimē</em> can be reconstructed as ‘thread, threading’, and the meanings ‘song’ or ‘way, pathway’ can be explained as secondary: that is, ‘song’ and ‘way, pathway’ are metaphorical generalizations derived from the meaning ‘thread, threading’ (PR 72, 81; also PP 63n20). And it is such a primary meaning ‘thread, threading’ that we find in comparable forms attested in other Indo-European languages: for example, the form *<em>soimos</em> that we reconstruct from Greek <em>oimos</em> is attested as Old Icelandic <em>seimr</em>, meaning ‘thread’ (for this and other examples, see Durante 1976:176). In terms of such a primary meaning, the etymology of the compound noun <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium’ can be interpreted as a metaphor referring to the ‘initial threading’ of a song. A close semantic parallel to the etymology of Greek <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium’ as an ‘initial threading’ of a song is the etymology of Latin <em>exordium</em>, which likewise means ‘proemium’ in poetic and rhetorical contexts: the meaning of this noun as well can be traced back to the basic idea of an ‘initial threading’ (PP 63n20). The poetic and rhetorical concepts of both Greek <em>prooimion</em> and Latin <em>exordium</em> in the sense of ‘proemium’ have a common Indo-European ancestry. As I will argue later, not only <em>oimos</em> / <em>oimē</em> / <em>prooimion</em> but also <em>humnos</em>, ordinarily translated as ‘hymn’, are derived from roots that refer to the making of fabric. Moreover, I note that the word <em>oimos</em> is formulaically interchangeable with the word <em>humnos</em> at verse 451 of the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (4) <em>to Hermes</em>, where we see the attestation of both οἶμος ἀοιδῆς and ὕμνος ἀοιδῆς in the manuscript tradition; at a later point, we will also consider the cognate expression ἀοιδῆς ὕμνον at verse 429 of <em>Odyssey</em> 8. I interpret the combinations of <em>humnos</em> and <em>oimos</em> with <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ to mean respectively the ‘weaving’ of song and the ‘threading’ of song. Relevant to this interpretation is the context of <em>oimē</em> at verse 74 of <em>Odyssey</em> 8: we see here a metaphorical reference to the initial part of performing a song, that is, to the ‘initial threading’ of a song. To sum up, the meaning of <em>oimos</em> or <em>oimē</em> as ‘song’ results from a metaphorical extension: the idea of <em>making song</em> is being expressed metaphorically through the idea of <em>making fabric</em>. As for contexts where <em>oimos</em> and <em>oimē</em> seem to mean ‘way, pathway’, I argue that such a meaning is likewise a result of metaphorical extension: here the general idea of <em>moving ahead</em> from one point to another is being expressed metaphorically by applying the specific idea of <em>threading one’s way</em> from one point to another (more on this point at HC 2§311, in the excursus there). On points of comparison with the proemium that introduces the <em>History</em> of Herodotus, see PH 221.  </p>

# Odyssey 8.75-78

<p>The narrative subject of the epic that is being paraphrased here is a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ between Odysseus and Achilles, O.08.075. And the setting for this quarrel is a <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ that is explicitly correlated with a ‘sacrifice’, O.08.076: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a celebratory feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. The same epithet <em>thaleiēi</em> (θαλείῃ) is also used to describe the ongoing <em>dais </em>‘feast’ at O.08.099. This epithet is of special interest in light of the meaning of the noun <em>thaliai</em> in the plural, ‘celebrations, festivities’, as at O.11.603 (HPC 85n13). We may compare another feast, described at I.08.228–235, where the describer is Agamemnon, recalling a scene from the collective past of the Achaeans: the setting of this other feast was the island of Lemnos, and each one of the Achaean leaders took turns in boasting that he was the best Achaean of them all, I.08.229. In my comment on I.08.228–235, I noted that the noun <em>eukhōlai</em> ‘boastings’ in the plural at I.08.229 indicates a distributive action: the Achaeans were boasting not as a group but individually and competitively. The competitive boasting evidently centered on the question: who would be superior to all others in performing heroic exploits in the upcoming Trojan War? And the setting for this quarrel was a feast where the meat of oxen to be eaten in vast quantities was being apportioned among the Achaean leaders, I.08.231. Since the narrative here makes a point of adding that these leaders were also drinking wine, I.08.232, it is implied that all the boasting could get out of hand and lead to quarrels about the awarding of prime cuts of meat. It would have been expected that the best portion of meat should go to the best hero. On the idea of a champion’s portion of meat, see the comment on I.07.319–322. Having reconstructed for I.08.228–235 a scene of quarreling in the context of apportioning cuts of meat, I return to the scene at O.08.075–078, where we see once again a scene of quarreling in the context of apportioning cuts of meat. And here the ‘quarreling’ is explicitly called a <em>neikos</em>, O.08.075, while the ‘apportioning of meat’ is explicitly called a <em>dais</em>, O.08.076. As we saw in the comment for I.01.423–425, a <em>dais</em> is a feast where meat is distributed, and this meat comes from the sacrifice of sacrificial animals. Thus the act of sacrifice converts the feast of humans into a notional feast of the gods. This notion, ‘feast of the gods’, is made explicit at O.08.076, where the setting is described explicitly this way, as we have already seen: θεῶν ἐν δαιτὶ θαλείῃ ‘at a celebratory feast [<em>dais</em>] of the gods’. In this festive setting, as I already highlighted in the comment on I.08.228–235, the <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075 is between Odysseus and Achilles, who are described at O.08.078 as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. In terms of such a dispute in the context of a feast, each one of the two heroes would be claiming to be the ‘best of the Achaeans’. Achilles would have claimed to be ‘best’ because of his superior <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’, while Odysseus would have counter-claimed to be ‘best’ because of his superior <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’. See the comments on O.01.002; see also, further back, the comments on I.01.001–012, where I argue that the quarrel between Odysseus and Achilles came from an epic tradition that was independent from the epic tradition that featured the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles. Further, see the comment on I.09.346–352, where I note that this Iliadic passage was thought by Aristarchus (scholia A for I.09.347) to be an allusion to the quarrel at O.08.075–078 between Achilles and Odysseus over one overriding question: will Troy be conquered by relying on the physical power of Achilles or on the mental power of Odysseus? </p>

<p>Agamemnon misunderstands the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, which had evidently prophesied to him that Troy would be captured when the ‘best of the Achaeans’—Odysseus and Achilles—engage in a quarrel at a feast. Agamemnon rejoices when he sees the two heroes quarreling, since he thinks that victory over the Trojans will be quick and easy—and painless. But the war will be a great <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’, O.08.081, for the Achaeans as also for the Trojans, O.08.082. This pain is compared to a breakaway boulder that ‘rolls’ down from the heights above, as expressed by way of <em>kulindesthai</em>, O.08.081, and this boulder will crush anyone that stands in its way. And all that pain will be caused by the Will of Zeus, O.08.082. For another comparable misunderstanding on the part of Agamemnon, see the comments on I.02.007–015 and on I.02.036–040. </p>

<p>The epic singing of the first song of Demodokos in <em>Odyssey</em> 8, once it gets started by the <em>prooimion</em> as indicated by the syntax at verse 74, keeps getting restarted. Whenever the performer ‘leaves off’, as indicated by the word <em>lēgein</em> at verse 87, he keeps on ‘restarting’ the epic, as indicated by the wording <em>aps arkhesthai</em> ‘start again and again’ at verse 90. The continual restarting creates the effect of an endless narrative: the epic performance of the first song of Demodokos seems to have no end in sight.</p>

# Odyssey 8.171-173

<p>This passage, beginning with the expression <em>ho d'asphaleōs agoreuei</em> 'he speaks to the point unfailingly'  is remarkably similar, even word-for-word the same, as what the poet Hesiod says in <em>Theogony</em> lines 86 and 91-92  in describing the gift of fair speech which the Muses give to a king when they honor him from birth. The difference is that Hesiod names the context—kings—whereas Odysseus does not, but the reason for this is clear: for Odysseus to do so would require him to identify himself before his dramatic self-disclosure in Book 9. Once the reason for Odysseus’s silence, namely his still hidden identity, is taken into account, the context of the two passages is the same, namely fair speech as the essential quality of a king.</p><p>The close correspondence in phrasing between the two passages has raised the question whether one passage imitates the other, but no consensus has ever been reached. The answer seems to lie not in the imitation of one poet by the other, but in a common poetic tradition behind both poets. This tradition has been identified in a perceptive study by Richard Martin as “the instruction of princes,” a wide-spread genre with important examples in Greek, from Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days</em> and the poetry of Theognis, to the lost <em>Instructions of Chiron</em>. The Hesiodic passage fills in for us what is deliberately withheld in Odysseus’s speech, namely that <em>he is speaking about what it is to be a king.</em> The Homeric audience would have understood this, because they, like us, knew that the speaker is not only a king, but, in the Homeric scheme of things, the ideal king. </p><p>This is only half the story, however. When Odysseus delivers his piece of princely instruction, he does more than hint at his own identity. He also brings the Homeric audience into the story through a more subtle case of hidden identity than his own. In spite of surface appearances the intended recipient of Odysseus’s instruction is not in fact the young Phaeacian to whom it is overtly addressed: his name, Euryalos, which relates to the sea, does not distinguish him from the other Phaeacians, twenty-one of whom have similar sea-related names. That name is generic, a reflection of the Phaeacians’ mythic function as sea-farers. Odysseus does indeed reprove Euryalos at the start of his speech, saying “you are like a reckless man,” and again at the end, where he acknowledges Euryalos’s fine physical appearance, but censures his lack of understanding (<em>noos</em>). However, the burden of Odysseus’s speech is not this reproof, but a positive portrayal of fair speech and its salutary effects.</p><p>The figure who stands most to benefit from this positive instruction is not Euryalos, but the future king of the Phaeacians, who is part of the whole episode from the start. It is Laodamas, the favorite son and heir apparent of king Alcinous, who first sets the episode in motion by inviting—indeed challenging—Odysseus to participate in contests (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.131-151), an invitation which Odysseus turns down with some asperity (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.152-157). This occasions Euryalos’s ill-considered words to Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.158-164) and Odysseus’s response. But if Laodamas is the intended recipient of Odysseus’s instruction, why is he not presented as such, but instead kept far enough from the hero’s display of mettle to escape notice entirely? Odysseus himself provides one answer after his mighty rock toss, when he challenges all the Phaeacian youths to compete with him in further contests but excepts Laodamas from his challenge: only a fool would compete with his host, and Odysseus will not do that(Odyssey 8.204-208). This prudent respect for a host can be seen as present in the prior situation as well, in which Euryalos draws a reproof that all but touches Laodamas, but does not in fact touch him.</p><p>Now Laodamas' name, which means “he who controls the people,” is well suited to a future king, but that is not its real significance, or not all of it. The last Neleid king of Miletus had this name—<em>Leōdamas</em> in its Ionic form—and, while dates are uncertain, this Leōdamas can easily be placed in the Homeric era. Leōdamas is a good candidate to have been the prime mover of Panionian unity in the late eighth and early seventh century BC. We are fortunate indeed to know something of this Leoōamas beyond his name. His memory has been preserved in fragments of two historians of the Roman era. Leōdamas was successful in a foreign war which benefited Miletus and confirmed him as king, and as king he went on to become much loved by his people. His story ended tragically when he was murdered by a rival for the kingship, and this brought kingship itself to an end in Miletus.</p><p>Now the Ionian Greeks of Asia Minor traced their pre-migration origins back to the Bronze Age city of Pylos and its legendary founder, king Neleus. More precisely, the royal family of the Ionian city of Miletus traced their origins back to king Neleus, and they were therefore called <em>Neleidai</em>, “descendants of Neleus.” These Neleids then extended their pedigree to other Ionian cities in the process of forming a greater Ionian community, the so-called Ionian dodecapolis. This union of twelve cities, meeting at its cult center Panionion, gave rise to the two Homeric epics as part of the process of Ionian community formation. It is this Ionian community, as it met at Panionion, that the Phaeacians represent.</p><p>In Homer it is not Neleus himself but his son Nestor who plays a great role. It is he who represents the earliest stage in the picture of a common Panionian origin. Alcinous, the Phaeacian king, is a second Nestor, a conscious duplication of the Pylian king. Athena reveals this when she disguises herself as a maiden and meets Odysseus on his way to the Phaeacian palace (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.19-81) . She tells Odysseus about the king and queen he is about to meet inside the palace, and for the king she gives a genealogy extending over four generations, which is in effect Nestor’s genealogy: the names are different but the genealogy’s intricate structure is the same. By her action Athena also identifies the queen, Arete, as a second stage in the picture of a common Panionian origin when she leaves Odysseus and flies to Athens and enters the royal palace, her place of worship. The Neleids were said to have migrated from Pylos to Athens at the end of the Bronze Age, where they became the ruling family; Arete, who is cast in the mold of the Athenian city-goddess, Athena Polias, represents this second stage. It was from Athens that the Neleids next founded Miletus and became its ruling family: the founder of Miletus was named Neleus like his Pylian ancestor, and this gave the Neleid kings of Miletus two ancestors to explain their name.</p><p>When Odysseus gives princely instruction in Book 8 of the <em>Odyssey</em>, identifying fair speech as the essential quality of a king, the instruction is really addressed not to his apparent interlocutor, a misbehaved youth, but to a future king who stands by unnoticed. This future king in turn represents an actual king, ruling in the Homeric present. The Phaeacian Laodamas has as yet done nothing to distinguish himself except behave properly to a stranger. He is all future potential. That potential, we are meant to understand, has now been fulfilled in the actual present. The king who rules now is fictively pictured as having been present to hear the ideal king discourse on what it is to be a king. He has heard the lesson of the past—the heroic past—from the very hero of the poem. The Homeric audience is equally honored in this because like their king they also are like the Phaeacians, since they are also listeners to Odysseus' discourse, and as such they also have received the lessons of the heroic past from the hero’s own mouth. </p><p>Bibliographical references</p><p>Douglas Frame, "New Light on the Homeric Question: the Phaeacians Unmasked,” <a href="http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4453">http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/4453</a>.  For more details on the argument excerpted above, see this article.</p><p>Douglas Frame, "Odysseus and Kingship: Commentary on <em>Odyssey</em> 8.166-177," Classical Inquiries, June 3, 2016, <a href="http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/odysseus-and-kingship-commentary-on-odyssey-8-166-177">http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/odysseus-and-kingship-commentary-on-odyssey-8-166-177</a>.

Such a choral event is an<em> agōn</em> ‘competition’, just like the athletic events that preceded. So, all these events are seen as a festive continuum. </p>

# Odyssey 8.261-8.265

<p>Acrobatic dancers lead off the choral singing and dancing, and the <em>khoros</em> or ‘place for choral singing-and-dancing’ becomes their dancing floor. This pattern of leading off resembles the pattern we see in versions of Ο.04.019 and Ι.18.606 where we see the variant reading ἐξάρχοντες instead of ἐξάρχοντος. In terms of this reading, the acrobatic dancers lead off, starting their performance before the singer starts. </p>

# Odyssey 8.266–272

<p>This passage describing the coordinated fighting method of the half-brothers Ajax and Teucer may depict a very old style of battle, and connects the identities of the two brothers in an ancient, perhaps even Indo-European, mythic way (Ebbott 2003:41–44). The brief simile comparing Teucer running behind Ajax’s shield in between shots to a child hiding behind his mother (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.271) creates several powerful associations. Teucer’s illegitimacy is highlighted by his comparison to the child, since a “bastard” (<em>nothos</em>) could be imagined as a perpetual child in Greek myth and poetry (Ebbott 2003:31–40). The comparison of Ajax to the mother, moreover, highlights the emotional bonds between warriors: mother similes in the <em>Iliad</em> signify the care, love, and protection that comrades on the battlefield extend to one another (Casey and Ebbott 2012).</p>

# Odyssey 8.267

<p>The subject of the song is the <em>philotēs</em> ‘sexual bonding’ of Ares and Aphrodite. The adulterous lovers will be caught in the act by the husband of Aphrodite, Hephaistos. The introduction of the story by way of the preposition <em>amphi</em> ‘about’ is typical of hymns. The story of the sexual encounter of Ares and Aphrodite is typical of a genre known as <em>divine burlesque</em>, on which see the comment on I.21.385–514. The subject of such a <em>philotēs</em> ‘sexual bonding’ is treated seriously by Empedocles DK B 35. </p>

# Odyssey 8.390-391

<p>Alkinoos says that the kingdom of the Phaeacians, described here as a <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’, is ruled by twelve <em>basilēes</em> ‘kings’, O.08.390, and that he counts himself as the thirteenth. (On <em>krainein</em> in the sense of ‘authorize’ and thereby ‘rule’, see GMP 59.) In terms of this description, Alkinoos figures himself as an over-king, and maybe the word <em>basilēes</em> here has the meaning of ‘sub-kings’—which is in fact the meaning of the corresponding word <em>g</em>w<em>asilēwes</em> (qa-si-re-we) in Linear B texts. According to Frame 2009 ch. 7, the twelve kings of the Phaeacians may represent a mythological replica of the confederation known as the Ionian Dodecapolis as it existed around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405.) </p>

tags: dais 'feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice', terpesthai ‘feel delight’, stylized festival, aoidē ‘song’, humnos (reconstructed meaning: 'web' or 'connecting by way of fabric work'), A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 8.429

<p>Alkinoos wishes that the feasting should continue and that Odysseus should continue to ‘feel delight’, as expressed by <em>terpesthai</em>, while he hears at this feast the ‘weaving’ of the <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ that started with the First Song of Demodokos and that will now connect with the Third Song. In this context, we see the meaning of the noun <em>dais</em> extended from the specific idea of ‘feast’ to the more general idea of a stylized‘festival’. And the continued weaving of the song, which corresponds to the continuation of the stylized festival, is expressed here by way of the noun <em>humnos</em>, which is attested only here and nowhere else in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em>. In this unique context at O.08.429, the meaning of <em>humnos</em> can be reconstructed as ‘web’ or ‘connecting by way of fabric work’. In terms of such a reconstructed meaning, the <em>humnos</em> as a ‘web’ connects the First and the Second and the Third Songs of Demodokos and forms a continuum of song that extends throughout <em>Odyssey</em> 8, as if the ongoing <em>dais</em> of this Rhapsody were not only a continued <em>feast</em> but also a sustained <em>festival</em>. This festival makes room for events of athletics as well as songmaking. </p>

So, the starting point of the Third Song is not where the singer had left off when he last sang about the Trojan War. Demodokos will have to begin his story at a new starting-point, at a later starting point. [[GN 2017.05.19 via HC 2§311.]]</p>

But others of them were in the company of Odysseus, the one with the great glory, and they were already |503 sitting hidden inside the Horse, which was now in the meeting place of the Trojans. |504 The Trojans themselves had pulled the Horse into the acropolis. |505 So there it was, standing there, while they [= the Trojans] were saying many different things, |506 sitting around it. There were three different plans: |507 to cut open the hollow wood with pitiless bronze, |508 or to throw it off the rocky heights after pulling it up to the peak [of the acropolis], |509 or to leave it, great artifact [<em>agalma</em>] that it was, as a charm [<em>thelktērion</em>] of the gods |510 —which, I now see it, was exactly the way it was sure to [<em>mellein</em>] reach an outcome [<em>teleutân</em>], |511 because it was fate [<em>aisa</em>] that the place would be destroyed, once the city had enfolded in itself |512 the great Wooden Horse, when all the best men were sitting inside it, |513 the Argives [= Achaeans], that is, bringing slaughter and destruction upon the Trojans. |514 He sang how the sons of the Achaeans destroyed the city, |515 pouring out of the Horse, leaving behind the hollow place of ambush. |516 He sang how the steep citadel was destroyed by different men in different places. |517 —how Odysseus went to the palace of Deiphobos, |518 how he was looking like Ares, and godlike Menelaos went with him, |519 and how in that place, I now see it, he [= Demodokos] said that he [= Odysseus] dared to go through the worst part of the war, |520 and how he emerged victorious after that, with the help of Athena, the one with the mighty spirit. |521 Thus sang the singer [<em>aoidos</em>], the one whose glory is supreme. And Odysseus |522 dissolved [<em>tēkesthai</em>] into tears. He made wet his cheeks with the tears flowing from his eyelids, |523 just as a woman cries, falling down and embracing her dear husband, |524 who fell in front of the city and people he was defending, |525 trying to ward off the pitiless day of doom hanging over the city and its children. |526 She sees him dying, gasping for his last breath, |527 and she pours herself all over him as she wails with a piercing cry. But there are men behind her, |528 prodding her with their spears, hurting her back and shoulders, |529 and they bring for her a life of bondage, which will give her pain and sorrow. |530 Her cheeks are wasting away with a sorrow [<em>akhos</em>] that is most pitiful [<em>eleeinon</em>]. |531 So also did Odysseus pour out a piteous tear [<em>dakruon</em>] from beneath his brows; |532 there he was, escaping the notice of all while he kept pouring out his tears [<em>dakrua</em>].|533 But Alkinoos was the only one of all of them who was aware, and he took note [<em>noeîn</em>]. </p><p>Complying with the request of Odysseus, Demodokos begins the story of his Third Song at a later point in the story—evidently later than where he had left off before. As signaled at O.08.500, the story begins with the Wooden Horse, exactly as Odysseus had requested. And the story can now focus on the greatest deed accomplished by Odysseus in the Trojan War: he was the hero who invented the Wooden Horse. Here was a feat of intelligence that finally resulted in the capture of Troy by the Achaeans. But the story also focuses on what was perhaps the worst deed of Odysseus in the Trojan War: as we can read in the surviving plot-outline of the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, an epic belonging to the epic Cycle and attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, Odysseus had a major role in the grim story of Troy’s final hours. He was the Achaean hero who captured Andromache, widow of Hector, and who executed the child of this doomed couple. But right before Demodokos reaches this horrific part of the story, Odysseus breaks down in tears, and his tears will interrupt the outcome of this story. The interruption, as we see in the narration that I have just quoted, takes the form of a simile that compares the weeping of the hero with the lament of an unnamed woman who has just been captured in war, O.08.521–531. The simile of the unnamed lamenting woman is substituted for the outcome of the story that tells of the final tearful moments of Troy’s destruction (HC 2§§334–344). In the epic Cycle, as represented by the <em>Iliou Persis</em>, that unnamed lamenting woman would be Andromache (<em>HC</em> 2§344). In the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, the tears of the captive woman lead to the tears of Odysseus, which in turn can now lead to the story of his own odyssey as a continuation of the tearful story that almost ended the narrative continuum at the feast of the Phaeacians. The story can now continue, shifting from an <em>Iliad</em> to an <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>

Then, he asks an alternative question at O.08.584–586: or did you lose a <em>hetairos</em> ‘companion’ in the Trojan War? Well, Odysseus did in fact lose many companions, but the greatest of them all was Achilles. Pointedly, Alkinoos refers to the sadness of Odysseus as <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ at O.08.541.

The poetic bravura of Demodokos, blind singer of the Phaeacians, will now be superseded by a masterpiece of epic narration performed by Odysseus himself, who is starting to sing his own epic odyssey. The hero’s song will extend from the beginning of Rhapsody 9 here all the way through the end of Rhapsody 12, and the size of this song, consisting of four rhapsodies, will correspond to one-twelfth of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> combined. Odysseus will perform his song in the style of the <em>Homēridai</em>, notional descendants of Homer who performed the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> in relay. The relay performance, which was competitive as well as collaborative, consisted of twelve units, each unit consisting of four rhapsodies, and it took place at the seasonally recurring festival of the Panionia at a place called the Panionion in Asia Minor. As already noted before, this festival was the political and cultural self-expression of the Ionian Dodecapolis, a confederation of twelve states that reached its apogee in the eastern Greek world during the late eighth and early seventh century BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on O.07.321; also on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405; see also under <em>Ionian Dodecapolis </em>in the Words and Ideas.) The division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> into twelve units, six for the <em>Iliad</em> and six for the <em>Odyssey</em>, with each unit containing four rhapsodies, corresponds to the division of the Ionian confederation into twelve states. It may be argued, then, that each one of the twelve states of the Ionian Dodecapolis fielded a rhapsode for performing competitively one of the twelve epic units. Which rhapsode was assigned which one of the twelve epic units could have been determined by lottery or perhaps by way of seasonal rotation. It may also be argued that the rhapsodic unit extending from the start of Rhapsody 9 here all the way through the end of Rhapsody 12 represents an idealized rhapsodic performance in the style of the <em>Homēridai</em>. And Rhapsody 9 begins with a kind of Homeric signature at O.09.03–011—the mark of Homer, as it were.</p>

As Odysseus himself says here, as he finally proceeds to identify himself, there no greater <em>kharis</em> or ‘gratification’ in the whole world than the combination of good feasting and good singing, and the model for the general reference to singing here is the singer Demodokos. The <em>kharis</em> ‘gratification’ is signaled by the adjective <em>khariestero</em>- ‘more gratifying’ at O.09.005, referring to a <em>telos</em> ‘outcome’: <em>there is no outcome that is more gratifying than what happens at a feast</em>. The word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’, O.09.006, signals the poetic occasion. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198). The feast that is going on here at the beginning of Rhapsody 9 is a continuation of the feast that is already signaled by the word <em>dais </em>at O.08.429, which basically means ‘feast’. In that context, <em>dais</em> refers short-range to an occasion of communal dining as indicated by the word <em>dorpon </em>‘dinner’, O.08.395, which will take place after sunset, O.08.417. The intended guest of honor at this feast will be Odysseus. This occasion of communal dining leads into the third song of Demodokos, O.08.484–485. But this same word <em>dais</em> at O.08.429 is also making a long-range reference: it refers metonymically to a stylized festival that has been ongoing ever since an earlier occasion of communal dining, O.08.071–072, which actually led into the first song of Demodokos. O.08.073–083. And the connectivity goes even further back in time. Leading up to the communal dining, there had been an animal sacrifice as expressed by the word <em>hiereuein</em> ‘sacrificially slaughter’ at O.08.059. Then, the meat of the sacrificed animals had been prepared to be cooked at the feast, O.08.061. And I stress that the word at O.08.061 for ‘feast’ is once again <em>dais</em>. In terms of this sequence, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals. </p>

<p>  </p><p>Odysseus’ contemplation of the ideal feast while visiting the Phaeacians presents us with a picture of the sort of situation where <em>kharis</em> (reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of <em>kharis</em>) points to the upholding of good social order, and the meal can be seen as a manifestation of the good social bond in the community. Here, not only is the ideal meal pleasant, endowed with <em>kharis</em> and <em>euphrosune</em>, ‘good cheer’ – Euphrosyne even being the name of one of the Kharites – but it is orderly (<em>ἑξείης</em>, “in order,” O.9.8) and upheld as the best state of affairs (<em>κάλλιστον</em>, “finest,” “most beautiful,” “best,” O.9.11). The participants in such a meal, then, are morally good, following the principles for good conduct. This ideal meal, endowed with <em>kharis</em>, is in stark contrast with the one foreshadowing the doom of the suitors at O.20.392-394 (where see my comment), described as <em>akharistos</em>, ‘lacking <em>kharis</em>,’ and payback for their evil deeds. </p><span>See further:</span><p>MacLachlan, Bonnie. 1993. <em>The Age of Grace: Charis in Early Greek Poetry</em>.

# Odyssey 9.19-9.20

<p>As with <em>Odyssey</em> 12.69-70 (Ἀργὼ πᾶσι μέλουσα 'the Argo, which-is-on-the-minds-of all'), we find some topic πᾶσι μέλειν 'to-be-on-the-minds-of all humans'. This time, that which is on the mind of the poet as he recites and, by universal extension, on the minds of all humans, is the speaker of the lines, Odysseus himself. Unlike with the Argo of <em>Odyssey </em>12.69, however, there is a delay here in expressing this universalizing of Odysseus from the mind of the poet to the minds of all humans. The wording begins by saying that I, Odysseus, am linked with 'all' (πᾶσι) my acts of trickery (δόλοισιν), and only then, at line 20, does the wording go on to say the 'I-am-on-the-minds-of' (μέλω) humans. Now the idea that these humans are 'all' (πᾶσι) humans in the universe must be carried over from line 19. What we see in this carrying over is a construction known in ancient rhetoric as <em>apo koinou </em>(ἀπὸ κοινοῦ) 'by way of shared application', where a word is applied consecutively to two different syntactical situations. In this case, <em>pāsi </em>(πᾶσι) 'all' applies first only to the noun <em>doloisin </em>(δόλοισιν), but then, in the next line, to <em>anthrōpoisi  </em>(ἀνθρώποισι) 'humans' in a different syntactical situation. Because the application is consecutive, we can understand the lines as meaning: 'first, I am linked with <em>all</em> my acts of trickery, and then, second, I am on the minds of <em>all</em> humans.'</p>

<p>εἴμ’ Ὀδυσεὺς Λαερτιάδης, ὃς πᾶσι δόλοισιν | ἀνθρώποισι μέλω, καί μευ κλέος οὐρανὸν ἵκει.</p><p>I am Odysseus son of Laertes, and I, with all [πᾶσι] my acts of trickery, | I-am-on-the-minds-of [<em>melein</em> (μέλω)] all (πᾶσι) humans, and my glory [<em>kleos</em>] reaches all the way up to the sky.</p><p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2016.02.11§§4–7.) Here at O.09.019–020, Homeric poetry is channeling Odysseus in the act of starting to tell his own story. The wording begins by saying at O.09.019 that I, Odysseus, am linked with ‘all’ (πᾶσι) my acts of trickery, and only then, at O.09.020, does the wording go on to say that ‘I-am-on-the-minds-of’ (μέλω) humans—but now the idea that these humans are ‘all’ (πᾶσι) humans in the universe has to be carried over from the previous line, O.09.019. What we see here is a construction known in ancient rhetoric as <em>apo koinou</em> (ἀπὸ κοινοῦ) ‘by way of shared application’, where a word is applied consecutively to two different syntactical situations. (In 2016.02.11§4, I cite an example in Sappho Song 1 lines 7–8). In the Homeric example that we are now considering, O.09.019–020, the adjective <em>pāsi</em> (πᾶσι) meaning ‘all’ applies first only to the noun <em>doloisi</em> (δόλοισι) meaning ‘acts of trickery’ at line 19, but then at line 20 it applies also—and in a different syntactical situation—to the noun <em>anthrōpoisi</em> (ἀνθρώποισι) meaning ‘humans’. This way, the meaning ‘all’ applies to two different words belonging to two different syntactical situations. And the application of the meaning is consecutive: first, I am linked with ‘all my acts of trickery’, and then, second, I am on the minds of ‘all humans’. The verb <em>melein</em>, which I translate here with the wording ‘be-on-one’s-mind’, normally has as its grammatical subject whatever is on the mind of someone. In everyday contexts, what is on the mind of someone is incidental: someone happens to be thinking about something, and so that something is on the mind of that someone. In Homeric contexts, however, whatever is on someone’s mind is special and worthy of being recorded in poetry. Here is a striking example: when Andromache in the <em>Iliad</em> says to Hector that she is thinking thoughts about the uncertain future that awaits her and the child they had together, he remarks that ‘all these things are-on-my-mind [<em>melei</em>] as well’, I.06.441: ἦ καὶ ἐμοὶ τάδε πάντα μέλει. Such things are the subject of Homeric poetry, and so Homer must have such things on his mind as well. In poetic as also in prosaic contexts, the things that are on someone’s mind may be simply things that this someone is thinking about. But they may be more than that, as in the example I just gave concerning the things that are on the minds of Andromache and Hector. And these things are not just thoughts: they are caring thoughts, concerned thoughts, even worried thoughts. A word that refers to a song about such worried thoughts, as an expression of caring and concern, is <em>merimna</em> ‘care’, as used in the <em>Hippolytus</em> of Euripides, with reference to a custom originating in the city of Trozen, where girls who were celebrating their coming of age are seen in the act of singing and dancing a song. Their song is described as a sad love song, ‘a troubled thought that comes along with songmaking’ (μουσοποιὸς … μέριμνα 1428–1429). The noun that I translate here as ‘a troubled thought’ is <em>merimna</em>, which means literally a ‘care’ or a ‘concern’. A <em>merimna</em>, in other words, is what you have on your mind. In a song of Bacchylides (19.11), the same noun <em>merimna</em>, which I translate here as ‘a troubled thought’, refers to the thought-processes of the poet himself as he is pictured in the act of composing his song. A <em>merimna</em>, then, is a song that is ‘on one’s mind’. Similarly, I argue, the noun <em>melos</em> in the sense of ‘melody’ is derived from <em>melei</em> ‘is on one’s mind’; a <em>melos</em> is a song that is ‘on one’s mind’. Further examples in Nagy 2016.02.11§7. </p>

# Odysseus 9.82-104

<p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 10§§8–9.) As we saw already at the very beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the hero’s <em>nostos</em>, ‘return’ at O.01.005 connects with his <em>nóos</em> ‘mind, thinking’ at O.01.003 not only in the explicit sense of <em>thinking about saving his own life</em> but also in the implicit sense of <em>being conscious of returning home</em>. This implicit sense is encoded in the telling of the myth about the land of the Lotus-Eaters here at O.09.082–104. When Odysseus visits this land, those of his comrades who eat the lotus lose their consciousness of home and therefore lose their power to return home. The verb <em>lēth-</em>, ‘forget’, combined with <em>nostos</em>, ‘return’, as its object, conveys the idea of such unconsciousness, O.09.097/102. By contrast, the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind, thinking’ conveys the idea of being conscious of <em>nostos</em>. So, here is the basic teaching to be learned from the myth about the land of the Lotus-Eaters: if you lose the “implant” of homecoming in your mind, you cannot go home because you no longer know what home is. </p>

# Odyssey 9.94-97

<p>Just as memory is the principle that maintains good behavior and keeps one on the right track (cp. <em>Od</em>. 2.229-41 and see note there), this passage illustrates the power of forgetting in leading people astray from their proper path and failing to do the right thing. Eating lotus makes Odysseus’ men want νόστου τε λαθέσθαι ‘forget return home’ (the same effect of forgetting caused by lotus at <em>Od</em>. 9.102). Not only do they no longer think about it, but they are unable to act on it either: it takes Odysseus’ using force to bring them back to their ship and carry on. Indeed, forgetting appears to be one of the main obstacles for Odysseus’ reaching home (cp. <em>Od</em>. 1.57, 10.236), and Ithaca, or <em>nostos</em>, is one of the two recurring objects of forgetting in the <em>Odyssey </em>(the other object being grief, regularly <em>un</em>forgettable, e.g. Penelope’s unforgettable grief at the loss of Odysseus, <em>Od</em>. 1.342). In contrast, it is with a call to <em>remember</em> his fatherland that Odysseus’ companions get him to act and make him continue on his way home from Kirke’s island (<em>Od.</em> 10.472).</p>

# Odyssey 9.125

<p>(Epitomized from PP 172.) Eustathius (1.9), in the Prolegomena to his commentary on the <em>Iliad</em>, says that performers of the <em>Iliad</em> wore red while performers of the <em>Odyssey</em> wore purple. He may perhaps be guessing when he attributes to ‘the ancients’ the idea that red stands for the blood shed in war, and purple, for the sea, as the setting for the wanderings of Odysseus. Still, his report about the actual dichotomy in color seems to be grounded in tradition. In Homeric diction, we find a parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on ships: we already saw <em>nēes miltoparēioi</em> ‘ships having cheeks of red’ at I.02.637, with reference to the ships of Odysseus, and now we see it again here at O.09.125, with reference to generic ships. To be contrasted is the expression <em>neas</em> <em>phoinīkoparēious</em> ‘ships with cheeks of purple’ at O.11.124 and O.23.271. Moreover, the inventories of chariots in the Linear B tablets show yet another parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on chariots: the noun i-qi-ja ‘chariot’ is described as either mi-to-we-sa = <em>miltówessa</em> ‘red’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4407 or po-ni-ki-ja = <em>phoinikiā</em> ‘purple’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4402. For the translation ‘purple’ in the latter case, I note φοινικόβαπτα ἐσθήματα ‘clothing dyed in purple’ in Aeschylus <em>Eumenides</em> 1028. </p>

# Odyssey 9.355-9.422

<p> </p><p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2007b:70–72.) Even in situations where the <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ of Odysseus in the specialized sense of ‘craft’ helps advance the homecoming of the hero in the <em>Odyssey</em>, it does nothing to advance the <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ of his past epic exploits at Troy. A case in point is the decisive moment in the <em>Odyssey</em> when Odysseus devises the stratagem of calling himself <em>Outis</em> ‘no one’, O.09.366, in order to deceive and then blind Polyphemus the Cyclops. The pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’ used by the hero for the crafting of his false name deceives not only the Cyclops but also the monster’s fellow Cyclopes when they use the same pronoun to ask the blinded Polyphemus this question: <em>perhaps someone has wronged you?</em>—O.09.405–406. The syntax of the question, expressing the uncertainty of the questioners, requires the changing of the pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’ into its modal byform <em>mē tis</em> ‘perhaps someone’, which sounds like the noun <em>mētis </em>‘craft’. The modal byform <em>mē tis </em>is intentionally signaling here the verbal craft used by Odysseus in devising this stratagem. And this intentional act of signaling is made explicit later on when the narrating hero actually refers to his stratagem as a <em>mētis</em>, O.09.414. The same can be said about the hero’s previous stratagem of blinding the Cyclops with a sharpened stake, an act of craftiness compared to the craft of blacksmiths, O.09.390–394. These and all other stratagems used by the hero against the Cyclops qualify as <em>mētis</em> ‘craft’, O.09.422. It goes without saying that the stratagem of crafting the false name <em>Outis</em> succeeds: when the blinded Cyclops answers the question of his fellow Cyclopes, <em>perhaps someone has wronged you?</em>—O.09.405–406—he uses the non-modal form of the pronoun, saying<em> ou tis ‘no one’ has wronged me</em>, O.09.408. Still, though this stratagem succeeds in rescuing Odysseus (and, for the moment, some of his companions), it fails to rescue the hero’s past <em>kleos</em> in Troy. In fact, the stratagem of Odysseus in calling himself <em>Outis</em> ‘no one’ produces just the opposite effect: it erases any previous claim to any <em>kleos</em> that the hero would have had before he entered the cave of the Cyclops. Such erasure is signaled by the epithet <em>outidanos</em> ‘good-for-nothing’, derivative of the pronoun <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’: whenever this epithet is applied to a hero in the <em>Iliad</em>, it is intended to revile the name of that hero by erasing his epic identity, as at I.11.390. Such erasure means that someone who used to have a name will now no longer have a name and has therefore become a <em>nobody</em>, a <em>no one</em>, <em>ou tis</em>. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, the Cyclops reviles the name of the man who blinded him by applying this same epithet <em>outidanos</em> ‘good-for-nothing’ to the false name <em>Outis</em>, O.09.460. The effect of applying this epithet completes the erasure of the hero’s past identity that was started by Odysseus when he renamed himself as <em>ou tis</em> ‘no one’. The name that the hero had heretofore achieved for himself has been reduced to nothing and must hereafter be rebuilt from nothing. It is relevant that the annihilation of the hero’s identity happens in the darkness of an otherworldly cave, in the context of extinguishing the light of the single eye of the Cyclops, thereby darkening forever the monster’s power to see the truth unless he hears it. </p>

# Odyssey 9.390-9.394

<p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2007b:61.) The power of the Homeric simile in advancing the plot of epic is evident in the simile here at O.09.390–394, referring to the blinding of the Cyclops: when Odysseus and his men thrust into the single eye of the monster the fire-hardened tip of a wooden stake they had just crafted, the sound produced by this horrific act is compared to the sound produced when a blacksmith is tempering steel as he thrusts into cold water the red-hot edge of the axe or adze he is crafting. From a cross-cultural survey of myths that tell how a hero who stands for the civilizing forces of <em>culture</em> blinds a monster who stands for the brutalizing forces of <em>nature</em>, it becomes clear that such myths serve the purpose of providing an aetiology for <em>the invention of technology</em> (Burkert 1979:33–34). It is no coincidence that the <em>three Cyclopes</em> in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em> (139–146) are imagined as exponents of technology: they are identified as the <em>three blacksmiths</em> who crafted the thunderbolt of Zeus (Burkert 1979:156n23). Thus the simile about the tempering of steel in the Homeric narration of the blinding of the Cyclops serves the purpose of contextualizing and even advancing that narration by way of highlighting aspects of an underlying myth that is otherwise being shaded over. </p>

# Odyssey 9.566/ Anchor Comment on: ásmenos (ἄσμενος) ‘returning to light and life’

<p>Odysseus and his companions have escaped from the cave of the Cyclops, where some of them died, and now the survivors are sailing on, described as <em>ásmenoi</em>, which I translate as ‘returning to light and life’. As argued by Frame 1978:6–33 (also 2009:39–41), the etymology of this participle <em>ásmenos</em> can be explained by deriving it from *<em>n̥s-menos</em>, where the element *<em>n̥s-</em> is the zero grade of the Indo-European root <em>*nes-</em>, meaning ‘return to light and life’. This etymology has been confirmed by de Lamberterie 2014. Here at O.09.566, the etymological explanation ‘returning to light and life’ corresponds to what has just happened to Odysseus and his companions: they have escaped from the darkness of the cave and from the threat of death there, emerging into the light and thus winning back their lives. So, they have literally returnd to light and life. For more on the semantics of ‘return to light and life’ as conveyed by the words <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.003. </p>

<p>With the help of king Aeolus, keeper of the winds, Odysseus and his companions sail off from this king’s island, propelled by Zephyros, the West Wind, O.10.025. So, they are traveling from west to east. At O.11.0028–030, we see that they have already sailed for nine days, and then, on the tenth day, Ithaca finally comes into view. But now Odysseus falls asleep at the steering oar, and his companions make the human error of opening the Bag of Winds, so that their ships are blown back, east to west—all the way back to where they started, to the island of Aeolus, O.10.031–055. Aeolus now refuses to help Odysseus and his companions any further, O.056–076, and, as they sail on, O.077–79, it is no longer clear where they are headed. No longer will they be propelled toward Ithaca by the favoring West Wind that Aeolus had provided for them earlier. Their sea voyage is now directionless, and, by the time their ship reaches the land of the Laestrygonians, they have already lost their navigational compass, since this land appears to be a twilight zone, O.080–086. The disorientation will only intensify later, after Odysseus and some of his companions manage to escape from the land of the Laestrygonians and sail to the island of Circe: see the comment on O.10.189–202. </p>

# Odyssey 10.189-10.202

<p>Odysseus here at O.10.189–197 confesses to his companions that he no longer knows where the sun rises or where the sun sets, O.10.190–192, and, accordingly, he expresses his own despair by questioning whether there will be for him any further access to <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, O.10.193. So, the disorientation of Odysseus is linked with loss of <em>mētis</em>. Clearly, the mind of the hero is correlated here with the celestial dynamics of sunset and sunrise. See further the comment on O.10.190–102. (More on this subject in GMP 246.) In response to the hero’s expression of despair, his companions weep uncontrollably, O.10.198–202, and now all they can think about are the horrors they remember having experienced in their encounters with the Cyclops and with Antiphates the Laestrygonian, O.10.199–200. The epithet for one of these two monsters here, the Cyclops, is <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’, O.10.200, which suits not only the cannibalistic Cyclops but also Antiphates the Laestrygonian, who as can see at O.10.115–116 is likewise a cannibal. These memories of cannibalism are most telling, since the name of the Cyclops is linked here with the <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ of this monster, O.10.200. And the link surely extends to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. That monster too, like the Cyclops, is a negative exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’. And such memories evoke the worst moments of the story of the Trojan War as narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>, as when Achilles himself expresses the ghastly urge to eat the body of Hector raw, I.22.346–347. See the comment at I.22.346–348; also at I.23.001–064. So, Achilles as the primary exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ in the <em>Iliad</em> can be seen in this context as a foil for Odysseus as the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in the <em>Odyssey</em>. Even the Iliadic contexts of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ are evoked here, since Cyclops at O.10.200 is described not only as <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’ but also as <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’. Similarly at O.10.106, in an attested variant of that verse, this same description applies also to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. Beyond these two attestations, this epithet <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’ occurs nowhere else in the <em>Odyssey</em>, whereas it occurs regularly as a conventional description of generic warriors in the <em>Iliad</em>. That is why I propose to describe the horrific visions of cannibals in the <em>Odyssey</em> as Iliadic nightmares. </p>

Still, let us start thinking it through, as quickly as we can, |193 whether there is still any craft [<em>mētis</em>] left. I must tell you, though, I think there is none. </p><p>(Epitomized from H24H 10§§38, 40, 42.) When Odysseus reaches the island of Circe and learns that this place, though it first seems familiar and reminiscent of his own island, is in fact strange and alien and antithetical to home, he despairs. The hero feels he has no intelligence or <em>mētis</em>  left in him to devise a stratagem for a successful homecoming, and his despair is expressed as a feeling of disorientation. He is no longer able to distinguish between orient and occident. To restate in terms of two words used elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the hero is experiencing a loss of orientation in his <em>nóos</em> or ‘thinking’, and this loss is presently blocking his <em>nostos</em>, ‘homecoming’. Despite such moments of disorientation for Odysseus, however, his <em>nóos</em>, ‘thinking’ will ultimately reorient him, steering him away from his Iliadic past and toward his ultimate Odyssean future. That is, the hero’s <em>nóos</em> will make it possible for him to achieve a <em>nostos</em>, which is not only his ‘homecoming’ but also the ‘song about a homecoming’ that is the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p>

<p>In Point 2 of the comment on O.01.001–010, it was noted that the god Hermes, as the ultimate shape-shifter, is described as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> (verses 13, 439). Here at O.10.330, Odysseus is likewise described as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’, and the description is happening in a context where the hero is explicitly being linked with the god Hermes. So, Odysseus too is a shape-shifter, like his divine model Hermes. The importance of this quality of Odysseus as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ is highlighted by the use of this epithet in the very first verse of the <em>Odyssey</em>.

But the others [in Hādēs] just flit about, like shadows [<em>skiai</em>].</p><p>Circe describes for Odysseus what to expect when he sees Teiresias in Hādēs. Exceptionally, the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of the hero, O.10.492, will have consciousness: that is, his <em>phrenes</em> ‘thinking’ will be <em>empedoi</em> ‘grounded’, O.10.493. On <em>phrenes</em> in the sense of ‘thinking’, see the anchor comment at O.01.320, where I note that Homeric diction leaves room for the idea that you can think with your heart. But what is it that confers on the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Teiresias the exceptional power to think even when he is dead, in Hādēs? The answer is given at O.10.494–495: Persephone, queen of Hādēs, has exceptionally given permission for Teiresias to have the <em>nóos</em> ‘consciousness’, O.10.494, that is needed for ‘thinking’, <em>pepnûsthai</em>, even in Hādēs. Here I translate <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ as ‘consciousness’, referring to the mystical force that will reintegrate the consciousness of the self with the body after death. It is relevant that the <em>nóos</em> or ‘consciousness’ of the ‘spirit’ or <em>psūkhē</em> of the seer Teiresias is properly activated only after he drinks the blood of two sacrificial sheep that Odysseus slaughters in order to make mental contact, as we will see at O.11.095–098. I offer further analysis in H24H 11§35. But there is a complication that I did not note in that analysis: Circe instructs Odysseus to perform a libation for the dead when he is in Hādēs, O.10.516–520, and he is further instructed to promise in a prayer directed at these dead that he will perform a sacrifice for them if he succeeds in getting back home to Ithaca: there Odysseus will slaughter a barren cow for the dead in general, O.10.522–523, and a black ram for Teiresias in particular, O.10.524–525. When the right time comes in Hādēs, and Odysseus performs his libations for the dead, O11.024–028, he will follow through and make that promise to them, namely, that he will sacrifice in Ithaca a barren cow for the dead in general, O.11.029–030, and a black ram for Teiresias in particular, O.11.032–033. (At H24H 11§35, I leave it unsaid that this black ram to be sacrificed in Ithaca is different from the black ram and black ewe that Odysseus sacrifices in Hādēs: see the comment on O.10.521–537.) As we know from external sources, such as Pausanias 5.13.1-2, a black ram is the preferred sacrificial animal to slaughter for the purpose of making mental contact with a male cult hero (H24H 0§11).  </p>

<p>Having arrived at the Ōkeanos, Odysseus and his companions beach their ship there and disembark, Ο.11.020, proceeding to the place in Hādēs where Circe had instructed them to make sacrifice to the dead, Ο.11.021–022. To get there, they go along the streams of the Ōkeanos, O.11.021. It is not said explicitly here that they have crossed the Ōkeanos in order to make their entrance into Hādēs, though the crossing is made explicit in the instructions of Circe at O.10.508. See the comment on O.10.508–512, Nor is it said that they will cross the Ōkeanos when they finally make their exit from Hādēs, O.11.636–640. When they do make their exit, Odysseus and his companions are pictured as reembarking on their ship and navigating it in the streams of the Ōkeanos, O.11.639–640, heading back to the sea that will take them back to the island of Circe. Then, at O.12.001–003, when they finally reach the sea again, from where they will navigate back to the island of Circe, this island is situated no longer in the Extreme West but in the Extreme East, O.12.003–004. So, by implication, they will have navigated all the way around the world by way of the Ōkeanos, from the Extreme West all the way to the Extreme East. This circumnavigation ends up at the same place where it started, at the island of Circe, but now this island is situated not in the Extreme West but in the Extreme East. So, the location of Aiaia, this island of Circe, is a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. The achievement of such a coincidence by way of the Ōkeanos can be imagined as either a looping around the world or, better, a looping under the world: either way, the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos flows from West to East to West to East and so on forever. For more on coincidences of opposites, see the comments at I.01.423–425 and at O.01.022–026, O.10.135. </p>

<p>Here at O.11.029–036, Odysseus continues to follow the instructions of Circe as articulated earlier at O.10.521–537: in the course of offering his libation, in Hādēs, to the dead, Odysseus should also offer them a prayer, promising them that, if he succeeds in getting back home to Ithaca, he will then sacrifice there a barren cow for the dead in general, O.11.030–031, and a black ram for Teiresias in particular, O.11.032–033. And then, after having performed this prayer and these promises for all the dead, he sacrifices the two sheep that he and his companions have brought with them from the island of Circe by cutting their throats, O.11.034–035, and then letting their blood flow into the shallow <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’ that he has dug, O.11.036. Unlike O.10.526–527, where the sheep are said to be one black ram and one black ewe, these details are omitted here at O.11.034–035. Conversely, the detail at O.11.035–036 about the blood that flows into the <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’ from the cut throats of the sheep had been omitted at O.10.526–527. Likewise omitted at O.10.536–537—though it is implied—is the picturing of the dead in the act of actually drinking from the pit this blood that has flowed there from the cut throats of the sheep. Such drinking cannot happen, as Circe had instructed, until Teiresias arrives at the scene, O.10.536–537. And now that the blood has actually flowed into the pit, the instructions of Circe must be followed: no drinking of blood can be allowed until Teiresias arrives at the scene and drinks first, O.11.049–050. Teiresias finally gets to have his drink of blood only in O.11.095–098. Once he has his drink, Teiresias will make mental contact with Odysseus. See already the comment on O.10.490–495.  </p>

<p>The very first <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of all the dead in Hādēs who will speak to Odysseus in Hādēs is Elpenor, O.11.051–083, who had been left behind, dead an unburied, on the island of Circe. The story of his death was told at O.10.551–560. In the comment on those verses, I already noted that the relevance of this figure to the homecoming of Odysseus is signaled here at O.11.051–083. And there will be a further signal at O.12.014–015. </p>

# Odyssey 11.71-73

<p>This passage demonstrates the reciprocity, or complementarity, of memory and <em>mēnis</em> in the context of upholding proper social and cosmic order and the value system based on reciprocal exchange. Elpenor asks Odysseus to remember (<em>μνήσασθαι</em>, <em>Od</em>. 11.71) him and the funerary rites that are his due so as not to have Elpenor become a <em>mēnima</em>, ‘cause of <em>mēnis</em>’ (<em>Od</em>. 11.73), of the gods toward Odysseus. If Odysseus remembers and performs the rites, all is well, the cosmic order is maintained; if he forgets, he will incur <em>mēnis </em>as a punishment. Here, too, we can see that memory leads to proper conduct and helps avoid both the wrong courses of action and <em>mēnis</em>; <em>mēnis</em>, in turn, is the punishment when the rules are transgressed, and the fear of <em>mēnis</em> keeps one on the right path. This is central to the complementarity of memory and <em>mēnis </em>and neatly illustrated by the passage: when there is memory, there will be no <em>mēnis</em>, as memory keeps one mindful of the danger of incurring <em>mēnis</em>, and so helps avoid it in the first place. On the contrary, there will only be <em>mēnis</em> when this memory is absent. The relationship between memory and <em>mēnis </em>is thus not of perfectly symmetrical reciprocity, but the provision of one in the absence of the other.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Watkins, Calvert. 1977. “On Μῆνις.” <em>Indo-European Studies</em> 3:686-722.</p>

He recognized me and said, |92 “Odysseus, you who are descended from the gods, noble son of Laertes, |93 why, wretched man, have you left the light of day |94 and come down to see the dead in this place without any delights? |95 Stand back from the trench and draw back your sharp sword |96 so that I may drink of the blood and tell you unmistakably true things.” |97 So he spoke, and I [= Odysseus] drew back, and sheathed my silver-studded sword, |98 putting it back into the scabbard, and then he [= Teiresias], after he had drunk the black blood, |99 began to address me with his words, faultless seer [<em>mantis</em>] that he was: |100 “It’s your homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] that you seek, a homecoming sweet as honey, O radiant Odysseus. |101 But the god will make this painful for you. I say that because I do not think |102 that the earth-shaking god [= Poseidon] will not take notice, who has lodged in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] an anger [<em>kotos</em>] against you, |103 being angry that you blinded his dear son [= Polyphemus]. |104 Still, even so, after enduring many bad experiences, you all may get home |105 if you are willing to restrain your own heart [<em>thūmos</em>] and the heart of your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>] |106 when you pilot your well-built ship to |107 the island of Thrinacia, seeking refuge from the violet-colored sea, |108 and when you find the grazing cattle and the sturdy sheep |109 that belong to the god of the sun, Hēlios, who sees everything and hears everything. |110 If you leave these herds unharmed and think only about homecoming [<em>nostos</em>], |111 then you could still make it to Ithaca, arriving there after having endured many bad experiences. |112 But if you harm the herds, then I forewarn you of destruction |113 both for your ship and for your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], and, even if you may yourself escape, |114 you will return [<em>neesthai</em>] in a bad way, losing all your companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], |115 in someone else’s ship, not your own, and you will find painful things happening in your house, |116 I mean, you will find high-handed men there who are devouring your livelihood |117 while they are courting your godlike wife and offering wedding-presents to her. |118 But you will avenge the outrages committed by those men when you get home. |119 But after you kill the suitors in your own house, |120 killing them either by trickery or openly, by way of sharp bronze, |121 you must go on a journey then, taking with you a well-made oar, |122 until you come to a place where men do not know what the sea is |123 and do not even eat any food that is mixed with sea salt, |124 nor do they know anything about ships, which are painted purple on each side, |125 and well-made oars that are like wings for ships. |126 And I will tell you a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking. |127 Whenever someone on the road encounters you |128 and says that it must be a winnowing shovel that you have on your radiant shoulder, |129 at that point you must stick into the ground the well-made oar |130 and sacrifice beautiful sacrifices to lord Poseidon: |131 a ram, a bull, and a boar that mounts sows. |132 And then go home and offer sacred hecatombs |133 to the immortal gods who possess the vast expanses of the skies. |134 Sacrifice to them in proper order, one after the other. As for yourself, death shall come to you from the sea, |135 a gentle death, that is how it will come, and this death will kill you |136 as you lose your strength in a prosperous old age. And the people all around [your corpse] |137 will be blessed [<em>olbioi</em>]. All the things I say are unmistakably true.”</p><p>The very first word uttered by Teiresias is <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’, O.11.100. The use of this word here is connected with the fact that, earlier in the narrative, the seer Teiresias is described as exceptionally possessing consciousness even in Hādēs, and the word used for the idea of consciousness is <em>nóos</em>. The revelations of Teiresias are activated by his <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, in the specific sense of ‘consciousness’. See the comment on O.10.490–495, with reference to the permission granted by Persephone for Teiresias to have the <em>nóos</em> ‘consciousness’, O.10.494, that is needed for ‘thinking’, <em>pepnûsthai</em>, even in Hādēs. It is relevant that the <em>nóos</em> or ‘consciousness’ of the ‘spirit’ or <em>psūkhē</em> of the seer Teiresias is properly activated only after he drinks the blood of the two sacrificial sheep that Odysseus slaughters in order to make mental contact with this seer, as we see at O.11.095–098. What Teiresias will then reveal, by way of his <em>nóos</em>, will be a heroic definition for Odysseus, whose goal is to achieve a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’, as signaled at O.11.100. See further the comment on O.11.100. For the centrality of <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>, see especially the comments on O.01.003 and O.01.005. </p>

# Odyssey 11.119-11.137

<p>This stretch of the prophecy made by Teiresias, O.119–137, will extend beyond the plot or narrative frame of the <em>Odyssey</em> as we know it. (What follows is an epitome of H24H 11§§33, 41–44.) In an essay entitled “<em>Sēma</em> and <em>Noēsis</em>: The Hero’s Tomb and the ‘Reading’ of Symbols in Homer and Hesiod” (GMP 202–222), I analyzed at some length the mystical prophecy spoken by the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of the <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’ Teiresias at O.11.119–137 about an odyssey beyond the <em>Odyssey</em>. As I argued in that essay, the verses of this prophecy point to the future death of Odysseus and to the mystical vision of his own tomb, where he will be worshipped as a cult hero. My argument can be divided into four parts:</p><p>Part 1. </p><p>Teiresias is predicting that Odysseus will meet his death in a mystical moment where he experiences <em>a coincidence of opposites</em>. And what is this mystical moment? It is a point where <u>the sea and the negation of the sea coincide</u>. That is, <u>Odysseus goes as far away as possible from the sea, only to experience death from the sea</u>: ‘death shall come to you from the sea, |135 a gentle death’, O.11.134-135. See the comment below on these lines. At this same point, where  the sea and the negation of the sea coincide, the oar that he carries on his shoulder, which is an instrument linked exclusively with the sea, will be mistaken for a winnowing shovel, which is an instrument linked exclusively with the earth, that is, with the cultivation of the land: ‘Whenever someone on the road encounters you |128 and says that it must be a winnowing shovel that you have on your radiant shoulder’, O.11.127-128. And here is another coincidence of opposites: Odysseus at this point must sacrifice to Poseidon, god of the sea, O.11.130-131, even though this point is as far away from the sea as possible. </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>And now we come to a mystical vision: in sacrificing to Poseidon, Odysseus must mark the place of sacrifice by sticking into the ground the oar that he was carrying on his shoulder: ‘at that point you must stick into the ground the well-made oar’, O.11.129. As I will now argue, what we are seeing here is a mystical vision of the tomb of Odysseus himself. The key to my argument is what the <em>psūkhē</em> of Teiresias says in introducing his prophecy: ‘And I [= Teiresias] will tell you [= Odysseus] a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking’, O.11.126. The wording here matches exactly the wording of Nestor addressed to Antilokhos in the <em>Iliad</em>: ‘And I [= Nestor] will tell you [= Antilokhos] a sign [<em>sēma</em>], a very clear one, which will not get lost in your thinking’, I.23.326. In that case, it can be argued that the <em>sēma</em> of Nestor for Antilokhos is a ‘sign’ as marked by the ‘tomb’ of a cult hero who has not yet been identified as Patroklos. See the comment on I.23.326–343. In the <em>Odyssey</em> as well, I argue, the <em>sēma</em> of Teiresias for Odysseus is a ‘sign’ as marked by the ‘tomb’ of a cult hero who has not yet been identified as Odysseus himself.</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>There is archaeological evidence for the existence of a hero cult of Odysseus on the island of Ithaca, dating back to an early period when the <em>Odyssey</em> as we know it was still taking shape (H24H 11§43). And, in the version of the story as we see it in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Odysseus dies finally in Ithaca, which figures here as his homeland, O.11.132–137. In terms of this version of the story, then, Ithaca is recognized in the <em>Odyssey</em> as a prime location for the hero cult of Odysseus.</p><p>Part 4.</p><p>This is not to say, however, that Ithaca was the only place where Odysseus was worshipped as a cult hero. From the testimony of Pausanias 8.44.4, for example, we see traces of a hero cult of Odysseus in landlocked Arcadia, which is located in the Peloponnesus and which is as far away from the sea as you can possibly be in the Peloponnesus. Here is the relevant testimony of Pausanias 8.44.4:</p><p>ἔστι δὲ ἄνοδος ἐξ Ἀσέας ἐς τὸ ὄρος τὸ Βόρειον καλούμενον, καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ ἄκρᾳ τοῦ ὄρους σημεῖά ἐστιν ἱεροῦ· ποιῆσαι δὲ τὸ ἱερὸν Ἀθηνᾷ τε Σωτείρᾳ καὶ Ποσειδῶνι Ὀδυσσέα ἐλέγετο ἀνακομισθέντα ἐξ Ἰλίου.</p><p>There is a path leading uphill from Asea [in Arcadia] to the mountain called the North Mountain [<em>Boreion</em>], and on top of that mountain there are traces of a sacred space; it is said that Odysseus had made this sacred space in honor of Athena the Savior [<em>sōteira</em>] and in honor of Poseidon, in return for his having arrived back home safely from Ilion [= Troy]. </p>

Here, Odysseus stresses that Persephone “bid” the <em>psukhai</em> of the heroines to approach the animals he had slaughtered; at <em>Odyssey</em> 11.385-86, resuming his narration after an “intermezzo” in which he converses with Arete and Alkinoos, Odysseus transitions to the “Catalogue of Heroes” by explaining that Agamemnon appeared “when reverend Persephone scattered in various directions the <em>psukhai</em> of the women.” Odysseus thus presents Persephone as the ‘director’ of this portion of his narrative, a position that corresponds to that of Athena as ‘director’ of the plot of the <em>Odyssey</em> (on Athena as ‘director,’ see Murnaghan 2005, de Jong 2001:66). The emphasis on Persephone, then, is one of several reminders of the fact that the story of Odysseus’ homecoming unfolds as a result of Athena’s active intervention (see note on <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). It also points to the importance of another female sponsor, Arete, at this particular moment in Odysseus’ story. Odysseus has been advised by Athena that his hopes for a homecoming depend especially on Arete's good will (<em>Odyssey</em> 7.75-9; the importance of Arete in this regard seems to figure the importance of Penelope as the woman on whose good will Odysseus’ homecoming ultimately depends). The “Catalogue of Heroines” has been described as “Odysseus’ gift to Arete” (Pache 1999:28), an effort to appeal to her interests just as the “Catalogue of Heroes” explicitly answers Alkinoos’ request to hear about the <em>psukhai </em>of those who fell at Troy. The appeal is a success: Arete responds by urging the Phaeacians to present Odysseus with additional gifts. By underscoring the importance of Persephone as the one who directs the Catalogue, Odysseus may subtly suggest to his patroness that she has the power to direct the subsequent course of his own story.

<p>As we saw at I.02.658, the name of Hēraklēs is linked with the epic theme of <em>biē</em> in the sense of martial ‘force, violence’; even the name of Hēraklēs can be formulated periphrastically as ‘the force of Hēraklēs’. And now we see the same pattern of naming applied to a hero named Iphiklēs.

<p>This passage featuring three Athenian heroines belongs to the Panathenaic version of the catalogue of heroines. It is the final such Athenian expansion of the catalogue, and functions as an "Athenian signature." In the last line of the passage the god Dionysus is mentioned in connection with the third Athenian heroine, Ariadne. The form of his name in Greek is the Athenian form versus the usual Homeric form (Διόνυσος, with a short -o- vs. the usual Epic form Διώνυσος, with -ō-), and this is part of the "signature." If the whole signature is deliberate - if it is asserting its Athenian origin- the phrase containing the name Dionysus may have a double meaning. On the surface of the narrative Ariadne is killed <em>Dionusou marturiēisi</em> "on the evidence of Dionysus." In terms of an "Athenian signature" the "evidence of Dionysus" could suggest a slightly different translation, "the evidence of the word Dionysus."</p>

# Odyssey 11.436-39

<p>Odysseus characterizes the suffering attendant on the Trojan expedition—including the many deaths depicted in the <em>Iliad</em>—as a consequence of Zeus’ displeasure and the “will (βουλαί) of women.” This description substantially modifies the causal framework put forward by the <em>Iliad</em>, which presents the events it describes as the result of “the will of Zeus” (Διὸς βουλή, as in <em>Iliad</em> 1.5) alone. Odysseus’ reconfiguration of Iliadic causality reflects the distinctive vision of the <em>Odyssey</em>, which portrays female figures as exercising considerable control over events: Athena, with the support of Zeus, is the divine sponsor of the plot (see Murnaghan 2005), and the success of Odysseus’ homecoming is repeatedly represented as depending on the goodwill of various women, above all Penelope. (See also<i> Odyssey </i>2.382, 11.226).

<p>At O.11.602–604, it is said that Hēraklēs, described here as <em>autos</em> ‘himself’, O.11.602, is in Olympus, together with the immortal gods and married to Hēbē, so that the vision of Hēraklēs that is seen in Hādēs is just that, an <em>eidōlon</em> ‘vision’, at O.11.602. At I.01.004, we have seen that <em>autoi</em> ‘selves’ refers to dead bodies of heroes, to be contrasted with the word <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’, which refers to either (A) the <em>life-force </em>of heroes when they are alive or (B) the <em>disembodied conveyor of identity</em> when they are dead—as in the case of the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits at I.01.003. See the comment on I.01.003–005. At O.11.602–604, by contrast, the <em>autos</em> ‘self’ that is Hēraklēs is no longer dead but regenerated and thus immortalized. We may infer, then, that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Hēraklēs as his life-force has been reunited with his body, with his self, and that is why his <em>psūkhē </em>in Hādēs must be seen as a disembodied conveyor of his identity—as a mere <em>eidōlon</em> ‘vision’. </p>

# Odyssey 12.001-12.004

<p>Part 1.</p><p>After his sojourn in Hādēs, which is narrated in <em>Odyssey</em> 11, here at the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 12 Odysseus finally emerges from that realm of darkness and death. As Odysseus now returns from Hādēs, crossing again the circular cosmic stream of Ōkeanos at O.12.001–002 and coming back to his point of departure, that is, to the island of the goddess Circe at O.12.003, we find that this island is no longer in the Far West: instead, it is now in the Far East, where Hēlios the god of the sun has his ‘sunrises’, <em>an(a)tolai</em>, O.12.004, and where Ēōs the goddess of the dawn has her own palace, featuring a special space for her ‘choral singing-and-dancing’, <em>khoroi</em>, O.12.003–004. Before the hero’s descent into the realm of darkness and death, we saw the Ōkeanos as the absolute marker of the Far West; after his ascent into the realm of light and life, we see it as the absolute marker of the Far East (GM 237). <em>In returning to the island of Circe by crossing the circular cosmic river Ōkeanos for the second time, the hero has come full circle, experiencing sunrise after having experienced sunset</em>. Even the name of Circe may be relevant, since the form <em>Kirkē</em> may be cognate with the form <em>kirkos</em>, a variant of the noun <em>krikos</em>, meaning ‘circle, ring’ (DELG under κρίκος). As we will now see, this experience of coming full circle is a mental experience—or, to put it another way, it is a psychic experience.</p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The return of Odysseus to light and life replicates the mystical journey of the sun as it travels every night from the Far West to the Far East, and thus the hero’s return becomes a substitute for the mystical journey of a soul. This way, the <em>nostos</em> ‘return’ of Odysseus, as an epic narrative, becomes interwoven with a mystical subnarrative. While the epic narrative tells about the hero’s return to Ithaca after all the fighting at Troy and all the travels at sea, the mystical subnarrative tells about the soul’s return from darkness and death to light and life. </p><p>Part 3. </p><p>In some poetic traditions, the mystical subnarrative of the hero’s <em>nostos</em> can even be foregrounded, as in these verses of Theognis (1123–1128):</p><p>|1123 μή με κακῶν μίμνησκε· πέπονθά τοι οἷά τ’ Ὀδυσσεύς, |1124 ὅστ’ Ἀίδεω μέγα δῶμ’ ἤλυθεν ἐξαναδύς, |1125 ὃς δὴ καὶ μνηστῆρας ἀνείλατο νηλέι θυμῷ, |1126 Πηνελόπης εὔφρων κουριδίης ἀλόχου, |1127 ἥ μιν δήθ’ ὑπέμεινε φίλῳ παρὰ παιδὶ μένουσα, |1128 ὄφρα τε γῆς ἐπέβη δείλ’ ἁλίους τε μυχούς.</p><p>|1123 Do not remind me of my misfortunes! The kinds of things that happened to Odysseus have happened to me too. |1124 He came back, emerging from the great palace of Hādēs, |1125 and then killed the suitors with a pitiless heart [<em>thūmos</em>], |1126 while thinking good thoughts about his duly wedded wife Penelope, |1127 who all along waited for him and stood by their dear son |1128 while he [= Odysseus] was experiencing dangers on land and in the gaping chasms of the sea.</p><p>Part 4.</p><p>The return of Odysseus from Hādēs leads to a rebuilding of his heroic identity. Earlier in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the status of Odysseus as a hero of epic had already been reduced to nothing. As we saw in the tale of his encounter with the Cyclops, the return of Odysseus from the monster’s cave deprives him of his past identity at Troy. His epic fame can no longer depend on his power of <em>mētis</em>, ‘craft’, which had led to the invention of the Wooden Horse, which in turn had led to the destruction of Troy. After his encounter with the Cyclops, Odysseus must achieve a new epic identity as the hero of his own epic about homecoming, about his own <em>nostos</em>, but, for the moment, his confidence in his power to bring about this <em>nostos</em> is reduced to nothing. He has lost his confidence in the power of his own <em>mētis</em>, ‘craftiness’, to devise a stratagem for achieving a <em>nostos</em>. When he reaches the island of Circe and learns that this place, though it first seems familiar and reminiscent of his own island, is in fact strange and alien and antithetical to home, he despairs, as we saw at O.10.189-202.</p><p>Part 5.</p><p>Despite such moments of disorientation for Odysseus, his <em>nóos</em>, ‘thinking’, will ultimately reorient him, steering him away from his Iliadic past and toward his ultimate Odyssean future. That is, the hero’s <em>nóos</em> will makes it possible for him to achieve a <em>nostos</em>, which is not only his ‘homecoming’ but also the ‘song about a homecoming’ that is the <em>Odyssey</em>. For this song to succeed, Odysseus must keep adapting his identity by making his <em>nóos</em> fit the <em>nóos</em> of the many different characters he encounters in the course of his <em>nostos</em> in progress. In order to adapt, he must master many different forms of discourse. The epithet for this ability to adapt, as we will see, is <em>poluainos</em>, ‘having many different kinds of coded message’: that is how, as we will see, Odysseus is described by the Sirens when he sails past their island, O.12.184).</p><p>[[GN 2017.06.15 via BA 206, GMP 237, PH 236–237.]]</p>

Here we see Odysseus and his men making for Elpenor a tomb by heaping a tumulus of earth over the seafarer’s corpse and then, instead of erecting a <em>stēlē</em> or vertical ‘column’ on top, they stick his oar into the heap of earth. (What follows is epitomized from H24H §§47–50.) </p><p>  </p><p>Part 1.</p><p>The ritual procedure for making the tomb of Elpenor follows the instructions given to Odysseus during his sojourn in Hādēs, O.11.051-080; these instructions were given by Elpenor himself or, more accurately, by his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’, O.11.051, and the wording makes it explicit that the tomb to be made is a <em>sēma</em>, O.11.075.</p><p>  </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>In the light of this description, we can see that the ritual act of Odysseus when he sticks his own well-made oar into the ground at O.11.129 and sacrifices to Poseidon at O.11.130-131 points to the making of his own <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’, corresponding to the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given to him by Teiresias at O.11.126).</p><p>  </p><p>Part 3.</p><p>There are two meanings to be found in this ritual act of Odysseus, since he sticks his oar into the ground at the precise moment when the oar is no longer recognized as an oar, O.11.129. In this <em>coincidence of opposites</em>, the oar is now a winnowing shovel, O.11.128—an agricultural implement that is used for separating the grain from the chaff after the harvesting of wheat. You toss the harvested wheat up in the air, and even the slightest breeze will blow the chaff further to the side while the grain falls more or less straight down into a heap in front of you. The winnowing shovel looks exactly like an oar, but it is not an oar for agriculturists. Conversely, the oar looks exactly like the winnowing shovel, but it is not a winnowing shovel for seafarers. For Odysseus, however, this implement could be both an oar and a winnowing shovel, since he could see that the same <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ has two distinct meanings in two distinct places: what is an oar for the seafarers is a winnowing shovel for the inlanders. And, in order to recognize that one <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ could have two meanings, <em>Odysseus must travel</em>, as we see from the key wording he learned from the instructions of Teiresias. Odysseus himself uses this key wording when he retells to Penelope a retrospective story of his travels, O.23.266–268. And, as we saw at O.01.003, the travels of Odysseus throughout ‘the many cities of mortals’ were the key to his achieving his special kind of heroic consciousness, or <em>nóos</em>.</p><p>  </p><p>Part 4.</p><p>Just as the implement carried by Odysseus is one sign with two meanings, so also the picture of this implement that we see stuck into the ground is one sign with two meanings. We have already noted the first of these meanings, namely, that the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by Teiresias to Odysseus at O.11.126 is in fact the tomb of Odysseus, imagined as a heap of earth with an oar stuck into it on top, just as the tomb of the seafarer Elpenor is a heap of earth with his own oar stuck into it on top, as we just saw at O.12.14-15 and at O.11.075–078 respectively); in fact, as we saw O.11.075, this heap of earth is actually called the <em>sēma</em> of Elpenor, and the word here clearly means ‘tomb’. </p><p>  </p><p>Part 5.</p><p>Accordingly, I paraphrase the first of the two meanings as a headline, “the seafarer is dead.” As for the second of the two meanings, I propose to paraphrase it as another headline, “the harvest is complete.” Here is why: the act of sticking the shaft of a winnowing shovel, with the blade pointing upward, into a heap of harvested wheat after having winnowed away the chaff from the grain is a ritual gesture indicating that the winnower’s work is complete (as we see from the wording of Theocritus 7.155-156). And the act of sticking the shaft of an oar into the ground, again with the blade facing upward, is a ritual gesture indicating that the oarsman’s work is likewise complete—as in the case of Odysseus’ dead comrade Elpenor, whose tomb is to be a heap of earth with the shaft of his oar stuck into the top, as we see at O.11.075–078 and here at O.12.014–015. So also with Odysseus: he too will never again have to sail the seas. </p>

You went down to the House of Hādēs while you were still alive. |22 You are <em>dis-thanees</em> [= you experience death twice], whereas other mortals die only once.</p><p>Circe understands the mystical experience that Odysseus and his companions have undergone by entering Hādēs in the Far West and then returning from there in the Far East, just as the sun mystically travels from west to east during the night. That is why Circe, after Odysseus and his men arrive back on her island, addresses the whole group as <em>dis-thanees</em>, that is, ‘those who experience death twice’. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 11§61.) So, Odysseus together with his companions had died metaphorically when he went to Hādēs in <em>Odyssey</em> 11 and then he had returned to light and life in <em>Odyssey</em> 12. But O will die for real in a future that is beyond the limits of the story told in the <em>Odyssey</em> as we have it: just as the seer Teiresias had predicted it when he gave to Odysseus a <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ at O.11.126, Odysseus will die after he experiences another coincidence of opposites—while carrying the oar that becomes a winnowing shovel.  </p>

Homeric poetry is here telling a story by channeling Odysseus in the act of telling his own story, and the act of universalizing is immediately expressed. It happens at O.12.070 here: the wording says right away that the ship Argo, ‘which-is-on-the-minds-of’ (μέλουσα) humans, is an all-important subject, since it is on the minds of ‘all’ (πᾶσι) humans in the universe. The sailors of the good ship Argo faced the challenge of sailing past a most dangerous rock in the treacherous seas, and now Odysseus, admirer of the Argonauts, is faced with the same challenge in his own story. The verb <em>melein</em> ‘be on one’s mind’ is used here in the sense of referring to a song that is on the minds of all who hear it or want to hear it. See the comment on O.09.019–020.  </p>

# Odyssey 12.69-12.70

<p>The ship Argo is πᾶσι μέλουσα 'on-the-minds of all humans', because Homer himself has these things on his mind when he mentions them. This universalizing of the Argo, from the mind of the poet to the minds of all humans, makes sense only because this poetry assumes its own universal appeal as a given. </p><p>The verb μέλουσα comes from the infinitive μέλειν, which I translate with the wording 'to-be-on-the-mind-of'. The subject of this verb μέλειν is whatever is on the mind of someone. In everyday contexts, what is on the mind of someone is incidental: someone happens to be thinking about something, and so that something is on the mind of that someone. In Homeric contexts, however, whatever is on someone's mind is special and worthy of being recorded in poetry. This worthy something, then, as signaled by μέλειν, is more than just an incidental thought: it is a caring thought, a concerned thought, even a worried thought. A striking example comes at <em>Iliad</em> 6.441, when, after Andromache says to Hector that she is thinking thoughts about the uncertain future that awaits her and their child, Hector responds that 'all these things are-on-my-mind [<em>melei</em>] as well' (ἦ καὶ ἐμοὶ τάδε πάντα <span style="text-decoration: underline;">μέλει</span>). </p>

By knowing everything, they are like the Muses. The repeated word <em>idmen</em> ‘we know’ at O.10.189/191 is comparable to what the Muses say to the Narrator in Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 27/28, <em>idmen</em> ‘we know’. Also comparable is what the Narrator says to the Muses at I.02.485: <em>iste te panta</em> ‘you know everything’. By knowing everything about the Trojan War, the Sirens are like the Muses of the <em>Iliad</em>, as at I.02.485. It may be said that the Sirens are the false Muses of the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The Song of the Sirens is relevant to I.09.413, where Achilles says he will have to choose between a <em>nostos</em>, which is a safe ‘homecoming’, and the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of the poetry that will be his if he dies young at Troy. See the comment on I.09.410–416. Achilles will have to forfeit <em>nostos</em> in order to achieve his <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ as the central hero of the <em>Iliad</em>. By contrast, Odysseus must have both <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in order to merit his own heroic status in the <em>Odyssey</em> (BA 36-40). For him, the <em>nostos</em> is not only a ‘homecoming’ but also a ‘song about a homecoming’, and that song is the <em>Odyssey</em>. It is the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of that song that will be his—if his quest for a homecoming is to succeed. </p><p>Part 3. </p><p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 9§14.) The narrative of the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ of song that Odysseus earns in the <em>Odyssey</em> cannot be the <em>Iliad</em>, which means ‘tale of Troy’ (Ilion is the other name for Troy). The <em>Iliad</em> establishes Achilles as the central hero of the story of Troy, even though he failed to destroy the city—while Odysseus succeeded, by devising the stratagem of the Wooden Horse. Because of the <em>Iliad</em> tradition, “the <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus at Troy was preempted by the <em>kleos</em> of Achilles” (BA 41). Thus the <em>kleos</em> that Odysseus should get for his success in destroying Troy is elusive, by contrast with the <em>kleos</em> that Achilles gets in the <em>Iliad</em>, which is permanent. So, Odysseus cannot afford to dwell on his success at Troy, because the <em>kleos</em> he may get for that success will become permanent only if it extends into the <em>kleos</em> that he gets for achieving a successful homecoming. Odysseus, then, must get over the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p>Part 4.</p><p>As we see from the wording of the Sirens’ Song here in the <em>Odyssey</em>, O.12.184–191, the sheer pleasure of listening to a song about the destruction of Troy will be in vain if there is no <em>nostos</em>, no safe return home from the faraway world of epic heroes; and, by extension, the <em>Iliad</em> itself will become a Song of the Sirens without a successful narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> (BA [1999] xii).</p><p>Part 5.</p><p>(What follows in Parts 5 and 6 is epitomized from H24H 10§§19–20.) So, to repeat, Odysseus must get over the <em>Iliad</em>. But, to get over the <em>Iliad</em>, he must sail past it. His ongoing story, which is the <em>Odyssey</em>, must be about the seafarer who is making his way back home, not about the warrior who once fought at Troy. The <em>kleos</em> of Odysseus at Troy cannot be the master myth of the <em>Odyssey</em>, since the <em>kleos</em> of Achilles at Troy has already become the master myth of the <em>Iliad</em>. As I already noted, the <em>kleos</em> or poetic ‘glory’ of Achilles in the Iliad has preempted a <em>kleos</em> for Odysseus that centers on this rival hero’s glorious exploits at Troy. For the hero of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the ongoing <em>kleos</em> of his adventures in the course of his <em>nostos</em> is actually threatened by any past <em>kleos</em> of his adventures back at Troy. Such a <em>kleos</em> of the past in the <em>Odyssey</em> could not rival the <em>kleos</em> of the more distant past in the <em>Iliad</em>. It would be a false <em>Iliad</em>. That is why Odysseus must sail past the Island of the Sirens. The Sirens, as false Muses, tempt the hero by offering to sing for him an endless variety of songs about Troy in particular and about everything else in general. </p><p>Part 6.</p><p>The sheer pleasure of listening to the songs of the Sirens threatens not only the <em>nostos</em>, ‘homecoming’, of Odysseus, who is tempted to linger and never stop listening to the endless stories about Troy, but also the soundness of his ‘thinking’, his <em>nóos</em>. And it even threatens the ongoing song about the hero’s homecoming, that is, the <em>Odyssey</em> itself (BA [1999] xii). Accordingly, the use of the verb <em>néesthai</em> ‘return, have a homecoming’ at O.12.188 signals what is at stake for both the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ and the <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ of Odysseus, and it is no accident that these two nouns are actually both derived from that verb. </p>

# Odyssey 12.184

<p>The translations ‘of many fables’ or more simply ‘fabled’ reflect the specialized meaning of <em>ainos</em> as ‘fable’. In addressing Odysseus this way, the Sirens are recognizing the hero’s fame as a master of <em>ainos</em>, which is a form of speech that can more generally be described as a <em>coded message</em> (on which see the comment on I.09.524–599). So, Odysseus is recognized as ‘able to speak about many things <em>in code</em>’. Such coded speech is by nature ‘riddling’, as we see from the meaning of <em>ainigma</em> ‘enigma, riddle’, which is a derivative of <em>ainos</em>. In order to survive, Odysseus must master many different forms of discourse, many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>. That is why he is addressed as <em>poluainos</em> ‘having many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>’ by the Sirens here when he sails past their island, O.12.184. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 10§43.) Even the transparent meaning of Polyphemus, <em>Poluphēmos</em>, which is the name of the Cyclops blinded by Odysseus, foretells the hero’s mastery of the <em>ainos</em>. As an adjective, <em>poluphēmos</em> means ‘having many different kinds of things said’, derived from the noun <em>phēmē</em>, ‘thing said’, as at O.20.100 and at O.20.105. See the comment at O.20.098-121, [HR]3§23. This adjective <em>poluphēmos</em> ‘having many different kinds of things said’ is applied as an epithet to the singer <em>Phēmios</em>, O.22.376, portrayed as singing songs that have many different meanings: see the comments at O.01.342 and O.02.035 (see also BA 17). In the case of Polyphemus, the very meaning of his name, which conveys the opposite of the meaning conveyed by the false name of Odysseus, <em>Outis</em>, ‘no one’, foretells the verbal mastery of the hero who blinded the monster.  </p>

Bringing these festivities to a spectacular close, Alkinoos the king of the Phaeacians slaughters a sacrificial ox to the god Zeus, and this animal sacrifice is the cue for Demodokos to emerge once again as the lead singer in the midst of a festive crowd. </p><p>  </p><p>Part 2.</p><p>I note that the wording at O.13.027 is exactly the same as at O.04.017. See the comment on O.04.015–019. More important, we see the same wording also at I.18.604, which is the line that shows a part of the longer version of I.18.603–606. See the comment on I.18.603–604–(605–)606. In each one of these three lines that I just noted, O.13.027 and O.04.017 and I.18.604, a solo singer is shown, but the individuated soloist is leading into a choral song combined with dance, as signaled by the word <em>melpesthai</em> in all three contexts. This word, as we have seen, combines the idea of singing with the idea of dancing—that is, choral dancing. That is why I translate <em>melpesthai</em> in a hyphenated format, ‘singing-and-dancing’. See also the comments on I.18.603–604–(605–)606 and O.04.015–019.</p><p>  </p><p>Part 3. </p><p>The text of O.13.024–028 is a most decisive piece of comparative evidence validating the authenticity of the corresponding passage in the longer version of I.18.603–606. Both of these two passages show an individuated lead singer in the midst of a festive crowd surrounding a choral performance that brings delight to all. Both in O.13.027 and in I.18.604, the decisive word that shows the interaction of the individuated lead singer with choral performance is melpesthai ‘sing-and-dance’. (The verb <em>melpesthai</em> ‘sing-and-dance’ at I.18.604 is picked up by the corresponding noun <em>molpē</em> ‘singing-and-dancing’ at I.18.606.) But the passage at O.13.024–028 occludes any direct mention of dancers, thus differing from the corresponding passage in the longer version of I.18.603–606, which highlights two individuated dancers as well as a chorus. Conversely, the passage in the shorter version of I.18.603–606 occludes any direct mention of a singer, thus differing from the corresponding passage in O.13.024–028 here, which highlights Demodokos as an individuated lead singer. </p><p>  </p><p>Part 4.</p><p>The decisive evidence of this passage, O.13.024–028, is missing from the reportage of Athenaeus (5.181c) about the editorial decisions of Aristarchus concerning O.04.015–019 and I.18.603–606. And it is missing also from the argumentations of some who build theories about various kinds of textual interpolation. As I argued in the comment on I.18.603–604–(605–)606, the evidence of the wording at I.18.604–605 indicates that both the shorter and the longer versions result from formulaic variation.  </p>

<p>The sacrificing of an ox to Zeus here marks this god as the ultimate hymnic subject of the festive performances starting with the three songs of Demodokos in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 and capped by the narrative of Odysseus himself in <em>Odyssey</em> 9–12. As we see most clearly in the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, the invoked divinity who presides over a given festival is the hymnic subject of the hymn (MoM 4§82). We know from Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3 that Zeus was the hymnic subject of the <em>Homēridai</em>, notional descendants of Homer, who performed the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> in relay (HPC 240, MoM 4§§99.4, 99.5). Accordingly, I interpret the sacrifice to Zeus here at O.13.024–025 as a signature, as it were, of the <em>Homēridai</em>. See also the comment that introduces Rhapsody 9.  </p>

The very idea of <em>consciousness</em> as conveyed by <em>nóos</em> is derived from the metaphor of <em>returning to light from darkness</em>, as encapsulated in the moment of <em>waking up from sleep</em>, or of <em>regaining consciousness after losing consciousness</em>, that is, of ‘coming to’. See the comment on O.01.003; also on O.09.082–104. This metaphor of <em>coming to</em> is at work not only in the meaning of <em>nóos</em> in the sense of <em>consciousness</em> but also in the meaning of <em>nostos</em> in the sense of <em>returning from darkness and death to light and life</em>. See the comment on O.01.005. Remarkably, these two meanings converge at one single point in the master myth of the <em>Odyssey</em>. It happens here at O.13.078-095, when Odysseus finally reaches his homeland of Ithaca. Odysseus has been sailing home on a ship provided by the Phaeacians, against the will of the god Poseidon, and the hero falls into a deep sleep that most resembles death itself, O.13.079–080). This sleep makes him momentarily unconscious: he ‘forgets’, as expressed by the verb <em>lēth</em>-, O.13.092, all the <em>algea</em>, ‘pains’, of his past journeys through so many different cities of so many different people, O.13.090-091. Then, at the very moment when the ship reaches the shore of Ithaca, the hero’s homeland, the morning star appears, heralding the coming of dawn, O.13.093–095. The Phaeacians hurriedly leave Odysseus on the beach where they placed him, still asleep, when they landed, O.13.119, and, once they sail away, he wakes up there, O.13.187. So, the moment of the hero’s homecoming, which is synchronized with the moment of sunrise, is now further synchronized with a moment of awakening from a sleep that most resembles death.  </p>

# Excursus on Odyssey 13.158

<p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2001:84–91, where bibliography is provided about the various different views concerning this verse.)</p><p>According to the version of O.13.158 that survives only by way of Aristophanes, the future of the Phaeacians is not at all closed off. It remains open-ended, extending into the “present” when the epic is being narrated. The threatening mountain will not block the harbor of the Phaeacians from the outside world —if we read <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’ instead of <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’ at O.13.158.</p><p>Two questions immediately come to mind. First, how could this different version fit the overall narrative of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>? Second, is the textual basis of this version “legitimate”? </p><p>I already addressed the first question in the comments above, taking a close look at the logic of the narrative after O.13.158. Here I turn to the second question about O.13.158: is the textual basis of the different version featuring <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’ really “legitimate”? We can now add a related question: if it is legitimate, then does that delegitimize the version featuring <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’?</p><p>Whether we need to choose one or the other variant depends on the way we look at Homeric poetry. If this poetry is merely a static text, then we are indeed forced to make a choice. If, however, we view Homeric poetry as a living system—an oral tradition that evolves ultimately into the textual tradition inherited by the Alexandrian editors—then we do not have to choose whenever we see a variation. Rather, as I will now go on to argue, the choices were already being made by Homeric poetry itself, which could opt for different variants in different phases of its own evolution. </p><p>My reasoning here derives from an overall “evolutionary model” that I have worked out as a general way of accounting for the making of Homeric poetry (PasP 109–114 and HQ 29–112). In terms of this model, as I now plan to argue, the living and evolving oral tradition of Homeric poetry itself allowed for a choice either to seal off its own past from the present time of narration or to reach into this present time and thereby make its presence fully manifest.</p><p>According to the narrative option linked with the first of our two variants from O.13.158, <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’, the outlook is hopeless for the Phaeacians, since Poseidon&#x27;s plan to seal off the city of the Phaeacians has been restated by Zeus and is therefore tantamount to the Will of Zeus, which the Homeric tradition conventionally equates with the way things ultimately turn out in epic narrative, as at I.01.005. At the beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, however, Zeus himself undercuts the equation of epic plot with the Will of Zeus, O.01.032–034. That is, there are differences in shades of meaning between the Iliadic and the Odyssean perspectives on the Will of Zeus as the plot of epic (PH 241–242). </p><p>According to the narrative option linked with the second variant <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’, the outlook is still hopeful. After all, at an earlier point in the narrative, O.13.144–145, we can see a way out when Zeus tells Poseidon to exact any punishment he pleases ‘if any human dishonors you not at all’ (ἀνδρῶν δ᾿ εἴ περ τίς σε . . . | οὔ τι τίει), O.13.143–144. The context is this: Poseidon has been angrily questioning Zeus, calling on him to explain the Will of Zeus (Διὸς δ᾿ ἐξείρετο βουλήν), O.13.127. That is, Poseidon calls on Zeus to explain the overall plot of the narrative—now that the Phaeacians have conveyed Odysseus back home to Ithaca. How can I be honored among the gods, Poseidon plaintively asks Zeus, ‘when the Phaeacians do not honor me at all?’ (ὅτε με βροτοὶ οὔ τι τίουσι | Φαίηκες), O.13.129–130. But then, as we have already seen in the comments, the story goes on to say that the Phaeacians will indeed initiate a remedy after the first disaster by proceeding to honor Poseidon with sacrifice in order to avert the second disaster, which is, the envelopment of their harbor by a huge mountain. </p><p>The narrative option that I link with the variant <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’, according to which the Phaeacians are to be spared the second disaster of an all-enveloping mountain, depends on whether this variant as adduced by Aristophanes of Byzantium in place of <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’ at O.13.158 is a genuine <em>formulaic</em> variant or only a <em>textual</em> variant. If it is the latter, then <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’ may be just an editorial conjecture. That possibility would severely reduce the chances for arguing that <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’ is a genuine alternative to <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’. In what follows, however, I will argue against that possibility on several levels.</p><p>From an analysis of the formulaic system in which <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; is embedded, this form can be justified as a functioning element in that system, just as the form <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; is a functioning element: in other words, <em>mēde</em> and <em>mega de</em> can be considered compositional alternatives in the formulaic system of Homeric diction.</p><p>As Leonard Muellner points out in a message written 1998.03.10 to me and to Chad E. Turner, <em>mega de</em> ‘and a huge…’ at O.13.177 is syntactically and formulaically parallel to <em>mēde</em> ‘but not’ at O.13.183. In a message written 1998.02.03, Turner had pointed out to me that the metrical placement of <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’  at O.13.198 is singular (although there are cases where this word straddles the last syllable of a spondee and the first syllable of a dactyl in the third and fourth feet, he finds no other cases in the second and third feet). But the formulaic system is capable of generating rare forms and combinations. For a striking example, we may compare the unique attestation of <em>mēden</em> at I.18. 500: here is a word that is found this one and only time in the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> put together, and yet it can be shown to be <em>formulaic</em>. See Muellner 1976:101–102, 106.</p><p>Moreover, there is immediate contextual as well as formulaic evidence to support the argument that <em>mēde</em> ‘but not…’ is a functioning compositional variant in the formulaic system. Let us consider the wording of Zeus in his answer to Poseidon&#x27;s angry questioning at O.13.145:</p><p>|145 ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις καί τοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ</p><p>|145 Do as you wish and as was pleasing to your heart.</p><p>This open-ended wording of Zeus matches formulaically the wording of Alkinoos, when he had originally “quoted” the prophecy of his father, O.08.570–571:</p><p>|570 ὣς ἀγόρευ᾿ ὁ γέρων. τὰ δέ κεν θεὸς ἢ τελέσειεν, |571 ἤ κ᾿ ἀτέλεστ᾿ εἴη, ὥς οἱ φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ</p><p>|570 That is what the old man said. And the god [Poseidon] could either bring these things to fulfillment |571 or they could be left unfulfilled, however it was pleasing to his heart.</p><p>The formulation of Zeus, then, in leaving it still undecided whether or not the Phaeacians are to be ‘enveloped’, can be used as evidence to argue that <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; is indeed a genuine compositional alternative to <em>mega de </em>&#x27;and a huge...&#x27;.</p><p>As for the possibility that <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; is an emendation based on an editorial conjecture, my own cumulative work on Homeric variants as adduced by the three great Alexandrian editors of Homer (Zenodotus, Aristophanes, and Aristarchus) leaves me skeptical, since I find that these editors normally do not make emendations without manuscript evidence (PasP 107–152). </p><p>In making the specific argument that both variants <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; and <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; are genuine compositional alternatives, I return to my general argument that Homeric poetry is not a static text but a slowly evolving system. In terms of this general argument, the variant mega de produces a narrative closure for the Phaeacians: their fate is sealed. The variant <em>mēde</em>, however, produces an outcome that is open-ended.</p><p>These two variants, I contend, reflect different phases in the evolution of Homeric poetry. Let us begin with the variant <em>mega de </em>&#x27;and a huge...&#x27;, the context of which can be linked with a relatively more Panhellenic phase of epic. (On the relativity of Panhellenism—despite the absolutist implications of the term—as a cultural impulse, see <em>PH</em> p. 53.) I have defined this phase elsewhere as one that “concentrates on traditions that tend to be common to most locales and peculiar to none” (PH 54). The Panhellenic phases of epic make contact with the “present” time of narration by shading over any “local color” that might distract from the widest possible range of ways to visualize this “present” (PH 53). A Panhellenic version, then, will tend to universalize the concerns of the present.</p><p>But there are also other, less Panhellenic, ways for epic to make contact with the “present” time in which narration happens: the “local color” can be highlighted, though only at the cost of narrowing the range of ways to visualize this “present.” The context of the variant <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; can be linked with such a relatively less Panhellenic phase of epic. This variant makes contact with the epic “present” in a less universalized and more localized way. One focus of localization is historical Corcyra, modern-day Corfù. </p><p>The fact is, the Corcyraeans of the Classical period claimed to be residents of the land of the Phaeacians, as we know from a remark of Thucydides (1.25.4); from another remark of his, we know also that they worshipped King Alkinoos as their local cult hero (3.70.4). </p><p>In O.13.155–158, we hear how the Phaeacians will one day look out at their harbor and see their returning ship suddenly turn into a rock, and we hear also how that fabulous petrified ship will continue to be a most wondrous sight for future generations of humanity to see and to keep on seeing for all time to come. There are references to this “real-life” rock in Pliny (<em>Natural History</em>) 4.53 and Eustathius (Commentary on <em>Odyssey</em> vol. II p. 44 line 27), and to this day the “petrified ship” remains a most celebrated tourist attraction for visitors to Corfù. But the essential point is, the reference to this rock is already there in the <em>Odyssey</em>—that is, in a version of the <em>Odyssey</em> that says <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; instead of <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; at O.13.158.</p><p>The identity of the Corcyraeans as descendants of the Phaeacians depends on the Will of Zeus as he formulates it at O.13.155–158, and it depends especially on the variant <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; of O.13.158, which yields an open-ended narrative that reaches directly into the “present” of the Classical period and beyond. </p><p>As a political and cultural fact of life, the self-identification of the Corcyraeans with the Phaeacians has been dated as far back as the eighth century BCE, when the island was settled by colonists from Eretria and, soon thereafter, from Corinth (Plutarch <em>Greek Questions</em> 293a; further sources analyzed in Frame 257n158). The variant represented by <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; at O.13.158 may be just as early, and in fact it may be the vehicle for expressing just such a political and cultural fact of life. This is not to say that the other variant represented by <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; at O.13.158 may not be just as early. It is only to say that both variants were still available to the Homeric tradition of epic as it evolved during the pre-Classical period. In such an early period, the affirming—or the denying—of a claim of descent from the Phaeacians was essential not just poetically but also politically and culturally. It really mattered then, and it continued to matter well into the Classical period of the fifth century and beyond, as we have seen from the remark of Thucydides (1.25.4, 3.70.4) about the Corcyraeans’ claim that they inhabited the land of the Phaeacians, whose king, Alkinoos, they worshipped as their local hero. </p><p>In the Hellenistic period of the Alexandrian editors of Homer, by contrast, the question of choosing <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; or <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; would have mattered purely from a poetical rather than a political or cultural point of view. The Corcyraeans’ claims to the land of the Phaeacians would not be a major concern any more, at least not politically. But it would still really matter in another way: was the petrified ship of the Phaeacians a figment of the poetic imagination, walled off in the epic past, or is it the same thing as the real-life rock at the entrance to the harbor of Corcyra, accessible to all humanity in the contemporary Hellenic world? The disagreement between Aristarchus and Aristophanes over the choice of <em>mega de</em> &#x27;and a huge...&#x27; or <em>mēde</em> &#x27;but not...&#x27; respectively must have centered on such questions. One way, we see a beautiful snapshot from the enchanted imaginary world of the epic past. The other way, we see a comparably beautiful vista in the enchanting touristic world of the non-epic present, still anchored in the permanence of the epic past. Either way, petrified ship or scenic rock, what we see is a beloved cultural landmark of Hellenism.</p><p>All this is not to say that we must ultimately choose between these two versions of seeing things Homeric. It is only to say that both variants were still available to the Homeric tradition of epic as it evolved into the Classical period and beyond. And it is to ponder the power of epic either to close down or to open up its pathways to the present. The fate of the Phaeacians in conveying the heroic past to the present depends on that power of Homeric dimensions. </p>

This different version was disputed by the later Alexandrian editor Aristarchus of Samothrace: he preferred the version of O.13.158 that I showed earlier, which is the one that survives in the medieval manuscript tradition. According to the version that survives only by way of Aristophanes, the future of the Phaeacians is not at all closed off. It remains open-ended, extending into the “present” when the epic is being narrated. For more, see the Excursus at the end of this section of comments on Rhapsody 13. </p>

<p>|178 ὣς ἀγόρευ᾿ ὁ γέρων. τὰ δὲ δὴ νῦν πάντα τελεῖται. |179 ἀλλ᾿ ἄγεθ᾿, ὥς ἂν ἐγὼ εἴπω, πειθώμεθα πάντες.</p><p>|178 That is what the old man said. And now you and I see that all these things are being brought to fulfillment. |179 But come, let us all comply with exactly what I am about to say.</p><p>The audience of the <em>Odyssey</em> already knows this prophecy as recapitulated in O.13.173–177, because Alkinoos had already &quot;quoted&quot; it to Odysseus at O.08.565-569. The textual transmission of O.08.565–569 and O.13 173–177 leaves the two passages matching almost exactly, word for word. There is some degree of non-matching, though: for example, the ship is εὐεργέα ‘well-built’ in most manuscripts at O.08.567 vs. περικαλλέα ‘very beautiful’ in most manuscripts at O.13.175, while the mutually alternative forms are attested in a minority of manuscripts at both places. In terms of oral poetics, such variation may be justified even where the “quoting” of a character&#x27;s words happens to be a narrative requirement of the composition, as it is here. At that earlier point in the narrative, however, Alkinoos had said something in addition, which he does not say now (O.08.570–571):</p><p>|570 ὣς ἀγόρευ᾿ ὁ γέρων. τὰ δέ κεν θεὸς ἢ τελέσειεν, |57 ἤ κ᾿ ἀτέλεστ᾿ εἴη, ὥς οἱ φῦλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ</p><p>|570 That is what the old man said. And the god [Poseidon] could either bring these things to fulfillment |571 or they could be left unfulfilled, however it was pleasing to his heart.</p><p>Now, instead of “repeating” this part of the old man&#x27;s prophecy, Alkinoos commands the Phaeacians to take immediate action, as we see from the wording of O.13.178–179, as quoted and translated above. When Alkinoos had first “quoted” the prophecy of his father at O.08.570–571, the “quotation” had left a loophole: Poseidon may or may not bring ‘these things’ to fulfillment, as he wishes. But now at O.13.178–179 there is the greatest urgency, and Alkinoos exclaims hyperbolically that ‘all these things <em>are</em> being brought to fulfillment’. The rhetorical point of this hyperbole is to motivate the Phaeacians to take immediate action. Even though the half-hopeful words of Alkinoos at O.08.570–571 are not repeated but are replaced by the increasingly desperate words of O.13.178–179, there is still a trace of hope—provided that the Phaeacians take immediate action by following the emergency orders of Alkinoos, which are formulated in the verses that immediately follow, O.13.180–182.  </p>

<p>So, what will happen to the Phaeacians <em>according to the narrative</em>? We cannot be completely certain. The Homeric narrative about the Phaeacians breaks off here at O.13.187, at the very moment when they are offering sacrifice and praying to Poseidon to take pity on them. The narrative break takes place most abruptly, dramatically, and even exceptionally—at mid-verse. In the first part of the verse at O.13.187, the Phaeacians are last seen standing around the sacrificial altar; in the second part of the verse, Odysseus has just woken up in Ithaca. A new phase of the hero’s experiences has just begun in the “real” world of Ithaca.  </p>

# Odyssey 13.287-290

<p>When Odysseus arrives back in Ithaka in <em>Odyssey </em>13, he encounters Athene in the shape of young shepherd. After Odysseus lies to her about his identity, Athene reacts with a smile and another transformation:

ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,

χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξε· δέμας δ' ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ

καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ·

&nbsp;

So he spoke, and the goddess gray-eyed Athene smiled,

and she stroke him with her hand. And she took on the shape of a woman

beautiful and tall and skilled in beautiful handiworks,

and speaking to him she addressed him in winged words.

&nbsp;

Some scholars have interpreted this transformation as the goddess revealing herself to the hero in her true form (e.g., Stanford 1948, <em>ad</em> 13.289; Heubeck 1988-1992, <em>ad </em>13.288), but as Pucci argues, it is unlikely that Odysseus sees the goddess as she really is (Pucci 1986:7-28). The diction of the passage makes clear that Athene’s appearance “in the shape of a beautiful woman” is as much a disguise as the others she adopts elsewhere: as the poet tells us, “she took on (ἤϊκτο) the shape of a woman.”

The formulaic language to describe the goddess’ reaction and transformation has both erotic and maternal connotations. The formula “and she/he stroked him/her with her/his hand” appears seven times in Homeric epic, always to describe intimate moments between mother and child or between lovers. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the phrase is mostly used to described mother and child (1.361, 5.372, 23.127) and once of husband and wife (6.484-5). In the <em>Odyssey</em> the phrase occurs two other times: Menelaos smiles and strokes Telemachos in a fatherly manner (4.610), and there is perhaps a maternal aspect to Athene’s concern for Odysseus, but the encounter is not without sexual undercurrents, which are also present in the only other Odyssean instance of the phrase, which involves Kalypso smiling and stroking Odysseus (5.180-1).

When Athene strokes Odysseus, the erotic tenor of her gesture is made evident in both her physical transformation and the conversation that follows, which centers on the like-mindedness of the goddess and the hero, a quality Odysseus praises as the basis of a good marriage (<em>Odyssey </em>6.183). Athene chooses an appearance that is particularly appropriate to this moment of intimacy between goddess and her mortal protégé: the shape of a seductive woman, beautiful and skilled at handiworks, or in short and as the Greek <em>gunê</em> also denotes, a perfect wife endowed with the most desirable qualities. The encounter between goddess and hero in <em>Odyssey </em>8 is thus replete with motifs—an encounter with a beautiful female divinity in the countryside, a shrine of the nymphs—usually associated with stories of love between goddesses and men, and Odysseus in this scene is depicted as the notional lover of the goddess, or as a nympholept (<em>numpholeptos</em>).

<p>Now that he has finally returned to his homeland of Ithaca, Odysseus must accomplish another kind of return: he must be restored to kingship. Such a restoration, however, must start from the bottom up. The goddess Athena, his ultimate benefactor but occasional antagonist, has made Odysseus seem to be base on the outside, hiding his inner moral nobility. Only those who are likewise morally noble will be able to read, as it were, the hero’s true nature. Meanwhile, the coded tales told by Odysseus point toward the truth of his kingship—without revealing it outright. A telling example here in Rhapsody 14 is the second Cretan tale told by Odysseus: it is about a Cretan princeling, not unlike the dapper figure we see in the romanticized restoration of a Minoan fresco as featured in the cover-illustration for Rhapsody 14.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Knossos_frise2_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Minoan—probably Neopalatial—fresco commonly known as the “Lily Prince.” Whatever the exact type of this personage (perhaps a crowned acrobat, according to the interpretation of Maria Shaw), the Lily Prince is certainly a Minoan of elite standing.

<p>The wording at O.14.124–125 refers indirectly to itinerant poets/singers who are ready to adapt the content of their poetry/song to whatever the local audience expects to hear as its own local truth-value. It is as if such poets/singers were ‘lying’, as expressed at O.14.125 by the verb <em>pseudesthai</em>, which is contrasted here in this line with the adjective <em>alēthe</em>- ‘true’. Such itinerant poets/singers are described here as if they were wanderers in general who are ready to adapt the content of whatever they say to the standards of whomever they encounter in a given locale. By implication, those standards represent the real truth, while the mental process of adapting the truth is the equivalent of lying. Wandering beggars are like that: they will lie in order to please those who might give them food to express their pleasure. By implication, hunger for food in the stomach drives the poet as guest to say what his host wants to hear. The poet, then, is dependent on the patronage of his local audiences.

# Odyssey 14.199

<p>ἐκ μὲν Κρητάων γένος εὔχομαι εὐρειάων</p><p>I say solemnly that I was born and raised in Crete, the place that reaches far and wide</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from Nagy 2017.04.11 5§§27–28.) Odysseus, disguising himself as a Cretan princeling, begins with a statement about his origins. He says he is from Crete. In the singular, <em>Krētē</em> refers to the island of Crete. But here at O.14.199 we see the plural <em>Krêtai</em>, which cannot mean a multiplicity of islands named Crete. There is no such thing. Rather, we see here an elliptic plural, meaning ‘Crete and everything that belongs to it’. And of course whatever belongs to Crete are all the Aegean islands and lands controlled by the thalassocracy of Crete (HTL 163–164, following Muellner 1976:70). At O.19.178, we will see a pronoun that refers to Crete, and, like the noun <em>Krêtai</em> here at O.14.199, that pronoun too appears not in the singular but in the plural. So, again at O.19.178, we will see an elliptic plural. Also, in the comment on O.07.078–081, I noted a parallel example: it is the elliptic plural <em>Athênai</em>, which means ‘<em>Athēnē</em> and everything that belongs to it’. My translation here shows ‘it’ instead of ‘her’ for a simple reason: the fact is, the singular form <em>Athēnē</em> refers not only to the goddess Athena but also to the place that she personifies. As we see at O.07.080, the noun <em>Athēnē</em> in the singular can refer not only to the goddess Athena but also to the place that she controls, which was primarily the acropolis of Athens. So, to put that singular form into the plural, which is an elliptic plural, is a way of referring to all the places controlled by the acropolis of Athens. Besides <em>Athênai</em> in the sense of ‘Athens’, other such elliptic plurals include <em>Mukênai</em> ‘Mycenae’ and <em>Thêbai</em> ‘Thebes’. See the comment on O.07.078–081 (see also, again, HTL 163-164). On ellipsis in general, see the comment on I.04.196; also on I.06.209, I.07.015–017.  </p>

# Odyssey 14.508

<p>Eumaios compliments the discourse of Odysseus, calling it a fine example of an <em>ainos</em>. Here the meaning of <em>ainos</em> can be interpreted in a general poetic sense, as &#x27;coded words&#x27;-a ‘coded message’. But there is also a specific poetic sense that is conveyed by the same word: an <em>ainos</em> can be festive, highlighting the merriment of song and dance. The same kind of festivity is formalized also in the victory odes of Pindar, where the medium of the odes can refer to itself by way of the same word, ainos, as we see for example in the case of <em>Olympian</em> 11.7. See also the general comment on O.09.003–011 and the specific comment there on the word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’ at O.09.006. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer again here to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198).  </p>

# Odyssey 15.001-009

<p>(What follows is epitomized from Nagy 2017.04.11 5§§29–31.) In the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, the Minoan-Mycenaean world is linked more directly to Sparta than to Crete. To make this point, I start with the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 15, where the goddess Athena appears in an epiphany to Telemachus at Sparta. As Athena tells Telemachus at O.15.001–009, it is time for the young hero to conclude his visit at Sparta and to go back home to Ithaca. I highlight the fact that Sparta here is described here at O.15.001 as <em>eurukhoros</em> (εἰς εὐρύχορον Λακεδαίμονα), meaning ‘having a wide dancing-place’. I see here a Minoan-Mycenaean signature. Relevant is the word <em>Kallikhoron</em>, which is explained this way in the dictionary of Hesychius: Καλλίχορον· ἐν Κνωσσῷ ἐπὶ τῷ τῆς Ἀριάδνης τόπῳ ‘<em>Kallikhoron</em> was the name of the place of Ariadne in Knossos’. And the meaning of this ‘place of Ariadne’, <em>Kallikhoron</em>, is ‘the dancing-place that is beautiful’. It is most relevant to highlight here the fact that the word <em>khoros</em> can designate either the ‘place’ where singing and dancing takes place or the group of singers and dancers who perform at that place. Such a beautiful place, as we already saw in the comment on I.18.590–606, is made visible by the divine smith Hephaistos when he creates the ultimate masterpiece of visual art, the Shield of Achilles. At I.18.593–606, we see in action the singing and dancing that happens in the picturing of the divine place, the word for which is khoros, I.18.590. And the prima donna for such singing and dancing can be visualized as the girl Ariadne, for whom Daedalus had made the ultimate place for song and dance, I.18.592.  </p>

# Odyssey 15.1-3

<p>At O.13.439–440 it was said that the goddess Athena, after parting with Odysseus on the island of Ithaca, ‘next’ went off to Sparta in order to connect with Telemachus there. The moment of that connection, which was going to happen ‘next’, was expressed by way of the adverb <em>epeita</em>, O.13.439. Now at O.15.001–003 this moment that had been destined to happen ‘next’ is finally at hand, and we see the goddess arriving at Sparta, where she will make it possible for Telemachus to connect mentally with his own <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ to Ithaca, O.15.003. Essential here at O.15.03 is the use of the verb <em>hupo-mnē-</em>, meaning ‘mentally connect’. The same verb is used in a comparable context at O.01.322. See the comment on O.01.320–322. Here at O.15.001–003, Telemachus will mentally connect not only with the idea of his own homecoming but also with the song of that homecoming, which will merge with the song of his father’s homecoming. Telemachus needs to be mentally connected to his own <em>nostos</em> not only in the sense of ‘homecoming’ and ‘song of homecoming’ but also, more mystically, ‘return to light and life’. On this mystical meaning, see the comment on O.01.005, where this noun <em>nostos</em> is explained as meaning etymologically a ‘return’ or a ‘coming-back’, derived from the verb-root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’, which has a deeper meaning as well: ‘come to’, in the sense of ‘come back to consciousness’. The noun <em>nostos</em> itself, meaning ‘homecoming’, likewise has a deeper meaning: ‘coming back to light and life’. Etymologically related to this noun <em>nostos</em> in the sense of ‘coming back to light and life’ is the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, which has the deeper meaning of ‘coming to’ in the sense of ‘coming back to consciousness’. As I argued in the comment on O.13.078–095, the idea of ‘coming to’ as embedded in the noun <em>nostos</em> is activated at the moment when Odysseus comes home to Ithaca: there he wakes up from a death-like sleep at the precise moment when the sun rises. To experience such a <em>nostos</em> as a ‘homecoming’, as I also argued in the same comment, is to experience a symbolic ‘return to light and life’, and the <em>Odyssey</em> as a ‘song of homecoming’ is such a <em>nostos</em>. Here at O.15.001–003, we see that the son of Odysseus must likewise experience a <em>nostos</em>, expressed here at O.15.003 not only by the noun <em>nostos</em> but also by the verb <em>néesthai</em>, derived from the root *<em>nes</em>-. This line, O.15.003, shows that the song of this <em>nostos</em>, of this homecoming, is meant to merge with the song of the father’s homecoming. See also the comment on O.01.088–089.  </p>

# Odyssey 15.247

<p>Here as also at O.15.253, it is said explicitly that the hero Amphiaraos died in the war of the Seven against Thebes. See also the note on O.15.253 (details in BA 204). (What follows is epitomized from H24H 15§34.) In the myth about the death of Amphiaraos as retold by Pausanias (1.34.2), the hero is riding back home on his war chariot after the defeat of the Seven against Thebes, when suddenly the earth opens up underneath and swallows him—together with his speeding chariot and horses and all—and, at the spot where this engulfment happened, there is a <em>hieron</em>, ‘sacred space’, where worshippers of the hero come to consult him, though Pausanias reports that there is some disagreement about matching the place of the ritual consultations with the actual place of the mythical engulfment. In any case, I propose that the engulfment of Amphiaraos by the earth signals not only his death but also his subsequent return from death as a cult hero. Here at O.15.247 and at O.15.253, the death of Amphiaraos after the expedition against Thebes is made explicit, though it is only implicit in the references to the engulfment of this same hero as narrated in the songs of Pindar: Olympian 6.14; <em>Nemean</em> 9.24-27, 10.8-9. The poetic reticence we see in Pindar’s songs about mentioning the actual death of Amphiaraos at the moment of his engulfment by the earth is a sign, I also propose, of a keen awareness about the subsequent resurrection of the hero (BA 154, 204).  </p>

# Odyssey 15.250-15.251

<p>Here at O.15.250–251, Ēōs the goddess of the dawn abducts the beautiful young hero Kleitos by way of ‘snatching’ him away, as expressed by the verb <em>harpazein</em> ‘snatch, seize’. The picturing of such an abduction is part of an overall mythological complex that I analyzed in some detail in GMP 242–245. I epitomize that analysis in what follows:</p><p>Part 1. </p><p>Here is an inventory of verbs expressing the abduction of beautiful heroes by divinities:</p><p>A. Ēōs abducts Kleitos, here at O.15.250: <em>hḗrpasen</em> ‘snatched’</p><p>B. Ēōs abducts Tithōnos, <em>Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218; <em>hḗrpasen</em> ‘snatched’ (on Ēōs and Tithōnos, see already the comment at O.05.001–002)</p><p>C. Ēōs abducts Orion, O.05.121: <em>héleto</em> ‘seized’ </p><p>D. Ēōs abducts Kephalos, Euripides <em>Hippolytus</em> 455: <em>an-hḗrpasen</em> ‘snatched up’</p><p>E. Aphrodite abducts Phaethon (son of Kephalos), Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 990: <em>anereipsaménē</em> ‘snatching up’.</p><p>Part 2. </p><p>I draw attention here to a parallelism found in another case of abduction, where <em>Zeus abducts Ganymedes</em>. The parallelism is explicit in the <em>Hymn to Aphrodite</em>, where Aphrodite herself mentions the abduction of Ganymedes by Zeus at lines 202-217 and the abduction of Tithonos by Ēōs at lines 218-238 as precedents for her own seduction of the beautiful hero Anchises. In the <em>Iliad</em>, we find a further detail about the myth of Ganymedes: the gods abduct him for Zeus ‘on account of his beauty, so that he may be with the immortals’, I.20.235 (κάλλεος εἵνεκα οἷο, ἵν’ ἀθανάτοισι μετείη). So also here at O.15.250–251: when Ēōs abducts Kleitos, it is for the same reason: ‘on account of his beauty, so that he may be with the immortals’ (κάλλεος εἵνεκα οἷο, ἵν’ ἀθανάτοισι μετείη). These thematic parallelisms of Ganymedes/Tithōnos and Ganymedes/Kleitos are relevant to the fact that the verb used in the <em>Iliad</em> to describe how the gods abducted Ganymedes is <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’, I.20.234. This verb <em>an-ēreípsanto</em>, used here as an aorist indicative, corresponds to the aorist participle <em>an-ereipsaménē</em> ‘snatching up’, which designates how Aphrodite abducted the beautiful hero Phaethon (son of Kephalos) in Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 990. But how are we to imagine this divine action of ‘snatching up’ a beautiful hero? The answer to this question is signaled at line 208 of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em>, where the verb that is used to describe the abduction of Ganymedes is <em>an-hḗrpase</em> ‘snatched up’, line 208—and where the subject of the verb is <em>áella</em> ‘gust of wind’. The verb <em>an-hḗrpase</em> ‘snatched up’ at line 208 is coextensive with <em>hḗrpase</em> at line 202—where the subject of this verb is specifically Zeus himself, to be contrasted with the more general <em>theoí</em> ‘gods’, subject of <em>anēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’ at I.20.234. Not only in the case of <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’ with reference to the abduction of Ganymedes at I.20.234 but also in every other Homeric case of <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’, the subject of this verb refers to gusts of wind. In such contexts, we can see that <em>thúella</em> ‘gust of wind’ can be used as a synonym of <em>áella</em> ‘gust of wind’. When Penelope bewails the unknown fate of the absent Telemachus, she says that it was <em>thúellai</em> ‘gusts of wind’ that <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’ her son, O.04.727. Further, when Telemachus bewails the unknown fate of the absent Odysseus, he says that it was <em>hárpuiai</em> ‘snatching winds, Harpies’ that <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’ his absent father, O.01.241. The same expression is used when Eumaios bewails the unknown fate of the absent Odysseus, O.14.371. In general, the meaning of <em>thúella</em> ‘gust of wind’ is coextensive with the meaning of <em>hárpuia</em> ‘snatching wind, Harpy’: see the comments at O.20.061–080, where we find the combination of <em>thuéllai</em> ‘gusts of wind’ with <em>an-hélonto</em> ‘seized’ at O.20.066. Comparable is the combination of Ēṓs with <em>héleto</em> ‘seized’ at O.05.121—where Ēōs the goddess of the dawn abducts Orion. In the context of O.20.061–080, as highlighted in the comments on those lines, the combination of <em>thuéllai</em> ‘gusts of wind’ with <em>an-hélonto</em> ‘seized’ at O.20.066 is then restated at O.20.077 by way combining <em>hárpuiai</em> ‘snatching winds, Harpies’ with <em>an-ēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’.  By now I have accounted for all the Homeric attestations of <em>anēreípsanto</em> ‘snatched up’ as also for the solitary Hesiodic attestation of <em>anereipsaménē</em> ‘snatching up’.</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>As for <em>hárpuia</em> ‘snatching wind, Harpy’, the only other Homeric attestation besides those already surveyed in Part 2 is in the <em>Iliad</em>. At I.16.149–151, we see that a <em>hárpuia</em> ‘Harpy’ by the name of <em>Podárgē</em>, meaning ‘swift of foot’, was the mother of Xanthos and Balios, horses of Achilles, while the father of these horses was Zephyros the West Wind. In this connection, we may consider the Hesiodic description of the <em>hárpuiai</em> ‘snatching winds’ or ‘Harpies’, two in number, in <em>Theogony</em> 267–269: one is named <em>Aellṓ</em>, line 267, from <em>áella</em> ‘gust of wind’, and the other, <em>Ōkupétē</em>, the one who is ‘swiftly flying’, line 267. In short, the epic attestations of <em>hárpuia</em> betray a regular association with wind. Furthermore, this noun <em>hárpuia</em> may be formally connected with the verb transmitted as ἀνηρείψαντο ‘snatched up’ and ἀνερειψαμένη ‘snatching up’ in Homeric and Hesiodic diction respectively, as surveyed in Part 2: a decisive piece of evidence is a variant of <em>hárpuia</em>, shaped <em>arepuîa</em> (ἀρεπυῖα), attested in the <em>Etymologicum Magnum</em> (138.21) and on a vase inscription from Aegina (dual αρεπυια, see DELG under ῞Αρπυια).</p><p>Part 4.</p><p>On the basis of these surveys in Parts 1–3, we can see how beautiful young heroes like Kleitos, Tithōnos, Orion, Kephalos, Phaethon, and Ganymedes were abducted: in the poetic imagination, <em>they were snatched away by gusts of wind</em>. The imagery is most explicit in the story of Ganymedes. The <em>immediate agent</em> of the abduction is a gust of wind, and the father of Ganymedes does not know what happened to his son after the <em>áella</em> ‘gust of wind’ ‘snatched [him] up’, <em>an-ḗrpase</em>, as we read at line 208 of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em>. We should observe, however, that the <em>ultimate agent</em> is Zeus himself, who is the subject of the verb <em>hḗrpasen</em> ‘snatched’ designating the abduction of Ganymedes at line 203 of the <em>Hymn to Aphrodite</em>. As compensation for the abduction of Ganymedes, Zeus eventually gives to the boy’s father a team of wondrous horses, lines 210-211, who are described as <em>aellópodes</em> ‘having gusts of wind as their feet’, line 217 (ἀελλοπόδεσσιν). In this instance, both the action of <em>taking</em> and the action of <em>giving in return</em> center on the element of wind. But now, after having ascertained <em>how</em> such heroes were abducted, we may still ask <em>where</em> they were taken. In some cases, we can see that the outcome is positive, as when Ganymedes is taken to Olympus. In other cases, however, where a crossing of the cosmic river Ōkeanos is involved, the outcome may be either positive or negative.  A case in point is a complicated passage at O.20.061–080, which I will analyze when I reach my comment on those lines, though I highlight already here a relevant detail. When Penelope wishes for a gust of wind to snatch her up and drop her into the Ōkeanos, O.20.063–065, the <em>immediate agent</em> is a <em>thúella</em> ‘gust of wind’, O.20.063, though the <em>ultimate agents</em> are the gods themselves, O.20.079. This linking of the Ōkeanos at O.20.063–065 with the wished-for abduction of Penelope by gusts of wind is relevant to what we read at I.16.149–151: in is on the banks of this cosmic river Ōkeanos that the <em>hárpuia</em> ‘Harpy’ named <em>Podárgē</em> ‘swift of foot’ gave birth to the wind-horses of Achilles.

His dear son [= Telemachus] marveled at him, |179 and, in his amazement, he [= Telemachus] cast his gaze away from him, in another direction, fearing that he [= Odysseus] might be a god. |180 And he [= Telemachus] addressed him [= Odysseus], speaking winged words: |181 “As a different kind of person [<em>alloio</em>-], stranger, have you appeared [<em>phainesthai</em>] to me just now, different than before. |182 You have different clothes and your complexion is no longer the same kind [<em>homoio</em>-]. |183 You must be some god, one of those gods who hold the wide sky. |184 So be gracious, in order that we may give you pleasing sacrifices |185 and golden gifts of good workmanship. Have mercy on us.” |186 And he [= Telemachus] was answered then by the one who suffered many things, the radiant Odysseus: |187 “I am not some god. Why do you liken [<em>eïskein</em>] me to the immortals? |188 But I am your father, for whom you mourn and |189 suffer many pains, enduring the violent acts of men.” |190 Having said these things, he kissed his son and let fall from his cheeks |191 a tear, letting it fall to the ground. Until then he had persisted in showing no sign of pity. |192 And Telemachus, since he was not yet convinced that he [= Odysseus] was his father, |193 once again addressed him with words in reply: |194 “You are not Odysseus my father. Instead, some superhuman force |195 is enchanting me, and it makes me weep and mourn even more. |196 I say this because no mortal man could craft these things that are happening to me, |197 no mortal could do these things by way of his own devising, unless a god comes in person |198 and, if he so wishes, easily makes someone a young man or makes him an old man. |199 Why, just a little while ago you were an old man wearing unseemly clothes, |200 but now you look like [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] the gods who hold the wide sky.” |201 He was answered by Odysseus, the one with many kinds of craft, who addressed him thus: |202 “Telemachus, it does not seem right [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] for you to be amazed at your father who is right here inside [the shelter], |203 for you to be amazed too much or to feel overwhelmed. |204 There will never again be some different [<em>allos</em>] person who comes here, some different Odysseus, |205 but here I am such [<em>toiosde</em>] as I am. I have had many bad things happen to me. I have been detoured in many different ways. |206 But now I am here, having come back in the twentieth year to the land of my ancestors. |207 I tell you, this was the work of Athena, the giver of prizes, |208 who has made me be such [toios] as she wants me to be, for she has the power. |209 One moment, she has made me to be looking like [enalinkios] a beggar, and then, the next moment, |210 like a young man who has beautiful clothes covering his complexion. |211 It is easy for the gods, who hold the wide sky, |212 to make a mortal man become exalted with radiance or to debase him.</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from MoM 2§§18–20.) As soon as Odysseus has been stroked by the wand of Athena, his outward appearance—his <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’—is no longer the same as it had been before, O.16.182. That is what Telemachus is saying to Odysseus. The son is amazed that the father no longer looks like an old beggar. The word used here to express the idea of sameness is <em>homoio</em>- ‘similar to, same as’, O.16.182. This word <em>homoio</em>-, derived from <em>homó</em>-, further derives from the Indo-European form *<em>somo</em>- meaning ‘same’. In fact, the English word same is cognate with the Greek word <em>homó</em>--. See the anchor comment at I.05.441. Because the complexion of Odysseus is no longer the same, he no longer looks the same. Now he looks different. He is now a different kind of person. In the wording of O.16.181, Odysseus the person is now <em>alloio</em>- ‘a different kind’. This word <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is the opposite of <em>homoio</em>- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’. I note that the extension ‑<em>io</em>- (‑ιο-) of the adjectives homoio- (ὁμοῖο-) ‘the same kind’ and <em>alloio</em>- (ἀλλοῖο-) ‘a different kind’ is parallel to the extension ‑<em>io</em>- (‑ιο-) of the adjectives <em>hoio</em>- (oἷο-) ‘what kind’ and <em>toio</em>- (τοῖο-) ‘that kind’. At O.16.205 and O.16.208 in the passage I have just quoted and translated, we also see this meaning of <em>toio</em>- ‘that kind’ in action. In this same passage, it is said that Odysseus looks like an old man or looks like a young man, whatever a divinity may wish, O.16.198. But when he looks like a young man for Telemachus to see, his son needs to avert his eyes because he sees what he now sees, O.16.179. What he now sees is that <em>Odysseus at that moment looks not only like a young man but also like a divinity</em>. Relevant is the question that Odysseus asks his son at O.16.187: ‘Why do you liken [<em>eïskein</em>] me to the immortals?’... In answer to this question, Telemachus can rightly say at O.16.200: ‘but now you look like [= perfect of <em>eïskein</em>] the gods who hold the wide sky’. And, in terms of the ritual transformation of Odysseus by way of a sacred contact with the wand of the goddess Athena herself, this mortal not only looks like one of the gods but he actually becomes a god in the ritual moment marked by the similes that liken him to the god. So, the contexts of <em>eïskein</em> ‘make likenesses, liken’ at O.16.187 and O.16.200 show that Telemachus was justified in saying that Odysseus looks the same as a god after being touched by the wand of Athena. Similarly at O.03.464–468, there is a ritual transformation of Telemachus when he is bathed in a bathtub called an <em>asaminthos</em>, O.03.468. As I note in the comment on O.03.464–468, here is what happens at O.03.468 to Telemachus as a result of this ritual bath: ‘he [= Telemachus] emerged from the bathtub [<em>asaminthos</em>], looking the same as [<em>homoio</em>-] the immortals in shape’ (ἔκ ῥ’ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος). </p><p>In the light of this analysis, I offer a general formulation: for a mortal to appear like an immortal to other mortals is to become a divinity in a ritual moment of epiphany—as marked by the similes that make mortals equal to divinities in that ritual moment.</p>

# Odyssey 16.418-432

<p>As Penelope says in her words of blame directed at Antinoos here, this suitor of hers violates the rules of reciprocity more blatantly than any of the other suitors. That is because he shows no gratitude for the kindness that Odysseus as king had shown to Eupeithes, the father of Antinoos, back when Eupeithes was a refugee seeking the favor of Odysseus the king. In the story as told all too briefly by Penelope, O.16.424–429, this man Eupeithes had once sought refuge at the palace of Odysseus, asking the king to protect his food-supply, which was about to be expropriated, O.16.429. The threat of expropriation came from the <em>dēmos</em> ‘community’, described here as being very angry at Eupeithes, O.16.425. But Odysseus had intervened and prevented the expropriation, O.16.430. That is why it is now all the more outrageous, says Penelope at O.16.431, that the son of the same man whose livelihood had thus been saved by a beneficent king should now turn right around and expropriate the livelihood of his family’s benefactor, since Antinoos and the other suitors are now consuming the livelihood of Odysseus, depleting the resources of that generous king. That is bad enough, says Penelope, but Antinoos goes even further, much further: this ingrate also makes advances at the king’s wife and even plots the murder of the king’s son, O.16.431–432.  </p>

# Odyssey 17

<p>Back in Rhapsody 16, Eumaios the swineherd had left behind in his shelter an unrecognized Odysseus and had gone off to the palace in order to contact Penelope; in the swineherd’s absence, Telemachus, left alone with Odysseus, could now get to see his father transformed into an idealized godlike hero, made visible through a luminous epiphany produced by the sacred wand of the goddess Athena. This way, Telemachus could recognize the true Odysseus. But this true hero must not yet be recognized by the returning Eumaios. So, before the swineherd had ever made his return from the palace to the shelter, Athena had already produced a reverse transformation of Odysseus, and the hero could thus revert to his disguise as a lowly beggar. Now, at the beginning of Rhapsody 17, Odysseus can ready himself to go off to the palace in order to engage the suitors as a beggar, thus testing them. The testing will clearly reveal that all the suitors, down to the last man, are <em>morally debased on the inside while seeming to be noble on the outside</em>.

# Odyssey 17.292

<p>The form <em>Árgos</em>, as used here at O.17.292 and also at O.17.300, derives from the adjective <em>argós</em> ‘swift, alert; bright’. For example, hunting dogs or <em>kúnes</em> are conventionally described as <em>argoí</em> (κύνες ... ἀργοί). See the comment at O.17.062. The recessive accentuation of <em>Árgos</em> marks it as a proper noun—a name—as distinct from the adjective <em>argós</em> ‘swift, alert; bright’, which has a word-final accent. The name here applies to a beloved hunting dog of Odysseus. It has been twenty years since the hero last saw Argos, and he finds the hound in a pathetically degraded state: old and decrepit, Argos dies almost immediately after recognizing Odysseus, who appears on the surface to be similarly old and decrepit. The recognition is signaled by the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note of, notice’, O.17.301, which is used elsewhere as well in contexts of signaling recognition, as at O.08.094 and at O.08.533. See the comments there. See also the anchor comment at I.05.669 on <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’. Relevant is the note at I.13.726–735 about a generalizing statement that is made in those lines: it is said there that a person’s <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, I.13.732, is what enables him or her to ‘recognize’, <em>gignōskein</em>, I.13.734. At O.17.301, the recognition of the true Odysseus by a hound named <em>Árgos</em> can be seen as a Hermetic signature. In Homeric diction, the god Hermes is conventionally described as <em>argeïphóntēs</em>, as at O.01.038, and this agent noun can be read etymologically as ‘killing by way of speeding light’. The translation ‘speeding light’ corresponds to the etymology of the adjective <em>argós</em> ‘swift, alert; bright’, the more basic meaning of which is ‘shining with the speed of light’. (The etymology is analyzed at length in <em>DELG</em> under ἀργός.) Such a meaning is evident in forms that we find attested also in other Indo-European languages: for example, a cognate form of the <em>es</em>-stem <em>arges</em>- as in <em>argeï-phóntēs</em> is attested in the Indic epithet/name <em>r̥jí-śvan</em>- (as in <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.101.1), where  -<em>śvan</em>- is cognate with Greek <em>kúon</em>- ‘dog’: this epithet means something like ‘he whose hounds are swift’. But <em>argeï-phóntēs</em> must also have meant ‘killer of Argos’ in contexts where the name <em>Árgos</em> refers to a many-eyed and thus all-seeing hound that had been killed once upon a time by the god Hermes. The relevant myth, which centers on the transformation of a woman named Io into a cow guarded by Argos, is reflected for example in Aeschylus <em>Suppliants</em> 305: Ἄργον, τὸν Ἑρμῆς παῖδα γῆς κατέκτανεν ‘Argos the earthborn, whom Hermes killed’; at 304, in the same context, Argos is described as <em>panóptēs</em> ‘all-seeing’. In this myth, the name <em>Árgos</em> signals a monstrous double of Hermes himself, who is in his own right a panoptic marvel of perception and perceptiveness. We find a comparable situation in a medieval Irish myth about the hero Cú Chulainn, whose name is overtly understood to mean ‘Hound of Culann’. This hero had once upon a time killed a monstrous watchdog belonging to a smith named Culann. According to the myth as retold in Recension 1 of <em>The Cattle Raid of Cooley</em> the smith laments the death of the hound, saying that this wondrous beast had been the main protector of his herds of cattle and flocks of sheep; responding to the lament, Cú Chulainn promises that (1) he will raise another hound to replace the watchdog he had killed and that, in the meantime, (2) he, Cú Chulainn, will serve as the main protector of the smith’s herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. Hearing the twofold promise of Cú Chulainn, a man named Cathbad, who is the druid of Conchobar, king of the Ulstermen, now makes a pronouncement: from here on, says the druid, the hero who killed the hound of the smith Culann will forever be called Cú Chulainn, which means ‘Hound of Culann’. Cú Chulainn responds to the druid’s pronouncement by formally accepting his new name. In this Irish myth, the detail about the association of Cú Chulainn with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep is comparable with what we know about the association of the god Hermes with cattle and sheep, as for example in the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (4) <em>to Hermes</em>: sheep at line 2, cattle at line 14. In this same Irish myth, we see another detail that is comparable to what we know about Hermes: Cú Chulainn, before he kills the Hound of Culann, is named Sétantae. Etymologically, the meaning of this name seems to be ‘knower of the roads’ (<em>sét</em> mean ‘road’: see Ó hUiginn 2006:508). [[I owe this reference to Joseph Nagy.]] By way of comparison, I highlight a detail in the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (4) <em>to Hermes</em>, line 303, where Hermes is told to lead the way to the secret place where he had hidden the cattle of Apollo: ‘you lead the way’ (σὺ δ&#x27; αὖθ&#x27; ὁδὸν ἡγεμονεύσεις); the idea of ‘leading the way’ is repeated at line 392 (Ἑρμῆν δὲ ... ἡγεμονεύειν). In the case of Hermes, the myth about his killing Argos, who can be seen as a monstrous canine version of his other self, signals the god’s absolutized powers of perception and recognition. Such powers are characteristic of the hero Odysseus as well, who as we have seen already at O.01.001 is linked with the god Hermes by way of his own heroic capacity for shape-shifting, which can be viewed as the ultimate challenge to a recognition of the true self. See the comment on O.01.001–010, Point 2. Another relevant Hermetic signature, I propose, is the name Eúmaios, the first occurrence of which can be found at O.14.055. The context there is this: Eumaios the swineherd has just called off a pack of fierce watchdogs that had been threatening to harm the disguised Odysseus, O.14.029–038. What seems to be Hermetic about the name of this swineherd is the element -<em>maios</em>, which I connect with the name of the god’s mother, <em>Maîa</em>, as in the <em>Homeric Hymn</em> (4) <em>to Hermes</em> line 4. This name is derived from the noun <em>maîa</em>, meaning ‘midwife’ (<em>DELG</em> under μαῖα). Accordingly, I interpret <em>Eúmaios</em> as meaning something like ‘linked with good midwifery’. </p>

<p>What the speakers are speaking about here at O.17.336–355 is the ethical imperative of feeding the hungry who cannot afford to feed themselves. Someone who responds to such an ethical imperative will be performing an act of generosity that shows ethical nobility. Such nobility, which comes from within, distinguishes Telemachus from the suitors of Penelope, who are noble only in their exterior appearance. The begging that is about to be performed by the disguised Odysseus here will be a testing of the suitors—whose lack of generosity will fully expose them in all their ethical deficiency.  </p>

# Odyssey 17.381-17.391

<p>Addressing Antinoos, Eumaios scolds him for his lack of generosity. Antinoos, he says, fails to observe the common rules of decency, which require that you treat any ‘stranger’ as a ‘guest’, <em>xenos</em>, O.17.382. Thus you must perform the role of a good host. See the comment at O.08.026–045 on the meaning of <em>xenos</em> as both ‘stranger’ and ‘guest’. If you treat a stranger as a guest, then you will be reciprocated—unless of course the stranger turns out to be an enemy, in which case the reciprocity can be canceled. Still, you must first presume that the stranger will reciprocate you. True, strangers who are beggars can reciprocate you the least or not at all, but, all the same, your inner nobility must still oblige you to treat even beggars as guests. The irony here, of course, is that Antinoos is in no position to act as a host, since he is expropriating the property and livelihood of the absent Odysseus, who should be the real host, while Antinoos is the worst of guests, since he denies food to strangers when the food does not even belong to him. </p>

# Odyssey 17.381-391

<p>Aside from beggars, there are of course many other kinds of <em>xenoi</em> ‘strangers’ to be hosted as potential guests. In the wording of Eumaios, such potential <em>xenoi</em> include various kinds of craftsmen or <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>), O.17.383. This word means literally ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’, where <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ is to be understood as a legally-sanctioned zone of activity within which craftsmen are authorized to be practicing their crafts. Comparable is the concept of <em>áes cerd</em> ‘people of the crafts’ in medieval Irish legal traditions: these craftsmen are entitled to juridical immunity as they travel from one petty kingdom or túath to another in the course of practicing their crafts, <em>and the practitioners of such crafts include various social grades of poets</em>. (Details in Nagy 2011a §149.) Similarly in the case of the <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>) ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’ at O.17.383: these craftsmen too must have been juridically immune as they traveled from one <em>dēmos</em> to another in the course of practicing their crafts. The practictioners of such crafts included the categories of <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’, <em>iētēr</em> ‘physician’, and <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’, as we see at O.17.384. And, as in the case of the medieval Irish craftsmen, these crafts also included the category of the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ or poet, as we see at O.17.385.  </p>

# Odyssey 17.384-17.385

<p>The parallelism of the <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter’ with the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ is particularly noteworthy, since the craft of the singer is conventionally compared to the craft of the carpenter. Especially relevant here is the wording in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 3.113–114: here the poets of epic are compared metaphorically to <em>tektones</em> ‘carpenters, joiners’ who ‘join together’ the <em>epea</em> ‘words’ of poetry (ἐπέων ... τέκτονες οἷα ... | ἅρμοσαν). The verb-stem <em>harmot</em>-/<em>harmod</em>- that I translate as ‘join together’ here (ἅρμοσαν) derives from the root *<em>ar</em>-, meaning ‘join’. Relevant is the &quot;speaking name&quot; (<em>nomen loquens</em>) name of Homer, <em>Hóm-ēros</em>, which can be analyzed morphologically as a compounding of <em>homo</em>- ‘together’ with the root <em>ar</em>- ‘join’, meaning ‘he who joins together’ in the metaphorical sense of a ‘joiner, carpenter’.

<p>Speaking to Penelope, Eumaios describes the stranger whom he has been hosting in his shelter: for Eumaios, the disguised Odysseus is comparable to an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’, O.17.518. Thus the reciprocity that this would-be beggar is offering in the role of a would-be guest needs to be reassessed from minimum to maximum. The reciprocation that Eumaios as a good host will ultimately receive from Odysseus—and from the poets for whom Odysseus as poet will be a model—is destined to be most positive. Most negative, on the other hand, is the reciprocation that is destined for Antinoos and for the other suitors.  </p>

# Odyssey 18.1-117

<p>This story, extending from line 1 of Rhapsody 18 all the way through line 117, shows a temporary change in poetic form. There is a sudden switch here from epic to non-epic. The character of Iros, as named at O.18.06, is non-epic, even anti-epic or, better, mock epic. We see here the story of a mock epic character who looks like an epic hero on the outside but who does not measure up, on the inside, to epic standards. In outward appearance, he qualifies as <em>megas</em> ‘great, big’, O.18.04, but he is ridiculously weak on the inside: that is, he lacks the epic inner quality of <em>īs</em> ‘force, violence, strength’, O.18.03. This quality, so blatantly lacking in the character of Iros, is also indicated by way of the word <em>biē</em> at O.18.04, which means the same thing as does <em>īs</em> at O.18.03: ‘force, violence, strength’. The action that will take place after Iros insults and even threatens Odysseus will prove that Iros is weak on the inside, and this weakness will disqualify him from surviving in epic.  </p>

<p>|1 ἦλθε δ᾽ ἐπὶ πτωχὸς πανδήμιος, ὃς κατὰ ἄστυ |2 πτωχεύεσκ᾽ Ἰθάκης, μετὰ δ᾽ ἔπρεπε γαστέρι μάργῃ |3 ἀζηχὲς φαγέμεν καὶ πιέμεν· οὐδέ οἱ ἦν ἲς |4 οὐδὲ βίη, εἶδος δὲ μάλα μέγας ἦν ὁράασθαι </p><p>|1 Then came a beggar [<em>ptōkhos</em>], ranging-all-over-the-district [<em>dēmos</em>], who all through the town [<em>astu</em>] |2 of Ithaca would go around begging. He stood out, with his gluttonous [<em>margē</em>] stomach, |3 because of his endless eating and drinking. And he had no <em>īs</em>, |4 nor <em>biē</em>, but in appearance he was big to look at.</p><p>Here I leave untranslated the synonyms <em>īs</em> and <em>biē</em>, both of which I had previously translated as ‘force, strength, violence’ in the note at O.18.001–117. As I already observed in that note, appearances here are deceiving: Iros looks strong on the outside but he is weak on the inside, and the exposure of his weakness will prove to be something that is ridiculed in epic. The act of ridiculing is the program, as it were, of mock epic, but here the mocking is reversed: now it is epic that will be mocking mock epic. As we are about to see, epic will overcome mock epic. Odysseus, even though he looks weak on the outside, will beat up on Iros, who looks strong on the outside. The mock epic form to which the epic refers here is signaled by a most telling word: it is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’, at O.18.002, describing the <em>gastēr</em> ‘stomach’ of Iros, who stands out as an ostentatiously greedy consumer of food and drink, O.18.002–003. A character who is <em>margos</em> is not just a negative example of lowly humans in general: in the poetic language of praise/blame, such a character is a negative example of lowly poets in particular. A lowly man who is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’ is to be seen generically as a greedy blame poet. Such a blame poet, as we will now see, is typical of a poetic form that I describe here as mock epic. We can see the formal features of such a poetic form at the very beginning of Rhapsody 18, where the wording matches in syntax the beginning of a mock epic known as the <em>Margites</em>. There the main character to be introduced on stage, as it were, is described not as a <em>ptōkhos</em> ‘beggar’, as here at O.18.001, but as a poet who turns out to be a blame poet. I show here the actual wording that we find at the beginning of that mock epic (<em>Margites</em> F 1 ed. West):</p><p>|1 ἦλθέ τις ἐς Κολοφῶνα γέρων καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδός, |2 Μουσάων θεράπων καὶ ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος, |3 φίλῃς ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν εὔφθογγον λύρην</p><p>|1 Then came to Colophon some man, an old man, a divine [<em>theios</em>] singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |2 surrogate [<em>therapōn</em>] of the Muses and of Apollo who shoots from afar, |3 and in his hands, those hands of his, he held a lyre that made a beautiful sound.</p><p>As we see from the explicit description here, Margites is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’: that is, he is a poet. Moreover, he is a blame poet, as we see even from the morphology of his name <em>Margī́tēs</em>, derived from the adjective <em>margós</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’. This “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Margī́tēs</em> is morphologically parallel to another &quot;speaking name,&quot; <em>Thersī́tēs</em>, which means &#x27;the bold one&#x27; (tharsos/thersos is &#x27;boldness&#x27; in negative contexts of blame poetry). This character named Thersites is represented in the <em>Iliad</em> as a blame poet of the worst kind: see the comments at I.02.214, I.02.216, I.02.217–219, I.02.221, I.02.222, I.02.224, I.02.225–242, I.02.235, I.02.241–242, I.02.243, I.02.245, I.02.246–264, I.02.246, I.02.247, I.02.248–249, I.02.251, I.02.255, I.02.256, I.02.265–268, I.02.269–270, I.02.275, I.02.277. In the narrative about Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, as I pointed out in my comments on the verses I just listed, it is clear that blame poetry is antithetical not only to praise poetry but also to epic, and that epic has the power to blame, in its own right, this blame poetry. Thus, epic can defeat blame poetry, making it an object of ridicule just as blame poets attempt to make epic an object of ridicule. When Odysseus beats up on Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry. Similarly, when Odysseus beats up on Iros in the <em>Odyssey</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry and, further, epic is also defeating mock epic. In the case of the <em>Margites</em>, this mock epic starts off mock seriously by describing the poet simply as a poet, though the he will turn out to be a blame poet as the narrative proceeds. The metrical form of such mock epic is a combination of two kinds of verses: (1) dactylic hexameters, which are the medium of epic, and (2) iambic trimeters, which had once been the medium of mock poetry in general—the word for which is <em>iambos</em> (BA 243–252). A case in point is what we find in the attested fragments of the <em>Margites</em>: in the three verses of this poem’s beginning, already quoted above, the first two verses are dactylic hexameters, to be contrasted with the third verse, which is an iambic trimeter (Nagy 2015.10.15 §§28–29). At a later point in this same fragmentary poem, we see other such iambic trimeters, the most notable example of which is this verse (<em>Margites</em> F 201.1 ed. West F 4b.1):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>The same verse is attested in a fable, “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” which is embedded in blame poetry attributed to Archilochus (F 201.1 ed. West):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>Such uses of fables in both poetry and prose are suitable for praising or for blaming or simply for warning (BA 280–288; Nagy 2011a §§6–7, 129, 138–146). In the case of “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” Fable 427 (ed. Perry), there is such an element of warning attested in a version attributed to Aesop by Aristotle <em>Rhetoric</em> 2.1393b22–1394a1, who reports that this fable was narrated by Aesop to the people of Samos on the occasion of their impending execution of a ‘demagogue’. [[GN 2017.07.20.]]</p><p>Addendum:</p><p>In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b24–34, Aristotle reconstructs an early phase of praise poetry and blame poetry where praise evolves into epic, as exemplified by the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, while blame evolves into the poetry of playful ridicule, as exemplified by the mock epic <em>Margites</em>, which Aristotle actually attributes to Homer. In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b34–1449a6, Aristotle goes on to argue that the poetry of epic evolved further into tragedy while the poetry of playful ridicule evolved further into comedy (additional comments in Nagy 2015.10.15 §§15–16). In terms of Aristotle’s terminology, then the mock epic <em>Margites</em> can be described as a hybrid form of comedy. [[GN 2017.07.20.]] </p>

# Odyssey 18.006-18.007

<p>The &quot;speaking name&quot; (nomen loquens) of Îr<em>o</em>s (῏Ιρος), Ο.18.006, is linked here with the name of <em>Îris</em> (῏Ιρις), the goddess who functions as divine messenger. On the name of Iris, see the comment on I.17.547–549. Iros too carries messages, as we see here from the use of <em>apangellein</em> ‘carry messages’ at O.18.008; unlike Iris, however, Iros carries messages indiscriminately: ‘whenever anyone tells him [to carry a message]’, O.18.008. Such an indiscriminate function as performed by Iros is ridiculous compared to the deliberate and serious function performed by Iris, who carries only those messages that are sent by the immortal gods themselves. Just as Iros himself has no inner ‘force’—no <em>īs</em> and no <em>biē</em>, as we saw at O.18.003 and O.18.004 respectively, so also the messages that he carries from one random person to another random person have no inner ‘force’ either. To be contrasted is the goddess Isis, who as carrier of divine messages is the embodiment of the inner ‘force’ that is contained in these messages: her name actually derives from the root *<em>u̯ī</em>- as in <em>īs</em> ‘force, violence, strength’. Also, as I point out in the comment at I.17.547–549, the conventional association of this goddess Iris with windspeed is parallel with the association of windspeed with the words <em>īs</em> and <em>biē</em>, which both mean ‘force, violence, strength’.  </p>

You seem to be a wandering-beggar [<em>alētēs</em>] |19 like me,  and it is the gods who are likely to grant prosperity [<em>olbos</em>].</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from BA 228.) The verb <em>phthoneîn</em> ‘begrudge’ corresponds to the noun <em>phthonos</em> ‘being begrudging’. To begrudge is to feel ungenerous about giving something to someone else to have, or even about accepting a pre-existing situation where someone else already has something that you don’t want for that someone to have—because you want to have it instead. In the praise poetry of Pindar, as at <em>Olympian</em> 8.55, <em>phthonos</em> conventionally applies to blame poetry. In such praise poetry, blame poets are viewed as ungenerously negative about the very thought that someone should be getting praised by praise poetry. It is this kind of <em>phthonos</em> ‘begrudging’ that we find encapsulated in the behavior of Iros toward Odysseus. Picking a quarrel, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> at O.18.009, Iros hurls words of blame against Odysseus. In doing so, he also orders Odysseus to get out of the way, O.18.010, threatening that the present <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ between the two of them, O.18.013, may escalate from verbal to physical violence, Ο.18.010–013. The disguised master of the household refuses to budge from the doorway, answering Iros with the words that I have just quoted from O.18.015–019. There the collocation of <em>olbos</em> ‘prosperity’ at O.18.019 with <em>phthoneîn</em> ‘begrudge’ at O.18.016 and O.18.018 reflects a traditional way of thinking, well attested also in Pindar’s praise poetry, which teaches that prosperity is given by the gods to the righteous—and that this gift is threatened by the unrighteous, who feel begrudging about such god-given prosperity. Ironically, the prosperity of Odysseus himself is now being threatened by the suitors, whose messenger Iros, as a mock Iris, is so begrudging as to hinder our hero from even entering his own household. Without having to identify himself as the real householder, however, Odysseus warns Iros not ‘to be begrudging [<em>phthoneîn</em>] about the property of others’ (ἀλλοτρίων φθονέειν), O.18.018. Such a begrudging attitude on the part of Iros is directly comparable to blame poetry in its function as a traditional negative foil of praise poetry within praise poetry, where the vice of gluttony is pictured as a prime characteristic of blame poetry: hence the saying ‘words are a morsel for those who are begrudging [<em>phthoneroi</em>]’ (ὄψον δὲ λόγοι φθονεροῖσιν) in Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 8.21. In fact, we now see from the Homeric description of Iros that his role as a blame poet is manifested in precisely this sort of gluttony. And the key word is <em>margos</em> &#x27;gluttonous, wanton&#x27;.   </p>

# Odyssey 18.73-74

<p>Even before the physical combat between the disguised Odysseus and Iros takes place, Iros is already losing his nerve as he sees Odysseus half-revealed in the hero’s true form through the intervention of the goddess Athena, O.18.069–071. The reaction of the suitors is to start maliciously gloating over the fear shown by Iros, and the Master Narrator quotes here at O.18.073–074 what any one of the suitors might be saying as they gloat. And what the suitors say is already mocking Iros for failing to live up to his outward appearance of manly strength: the suitors are saying derisively that Iros is really unmanly, not manly. Just as the Master Narrator had previously said—and I highlighted this already in the comment at O.18.001–004—Iros may seem to be <em>megas</em> ‘great, big’ on the outside, O.18.004, but he is ridiculously weak on the inside: that is, he lacks the epic inner quality of īs ‘force, violence, strength’, O.18.003. This quality, so blatantly lacking in the character of Iros, is also indicated by way of the word <em>biē</em> at O.18.04, which means the same thing as does <em>īs</em> at O.18.03: ‘force, violence, strength’. The fear shown by Iros, leading to his defeat at the hands of Odysseus, proves that he really has no <em>īs</em>, no <em>bíē</em>. Accordingly, the suitors now call him <em>Á-īros</em>, O.18.073, which may be reconstructed as *<em>n̥-u̯īros</em> and glossed etymologically as ‘he who has no force = *<em>u̯īs</em>’. This form serves as a comic correction for what now emerges as the sarcastically misapplied meaning of the &quot;speaking name&quot; (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Îros</em> as *<em>u̯īros</em> ‘he who has force = *<em>u̯īs</em>’. Now we see that the form <em>Îros</em> seems is a play on an unattested Greek word *<em>u̯īros</em>, cognate with Latin <em>vīr</em> ‘man’, etc. The mocking name <em>Á-īros</em> O.18.073 explains the sarcasm built into the mocking name <em>Îros</em>. This mocking name <em>Îros</em> in the sense of *<em>u̯īros</em> ‘he who has *<em>u̯īs</em>’ is not incompatible with the likewise mocking association of Iros with Iris, the messenger of the gods, as analyzed in the comment at O.18.006–007: as I argued in that comment, the name <em>Îris</em> itself can be derived from the same root *<em>u̯ī</em>- as in <em>ī́s</em> ‘force, violence, strength’. </p>

For truly your glory [<em>kleos</em>] reaches the wide firmament of the sky itself |109 —like the glory of some faultless king [<em>basileus</em>], who, godlike as he is, |110 and ruling over a population that is multitudinous and vigorous, |111 upholds good acts of <em>dikē</em> [= <em>eu-dikiai</em>], while the dark earth produces |112 wheat and barley, the trees are loaded with fruit, |113 the ewes steadily bring forth lambs, and the sea abounds with fish, |114 by reason of the good directions he gives, and his people are-meritorious [<em>aretân</em>] under his rule.</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 12§§4–12§§4–7.) The wording here at O.19.107–114 shows the only place in the <em>Odyssey</em> where Penelope is said to have <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ herself, O.19.108, but even here the glory emanates more broadly from the poetic tradition that features primarily Odysseus and only secondarily those who are close to him, especially Penelope. This passage here will be relevant to the context of the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ attributed to Odysseus at O.24.196, to be analyzed in the comment on that line (further analysis in H24H 9§§22–23; also BA 38). Here at O.19.107–114, the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of Penelope depends on the validity of comparing this glory with the corresponding glory of the unnamed king whose ‘good acts of <em>dikē</em>’ energize the fertility and prosperity of the land he rules. Since the words about this just king are spoken by the disguised Odysseus, it is evident that he himself will take the role of that just king when the time comes. But when exactly will that time come? Will it be after he kills the suitors? Or will it be after he dies? I ask the second question because the wording that refers to the inhabitants of the fertile and prosperous land of the just king is remarkably parallel to the wording that referred to the inhabitants of the kingdom of Odysseus after he is dead: they are said to be <em>olbioi</em> ‘blessed’, O.11.137. See the comment at O.11.136–137. This wording comes from the prophecy of Teiresias to Odysseus at O.11.090-137, which I quoted in my comments on Rhapsody 11. As also in those comments, I draw attention once again to the word <em>olbioi</em> here, which I continue to translate here as ‘blessed’, and which describes the inhabitants of the kingdom of Odysseus. As I argued in the comment at O.11.136–137, this word <em>olbioi</em>, ‘blessed’, refers to the blessings of fertility and prosperity that the inhabitants of Ithaca receive as a result of the hero’s death (the prophecy of his death at O.11.136–137 will be retold at O.23.283–284). This death will lead to the transformation of Odysseus into a cult hero (further analysis in H24H 11§59). In the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>, verse 172, this same word <em>olbioi</em>, ‘blessed’, is used to describe cult heroes who are immortalized after death and who enjoy a state of bliss in the Islands of the Blessed, which is a paradisiacal setting that transcends the temporal and the spatial constraints associated with sites where the bodies of cult heroes are believed to be buried (further analysis in H24H 11§15). My argument, then, is that the picture of a just king who rules over a fertile and prosperous land here at O.19.107–114 refers to the future status of Odysseus as a cult hero. But I still need to confront a possible objection: why would a cult hero be described as a <em>basileus</em>, ‘king’, at O.19.109? And besides, would not the title of ‘king’ fit Odysseus when he is alive, right after he kills the suitors and recovers his kingdom—and before he is dead? True, the title would fit then as well, but I maintain that the context of the words spoken by the disguised Odysseus to Penelope is more transcendent. The fact is, the title of ‘king’ fits the cult hero as well. There is evidence to show that the generic cult hero is conventionally described as a <em>basileus</em>, ‘king’ (further analysis in BA 170–172). In a stylized <em>thrēnos</em> or ‘lament’ composed by Pindar (F 133, quoted by Plato <em>Meno</em> 81b), for example, <em>hēroes hagnoi</em>, ‘holy heroes’, are equated with <em>basilēes</em>, ‘kings’ (βασιλῆες ἀγαυοὶ … ἥροες ἁγνοί. Also, in an inscription grounded in rituals honoring the dead, in a context of promising a blissful life after death, the dead person is told: καὶ τότ’ ἔπειτ’ ἄ[λλοισι μεθ’] ἡρώεσσιν ἀνάξει[ς] ‘and then you will be king [<em>anassein</em>] among the other heroes [<em>hērōes</em>]’ (<em>IG</em> XIV 638 = SEG 40:824[2]; further analysis in BA 171, where the citation needs to be corrected).  </p>

<p>In the comment at O.17.381–394, I noted the listing there of four kinds of craftsment who belong to the category of <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>) ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’, where <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ is to be understood as a legally-sanctioned zone of activity within which craftsmen are authorized to be practicing their crafts. The four kinds of craftsmen were the <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’, the <em>iētēr</em> ‘physician’, and the <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’ at O.17.384 and the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ or poet at O.17.385. Now we see here at O.19.135 a fifth kind of craftsman, the <em>kērux</em> ‘herald.’  </p>

<p>οὐ γὰρ ἀπὸ δρυὸς ἐσσὶ παλαιφάτου οὐδ’ ἀπὸ πέτρης</p><p>‘For surely you are not from an oak, going back to an old saying, or from a rock.’</p><p>In asking the disguised Odysseus to reveal his origins, Penelope says she assumes that the genealogy of this unidentified man is not all that difficult to trace: surely this man does not need to trace his ancestry all the way back to the prototypes of humanity, which would be an exercise in a special kind of mythology that can best be described as anthropogony. In the anthropogonic myths that have survived in the Greek language—as also in other Indo-European languages—two most common alternative versions claim that the First Human originated from a tree or from a rock. The tree is commonly pictured as an oak. The epithet <em>palaiphato</em>- ‘going back to an old saying’ here at O.19.163 applies not only to the proverbial <em>drūs</em> ‘oak’ but also to the comparably proverbial <em>petrē</em> ‘rock’. Both versions of such an anthropogonic myth center on a violent act that is simultaneously destructive and regenerative: the ignition, as it were, of the First Human happens when a thunderbolt strikes a primordial tree or rock.

The relationship of Aithōn to Minos and to Idomeneus reflects a synthesizing of Minoan and Mycenaean “signatures.” A clearly Minoan signature is the detail about Minos as the grandfather, and a clearly Mycenaean signature is the detail about Idomeneus as the older brother: this Idomeneus is of course one of the most prominent Achaean warriors in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> as we know it.

<p>Here at O.19.178, I translate the pronoun <em>têisi</em> (τῇσι) as ‘in this land [plural]’. This pronoun, referring to the land of Crete, is in the plural, not in the the singular, as we might have expected. The explanation can be found in the comment at O.14.199, where we see <em>Krētē</em>, the name of Crete, not in the singular but in the plural, <em>Krêtai</em>. As I point out in that comment, plural <em>Krêtai</em> cannot mean a multiplicity of islands named Crete. There is no such thing. Rather, we see there an elliptic plural, meaning ‘Crete and everything that belongs to it’. And of course whatever belongs to Crete are all the Aegean islands and lands controlled by the thalassocracy of Crete. So also in the case of the pronoun τῇσι as ‘in this land [plural]’ at O.19.178, we see an elliptic plural referring to Crete together with everything that belongs to Crete. So, even the pronoun signals the imperial power of Crete.  </p>

# Odyssey 19.183

<p>This name Aithōn derives from the participle <em>aíthōn</em> of the verb <em>aíthein</em> ‘burn’. In the lore of fable, <em>aithōn</em> suits such characters as the crafty fox who is ‘burning’ with hunger and will rely on his craftiness to find ways to feed his insatiable stomach. Such lore is reported in the scholia for Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 11.9, where the generic <em>alōpēx</em> ‘fox’ is actually described as <em>aithōn</em>. Such a description can apply in negative contexts to a beggar in pursuit of food for his insatiable stomach, who in turn is comparable to a greedy blame poet in pursuit of rewards for his poetry. See the comment on O.18.001–004. In positive contexts, on the other hand, the name Aithōn can apply to a righteous man who is ‘burning’ with hunger for justice, as in Theognis 1209–1210 (commentary and further details in GMP 273–274). For more on Aithōn, I strongly recommend the analysis of Levaniouk 2011:36–49.  </p>

# Odyssey 19.188

<p>Detoured by violent winds, the Odysseus of this Cretan Odyssey lands in Crete. The place where he lands is Amnisos, and a poetic landmark for this place is a cave of Eileithuia. As we know from the reportage of Strabo, who flourished in the first century BCE, Amnisos was reputed to be the sea harbor of Minos the king. Here is the precise wording of Strabo (10.4.8 C476): Μίνω δέ φασιν ἐπινείῳ χρήσασθαι τῷ Ἀμνισῷ, ὅπου τὸ τῆς Εἰλειθυίας ἱερόν ‘they say that Minos used Amnisos as his seaport, and the sacred-space [<em>hieron</em>] of Eileithuia is there’. According to Pausanias (4.20.2), the priestess of Eileithuia at Olympia makes a regular offering to this goddess as also to her cult-hero protégé Sosipolis, and this offering is described as <em>mazas</em> ... <em>memagmenas meliti</em> ‘barley-cakes [<em>mazai</em>] kneaded in honey [<em>meli</em>]’ (μάζας ... μεμαγμένας μέλιτι). In Laconia and Messenia, the goddess <em>Eileithuia</em> was known as <em>Eleuthia</em>, and this form of her name is actually attested in a Linear B tablet found at Knossos. Here is my transcription of the relevant wording that is written in Knossos tablet Gg 705 line 1:</p><p>a-mi-ni-so / e-re-u-ti-ja ME+RI AMPHORA 1</p><p><em>Amnisos: Eleuthiāi meli </em>[followed by the ideogram for “amphora”] 1</p><p>‘Amnisos: for Eleuthia, honey, one amphora’.</p><p>We see here at O.19.188 a striking example of details in Homeric poetry that show continuity with the era of Minoan-Mycenaean civilization. My original argumentation concerning the Minoan-Mycenaean heritage of the details we read in this Homeric verse at O.19.188 appeared in Nagy 1969. For further details on what is said by Pausanias 4.20.2 about Eileithuia, see Nagy 2015.02.25. For more on O.19.188 in the overall context of O.19.185–193, I strongly recommend Levaniouk 2011:93–96.  </p>

Most comparable are the verses that are said to be spoken by the Muses to Hesiod in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em>, 26–28:</p><p>|26 ποιμένες ἄγραυλοι, κάκ᾿ ἐλέγχεα, γαστέρες οἶον, |27 ἴδμεν ψεύδεα πολλὰ λέγειν ἐτύμοισιν ὁμοῖα, |28 ἴδμεν δ᾿, εὖτ᾿ ἐθέλωμεν, ἀληθέα γηρύσασθαι. </p><p>|26 Shepherds camping in the fields, base objects of reproach, mere stomachs [<em>gasteres</em>]! |27 We know how to say many deceptive [<em>pseudea</em>] things looking like [<em>homoia</em>] genuine [<em>etuma</em>] things, |28 but we also know how, whenever we wish it, to proclaim things that are true [<em>alēthea</em>].</p><p>(What follows is epitomized from MoM 2§§22–28.) In these Hesiodic verses, what is deceptive is not the fact that some things ‘look like’ other things. Rather, what is deceptive is that <em>pseudea</em> ‘deceptive things’ can look like <em>etuma</em> ‘real things’. On this point, see also the comment at O.14.124–125. And even deceptive things that look like real things can still be equal to real things, the same as real things. As I indicated in my comments at O.16.172–212, for example, Odysseus is really ‘equal to the immortals’ when he looks like an immortal in ritual contexts. As I also indicated in those comments, the contexts of <em>eïskein</em> ‘make likenesses, liken’ at O.16.187 and O.16.200 show that Telemachus was justified in saying that Odysseus looks the same as a god after being touched by the wand of Athena. If Telemachus was at first deceived by the looks of Odysseus in such contexts, then the deception was happening from the viewpoint of an uninitiated beholder who could not yet distinguish between what is deceptive and what is real. Similarly in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em>, the figure of Hesiod has been such an uninitiated beholder before his poetic initiation into the art of the Muses. After his initiation, however, he can now envision what is real even when he beholds things that can be deceptive. The same principle holds whenever Odysseus utters words to be envisioned only by those who have already been initiated into the art of the Muses of poetry. That is what happens here at O.19.203. What is deceptive about the deceptive things that Odysseus is saying in his Third Cretan Tale is not the fact that some things ‘look like’ other things. Rather, what is deceptive is that <em>pseudea</em> ‘deceptive things’ look like <em>etuma</em> ‘real things’. And, once again, even these deceptive things that look like real things can still be equal to real things—the same as the real things that are seen by those who are initiated into the art of the Muses. This art is the art of poetic imagination, which can make even deceptive things look like real things, be equal to real things, be the same as real things. Such is the art that is borrowed by the alluring figure of Helen when she makes her voice identical to the voice of any wife of any Homeric hero: see the comment on <em>eïksein</em> ‘liken’ at O.04.279. Helen’s voice, borrowed from the poetry of the Muses, has the power of conjuring the voices of the wives themselves. And, by extension, her poetic voice has the power of conjuring the very images of the wives. True, Helen means to deceive, but her deceptive words in this narrative frame are the same as the real words of Homeric poetry in the overall narrative frame of that poetry—real words that activate visions of the real things of Homeric poetry. These real things are whatever is real for this poetry, which is figured as true overall, even if it contains things that seem at first to be deceptive. For Homeric poetry, whatever is divinely true can contain deceptions and still be true.  </p>

# Odyssey 19.204-19.212

<p>The emotional response of Penelope to the Third Cretan Tale as told by the disguised Odysseus is to break down in tears. The idea of her <em>melting away in tears</em>, as expressed by way of the verb <em>tēkesthai</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’ at O.19.204 and O.19.208, is directly compared here by way of simile—ὡς ‘just as’ at O.19.205—to the melting of snow on top of a mountain when it makes contact with the West Wind: here the basic physical process of a <em>melting</em> of snow is expressed by way of the verb <em>kata-tēkesthai</em>/<em>kata-tēkein</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’ at O.19.205/O.19.206. If such familiar idioms as <em>melting away in tears</em> did not exist in the English language today, as also in other modern languages, then the very idea that the <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’ of Penelope at O.19.204 and her <em>parēïa</em> ‘cheeks’ at O.19.208 were ‘melting away’, as expressed by <em>tēkesthai</em>’, would surely seem far more defamiliarizing. But the fact is, a feeling that is quite alien is happening in the Homeric comparison here: a macrocosmic process of melting snow is being drawn into a microcosmic personal experience of pouring out your tears from your eyes, all over your complexion—with the result that all of you liquifies. Here the world of similes and metaphors extends into the world of metonymy: the emotional intensity of personal experience connects to the dynamics of the cosmos, as when snow melts.   </p>

The scar that Eurykleia recognizes here turns out to be a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ of the hero’s true identity, as we see from the use of that word at O.21.217 and at O.23.073. See the comments at O.21.217–224 and at O.23.073–077 respectively. This word <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ does not occur here at O.19.388–507, but the occurrences at O.21.217 and at O.23.073 indicate clearly that the scar as a <em>sēma</em> is a subtext, as it were, for the recognition scene that frames the narrative about the boar hunt at Parnassus.</p>

<p>Penelope tests the disguised Odysseus by challenging him to interpret a dream that she had, which is for her a sign that she says she needs to be interpreted for her, O.19.535–553. Odysseus responds to the sign, giving his interpretation, O.19.555–558, and then Penelope responds to the interpretation, O.19.560–569. What Penelope dreams, O.19.535–553, is that the geese in her courtyard are suddenly killed by an eagle that swoops down on them. She cries and cries over the loss of her geese. But then, within the narrative of the dream itself, O.19.546–550, the eagle is quoted as saying to Penelope that he is Odysseus and that the geese are the suitors, who are to be punished for their unjust behavior. The disguised Odysseus responds to the convoluted words of Penelope by saying that her dream has already interpreted itself and that no response is needed from him—except to say what he has just said, that the dream has already interpreted itself, O.17.555–558. This way, Odysseus postpones identifying himself to Penelope, but at the same time he shows his good judgment in distinguishing between what is false and what is true about his own heroic identity as defined by his sense of justice, which is being challenged by the injustices inflicted on him by the suitors.  </p>

The verb <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> is used at O.19.535 in the imperative, and the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>, is in the accusative; likewise at O.19.555, <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> takes the accusative of the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>. This verb is derived from <em>krinein</em>/<em>krinesthai</em>, the basic meaning of which is ‘separate, distinguish, judge’.

It is a question of interpreting-in-performance. In the middle voice, <em>hupo-krinestha</em>i suggests that the performer is interpreting for himself as well as for others. The basic idea of <em>hupo-krinesthai</em>, then, is to see the real meaning of what others see and to quote back, as it were, what this vision is really telling them. Such a vision distinguishes what is real from what is unreal.  </p>

# Odyssey 19.547

<p>In Penelope’s dream as she reports it here at O.19.547, the talking eagle that dream-interprets itself to be really Odysseus says that this dream is not just any <em>onar</em> or ‘dream’ but rather, more than that, it is a <em>hupar esthlon </em>or ‘waking reality’ (οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλ&#x27; ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν). The reality that is being foretold in the dream here at O.19.547 is signaled by the word <em>hupar</em>, which refers to a dream that is seen when one is asleep but will also be seen after one is awake, as opposed to the word <em>onar</em> (also <em>oneiros</em>), which refers to a dream seen only in sleep. (The word <em>hupar</em> is cognate with the element <em>suppar</em>- of the Hittite verb <em>suppariya</em>- ‘sleep’: see DELG under ὕπαρ.) The reality foretold by a dream that is <em>hupar</em> is reinforced here at O.19.547 by the epithet <em>esthlon</em> ‘real, genuine, good’, which is derived from the root <em>es</em>- ‘to be’ as in <em>esti</em> ‘is’. The vision signaled by the <em>hupar esthlon</em> or ‘waking reality’, as I have translated it, will come to fulfillment, that is, <em>it will reach its real outcome</em>, as expressed by the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’. Imperfective uses of this verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ refer to realities that are still in the making, that have not yet come to fulfillment: see for example the comment at I.02.330. Perfective uses of this same word, on the other hand, refer to a reality that has come to fulfillment. Here at O.19.547, we see a future perfect use: the talking eagle of the dream is foretelling a reality that will have already happened when the right moment in the narrative finally arrives. This verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’, as used here at O.19.547, focuses on a central idea in contexts of composition-in-performance. The idea is this: whatever is being said in the performance will come to fulfillment in the composition when all is said and done.  </p>

# Odyssey 19.562-569

<p>In the response of Penelope, O.19.562–569, to the response of Odysseus in interpreting her dream, she says that there are two kinds of dreams, passing through two kinds of <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’, O.19.562: the first kind passes through a gate of <em>keras</em> ‘horn’, and the second kind, through a gate of <em>elephas</em> ‘ivory’, O.19.563. The first kind signals what is real, while the second, what is deceptive. That is why the mental power of distinguishing what is real from what is unreal becomes so seriously important. But there is also a playful side to these images of horn and ivory, as reflected in the word play that links (1) the noun <em>keras</em> ‘horn’ with the verb <em>krainein</em> in the sense of ‘authorize as real’, O.19.567, and (2) the noun <em>elephas</em> ‘ivory’ with the verb <em>elephairesthai</em> in the sense of ‘deceive’, O.19.565. The object of the verb <em>krainein</em> ‘authorize as real’ here is <em>etuma</em> ‘real things’ (ἔτυμα), O.19.567: that is what dreams from a Gate of Horn will bring. Correspondingly, the object of what is brought by dreams from a Gate of ivory is <em>a-kráan-ta</em> ‘unauthorized’ (ἀκράαντα), O.19.565. The playfulness extends further: I suspect that the symbolism of <em>keras</em> ‘horn’ here involves not only the elevated sense of ‘authorization’ but also the earthy sense of sexual desire. I suspect that the Aphrodisiac properties linked with horn as a substance are in play here. Perhaps relevant is all the folkore surrounding the earthy English adjective ‘horny’. When I speak of ‘horn’ here, I have in mind primarily the <em>kerata</em> ‘antlers’ of deer, the aphrodisiac properties of which are highlighted for example by the physician Galen (vol. 14 p. 240 ed. C. G. Kühn 1827). I ask myself: why does Penelope cry and cry in her dream about losing her geese? Perhaps her familiarity with the geese can be linked with her familiarity—however unwelcome—with the suitors. The geese have been around for twenty years, and where was the eagle during all this time? Perhaps that is why it is safe for Penelope to offer a recusal at O.19.568–569: surely my dream came from a Gate of Ivory, not from a Gate of Horn. For more on Penelope’s dream, I strongly recommend the analysis of Levaniouk 2011:229–246, with a critical survey of the multifarious interpretations that have been offered over the years by experts and nonexperts alike.  </p>

Or maybe my death should be even worse? Penelope is now haunted by horror stories about unfortunate girls who thought they were getting married but who instead became servants to infernal Furies. She cries for them and she cries for herself, thinking of a dream she had about sleeping with Odysseus, who was looking the way he had looked twenty years ago. Her crying carries over till daybreak, and her laments are overheard from not that far away by Odysseus, who is having his own dark thoughts about the vengeance he so passionately desires.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/T11215_10_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“The Harpies Going to Seize the Daughters of Pandareus” (1805).

# Odyssey 20.061-080

<p>In a despondent mood, unable to fall asleep, Penelope prays to the goddess Artemis, wishing for a death that should happen <em>ēdē</em> ‘already now’, O.20.061 (ἤδη), that is, <em>autika</em> <em>nūn</em> ‘right this instant’, O.20.063 (αὐτίκα νῦν). Such a death, if it is to happen ‘right this instant’, would come from arrows shot by Artemis, O.20.061–063. And such an instantaneous death would thus happen before Penelope were to be forced into marrying one of the suitors. Alternatively, however, the death that she wishes for could happen at a later point, as indicated by way of the expression <em>ē</em> <em>epeita</em> ‘or later’, O.20.063 (ἢ ἔπειτα). In the case of such a postponed death, the sequence of events would have already reached a moment where a forced marriage has already been arranged for an unwilling Penelope—and where the wedding is already about to take place. Penelope’s alternative wish to die at such a later moment, right before an actual wedding, pictures the same kind of death that had been experienced once upon a time by the daughters of Pandareos, whose story will now be retold, starting at O.20.066. The retelling of this story from a distant past will be worded by Penelope herself, who will now make a comparison between what had happened to the daughters of Pandareos and what she imagines will eventually happen in her own story if she is forced to marry one of the suitors. Here is the wording that introduces the comparison between the dreaded future of Penelope and the dreaded past of the daughters of Pandareos. A moment in that past time is described most ominously here: ‘just as when gusts of wind [<em>thúellai</em>] took away [<em>an-heleîn</em>] the daughters of Pandareos’, O.20.066 (ὡς δ&#x27; ὅτε Πανδαρέου κούρας ἀνέλοντο θύελλαι). So, just as the daughters of Pandareos had been taken away by gusts of wind right before their wedding, so also Penelope, in her prayer, wishes for a comparable death if she cannot die right away. Here is how she says it: ‘or later [<em>ē epeita</em>] may a gust of wind [<em>thúella</em>], snatch me away [<em>an-harpáxāsa</em>]...’, O.20.063 (ἢ ἔπειτά μ’ ἀναρπάξασα θύελλα), ‘... and drop me into the forward-flowing streams of the Ōkeanos’, O.20.063–065 (ἐν προχοῇς βάλοι ... Ὠκεανοῖο). This world-encircling river Ōkeanos, as we have already seen in other Homeric contexts, separates the living from the dead. See especially the comment at O.10.508–512: <em>to cross the streams of the Ōkeanos is to cross into Hādēs</em>. So, if Penelope cannot be granted her first wish, which is, to die right now, shot to death by the arrows of Artemis, then the wording of her prayer allows her to ask for her alternative second wish, which is, to experience death before any wedding is arranged against her will. But how does such a wedding, dreaded by Penelope, compare with the wedding that had been arranged for the daughters of Pandareos? At O.20.073–076, we see that the divinity who was arranging for these girls to get married was Aphrodite, seemingly acting as a sole agent. Earlier, at O.20.067–069, we see that Aphrodite had saved the girls from dying after their parents had been destroyed by the gods: it seems that the orphan girls were still infants, and Aphrodite raised them on a diet of cheese, honey, and wine, O.20.068–069. As the little orphans, saved by Aphrodite, were growing up, other female deities took part in raising them: (1) Hērā gave them beauty and intelligence, O.20.070–071, (2) Artemis gave them just the right dimensions to grow into, O.20.71, and (3) Athena gave them skills, O.20.072—which surely included expertise in weaving. But then, at a point where the girls are already so perfectly ready for marriage—a marriage that Aphrodite had personally arranged for them—they are snatched away by violent gusts of wind, O.20.077, which deliver them to <em>Erīnues</em> ‘Furies’ whom they are now destined to serve as attendants, O.20.078. And the removal of the girls from the visible world is described here in wording that is more violent than the wording that had previously described the death wished by Penelope for herself. Penelope’s wording had referred to a <em>thúella</em> ‘gust of wind’ that would snatch her away from the visible world, O.20.063, and carry her off to the Ōkeanos, where she would cross into the realm of Hādēs. But now, at O.20.077, the gusts of winds that snatch away the daughters of Pandareos are <em>hárpuiai</em>, and the violence of these gusts of wind is evident in the English word that is used to translate the personifications of these ‘rapacious gusts of wind’. These personified gusts of wind are the <em>Harpies</em>. And the death of these unfortunate girls who were seized by the Harpies is then followed by a horrific afterlife, imagined as an eternity of servitude to <em>Erīnues</em> ‘Furies’, O.20.078. How, then, to account for the dreaded fate of the daughters of Pandareos? Something went very wrong here. Although the Homeric narrative gives no details about the identity of the bridegrooms intended for these would-be brides, I suspect that there was something wrong with them in particular—and that the sole agency of Aphrodite in arranging for the would-be wedding, seemingly to the exclusion of Hērā, Artemis, and Athena, signals what might have gone wrong for the daughters of Pandareos. Whatever it was that did go wrong for these doomed girls, Penelope says that the infernal fate that awaited them is for her still preferable to the dreaded prospect of her getting married off to any of the suitors. Before I can bring this analysis to a close, I must return here to the wording <em>ē epeita</em> at O.20.063, which I have translated simply as ‘or later’. <em>The function of this wording can easily be misunderstood if we lose track of the ring composition that is activated at this point</em>. Penelope wishes for an immediate death caused by the shafts of Artemis, O.20.061–063, or a delayed death caused by the abducting winds, O.20.63–65. At O.20.066, the story about the abduction of the daughters of Pandareos is introduced as a precedent. The story is further developed at O.20.067–076, climaxed at O.20.077, where we see a recap of O.22.066. Then the line at O.20.079 recaps Penelope&#x27;s wish for a delayed death, and, to close out the ring composition, the line at O.22.080 recaps her original wish for an immediate death. So, the force of <em>ē epeita</em> ‘or later&#x27; in expressing a delayed death at O.20.063 is that the winds would snatch Penelope away at a later point in the presumed narrative, <em>right before her marriage to one of the suitors</em>, just as the Harpies abducted the daughters of Pandareos <em>right before the arranged marriage of these doomed girls</em>, O.20.073–074. My interpretation of <em>ē epeita</em> &#x27;or later&#x27; here at O.20.063 helps explain the connotations of the epithet <em>metakhróniai</em> &#x27;delayed&#x27; as applied to the <em>Hárpuiai</em> ‘Harpies’ at Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 269. </p>

On my interpretation of this ‘wakeful reality’, see the note at O.19.547. Penelope’s remembrance of such a dream here validates the reality that is foretold in the dream as narrated and then interpreted at O.19.535–565. See the comment on the lines there.

<p>(What follows is epitomized from HR 55–60 = 3§§20–33.) </p><p>[§20.] At O.20.103–104 Odysseus is praying to Zeus for <em>both</em> an omen <em>and</em> a <em>phēmē</em> ‘something said’ as indications telling him that he will indeed prevail over the suitors.

She is not sure for whom the sign of the god’s thunder is intended, O.20.114 (τεῳ ‘for someone), but she prays to Zeus that he should intend it for her too, O.20.115 (καὶ ἐμοί ‘for me too’) by bringing to fulfillment the <em>epos</em> ‘words’ that she now speaks, O.20.115. The narrative that frames what she says in her prayer likewise refers to the prayer as an <em>epos</em>, adding that this <em>epos</em> is meant to be a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’ for Odysseus, O.20.111.</p><p>[§22.] What the woman is quoted as saying is poetically represented here as a song, as we can see from the reference to “milling songs” in Plutarch <em>Banquet of the Seven Sages</em> 157 (<em>Carmina Popularia</em> [PMG] no. 869): in this case, it is stated explicitly that a woman is heard singing while grinding grain with her handmill. At O.20.111, the poetic representation of singing here is also indicated by way of the word <em>epos</em>, plural <em>epea</em>, which means not just ‘words’ but also specifically ‘poetic words’ in Homeric diction (see the comments on <em>epea</em> ‘words’ at I.12.387–391 and at I.20.248–250; see also GMP 221).</p><p>[§23.] For some interpreters, an irreversible mistake can be found here in what seems to be a contradiction between the words of the narrative framing the <em>phēmē</em> and the words of the “quoted” <em>phēmē</em> itself. In the words of the <em>phēmē</em> as spoken by the woman, she says that the thundering of Zeus came from the starry sky, O.20.113 (οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος), where no cloud is to be seen, O.20.114 (οὐδέ ποθι νέφος ἐστί ‘and there is not a cloud [<em>nephos</em>] anywhere’). This, then, was the sign that the woman had received: it was a thundering from a clear sky. By contrast, the narrative that frames what she says refers to the thundering of Zeus ‘from ‘radiant Olympus’, O.20.103 (ἀπ᾿ αἰγλήεντος Ὀλύμπου), and the thundering had come ‘from on high, from out of the clouds [<em>nephea</em>]’, O.20.104 (ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων). </p><p>[§24.] Of course, no Homer critic would have any problem if the narrative frame here had been more simple, featuring only one sign—that is, if Odysseus had prayed for only one sign, the thunder of Zeus. The problem seems to arise from the combining of two signs in the narration—the thunder of Zeus and the song of the anonymous woman. It is this combination that has led to what appears to be a contradiction between these two signs. And yet, I propose that the combining of two narrative signs here amounts to an artistic narratological elaboration, which succeeds in producing a special poetic effect by way of juxtaposing the perceptions of the anonymous woman and the perceptions of Odysseus. </p><p>[§25.] For the anonymous woman, only one sign had been needed, the thundering of Zeus, and that is the sign that she had received. For Odysseus, however, the thundering of Zeus was not the complete sign that he had received. It was an incomplete sign. In terms of his own prayer, it had to be completed, complemented, by something that is actually said, which turned out to be the words of the woman. Those words, however, could not become a completed <em>phēmē</em> for Odysseus unless Zeus heeded those words on their own terms, on the woman’s terms. For the woman, the thundering of Zeus came from a clear sky. For Odysseus, the same thundering had come from a clouded sky, and the message of Zeus became clear only after the woman received her own message from a clear sky. The wording of the woman, an incipient <em>epos</em> that was as yet unclear for her, became a finished <em>epos</em> that was indeed clear for Odysseus, just as the thundering of Zeus shifted perceptually from a clouded to a clear sky. For Odysseus, the clarification and hence the fulfillment of the <em>epos</em> of the woman makes this <em>epos</em> into a genuine prophetic utterance: the <em>phēmē</em> ‘thing said’ as it is called at O.20.100 and at O.20.105 turns out to be a <em>kleēdōn</em> ‘prophetic utterance’, as it is finally called at O.20.120. The woman’s words have now become fulfilled as a speech-act. Her speech—or song—has now become an act of special prophecy, of cledonomancy. At the moment of fulfillment, Odysseus rejoices at both omens: (1) the prophetic utterance, <em>kleēdōn</em>, and (2) the thundering of Zeus. Here is the wording: ‘he rejoiced at the <em>kleēdōn</em> | and at the thundering of Zeus’, O.20.120–121 (χαῖρεν δὲ κλεηδόνι ... | Ζηνός τε βροντῇ).</p><p>[§26.] The prophecy, of course, starts with Zeus, whose thundering is in itself the primal act that leads to the cledonomancy. Zeus himself is ultimately prophetic in his manifestations of weather, and his meaning can be ambivalently bright or dark, clear or cloudy, positive or negative. The Indo-European form *<em>di̯eu</em>-, which becomes Greek <em>Zeus</em> (Ζεύς), means basically ‘sky’, thus conveying a cledonomantic ambivalence: it portends either clear or clouded weather. Despite this ambivalence of clear or clouded, positive or negative, in the meaning ‘sky’, the Indo-European noun *<em>di̯eu</em>- stems from the verb *<em>diu̯</em>-, which has only the positive meaning ‘be bright / clear’, not the negative ‘be dark / cloudy’. The darkness and the clouds show the other side of Zeus.</p><p>[§27.] There is a similar cledonomantic ambivalence in the meaning of the Indo-European form *<em>nebhos</em>, which becomes Greek <em>nephos</em> (νέφος) ‘cloud’: it means basically ‘cloud’ in ambivalently good or bad weather. This ambivalence explains the fact that in some Indo-European languages the derivative of *<em>nebhos</em> means primarily ‘sky’, by way of metonymy. Such is the case with Russian <em>nebo</em> ‘sky’. Thus in Russian idiom, <em>na nebe ni oblaka</em> means ‘there’s not a cloud [<em>oblako</em>] in the sky [<em>nebo</em>]’. From the standpoint of Indo-European linguistics, we see here a new word for ‘cloud’, <em>oblako</em>, while the old word for ‘cloud’ has become, metonymically, the new word for ‘sky’. This new word can even stand for a cloudless sky, as in the idiom we have just seen: <em>na nebe ni oblaka</em> means ‘there’s not a cloud [<em>oblako</em>] in the sky [<em>nebo</em>]’. </p><p>[§28.] Such a metonymic sense of Indo-European *<em>nebhos</em> as ‘sky’ is visible also in some Homeric usages of the noun <em>nephos</em> / <em>nephea</em> ‘cloud’ / ‘clouds’, which is potentially ambivalent in its own right concerning questions of good or bad weather. When Zeus thunders ‘from on high, from out of the clouds [<em>nephea</em>]’ at O.20.105 (ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων), he is thundering from the sky, through the metonymy of the clouds. In this case, the ambivalence of clouds or sky is canceled only by the explicit statement, in the words of the singing woman at 20.114, that there is no <em>nephos</em> ‘cloud’ in the sky. In all other Homeric attestations, the potential metonymic sense of <em>nephos</em> / <em>nephea</em> as ‘sky’ can remain in force. A particularly striking example of this metonymic sense of ‘sky’ is evident at I.13.523–524, where Zeus is pictured as sitting in grand isolation on the summit of Olympus, under a shining canopy of ‘golden <em>nephea</em>’ (ἀλλ᾿ ὁ γὰρ ἄκρῳ Ὀλύμπῳ ὑπὸ χρυσέοισι νέφεσσιν | ἦστο). At that moment in the narrative, the god is described as ‘wrapped up’ in his own thoughts, which are conventionally called the Will of Zeus, I.13.524 (Διὸς βουλῇσιν ἐελμένος). The scholia V for O.20.104 actually cite this Iliadic passage, explaining the usage of <em>nephea</em> at O.20.104 in terms of metonymy. A similar explanation is offered in Scholia BQ: that the word <em>nephea</em> at O.20.102 is to be understood as referring to a realm where clouds can be expected to happen.</p><p>[§29.] I propose that the theme of the Will of Zeus, as a conventional plot device of Homeric narrative, is essential for understanding the double omen of Zeus’ thunder and the woman’s song in the <em>Odyssey</em>. I propose, further, that the weather in this passage of the <em>Odyssey</em> depends on the Will of Zeus, and that the sudden shift from a cloudy to a clear sky is a choice in Homeric narratology, not a mistake in Homeric meteorology.</p><p>[§30.] Moreover, the sudden shift from cloudy to clear skies can happen only after the narrative makes it clear that there is not a cloud in the sky. Before that clarification, it was left unclear whether or not the sky was cloudy. If the thundering of Zeus comes out of a clear blue sky, it is a bigger omen than if it comes out of a cloudy sky. If Odysseus had prayed for just one omen, not two, it would not be clear whether the thundering of Zeus had happened in cloudy or in clear weather. Since he prayed for two omens, however, and since the second omen was granted, now everything is clear, and the prophecy is augmented.</p><p>[§31.] The shift from a clouded sky to a clear one depends on the clarification of the Will of Zeus in the course of the narrative. Further, the <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’ meant by Zeus for Odysseus at O.20.111 depends implicitly on the faculty for both encoding and decoding it, and that faculty is conventionally expressed by the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ and the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ (see the anchor comment at I.05.669). The <em>nóos</em> or ‘intentionality’ of Zeus is key to understanding the plot-constructions of Homeric narrative. In the <em>Iliad</em>, for example, when Zeus expresses his Will by nodding his head, I.01.524–527, Hērā reacts by chiding him for not telling what it is that he really intends—literally, for not making an <em>epos</em> out of what he ‘has in his <em>nóos</em>’, as expressed by the verb <em>noeîn</em> at I.01.543. Zeus replies that the <em>mūthos</em> ‘wording’ that he ‘has in his <em>nóos</em>’ as expressed again by <em>noeîn</em> at I.01.549, is for him alone to know. And yet, the Homeric audience may already know, since the <em>Iliad</em> declares programmatically that its plot <em>is</em> the Will of Zeus, I.01.005. See the comment at that line (see also GMP 222).</p><p>[§32.] To sum up, I repeat my earlier formulation: when Zeus thunders ‘from on high, from out of the clouds [<em>nephea</em>]’ at O.20.105 (ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων), he is essentially thundering from the sky, through the metonymy of the clouds. This poetic description in the framing narrative does not contradict, per se, the later perception of a clear sky within the framed speech, O.20.114: ‘and there is not a cloud [<em>nephos</em>] anywhere’ (οὐδέ ποθι νέφος ἐστί). But that later perception does indeed clarify the earlier narrative perception of a sky that <em>may</em> be clouded over. Now the sky is clear, as the cledonomantic words have finally been clarified.</p><p>[§33.] The time has come to rethink the passage I have analyzed here in terms of oral poetics, not just poetics per se. I hold that the complexities of this passage reflect the accretions of a highly sophisticated oral poetic tradition that kept on continually recombining its older and its newer elements in the productive phases of its evolution. These older and newer elements may at times seem to contradict each other if we stop and view each of them as individual parts, but I suggest that such contradictions were transcended by the actual re-combinations of these parts into the totality of an ongoing system that we know as Homeric poetry. In order to account for such an ongoing system, I developed my evolutionary model for the making of Homeric poetry. For more on such a model, see the comment at I.12.335–336 and at I.13.066; also the Excursus on O.13.158.   </p>

<p>The feasting that we see being described here at O.20.276–280 involves the whole <em>astu</em> ‘city’ of Ithaca, O.20.276, and, as we see in the wording of O.20.276–277, all this feasting climaxes in a <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, as proclaimed throughout the city by <em>kērūkes</em> ‘heralds’. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, a priestly word referring to the sacrifice of one hundred cattle, see the comment on O.04.351–353. The occasion for this hecatomb is evidently a <em>festival of Apollo</em>, signaled by the vivid description at O.20.277–278: the Achaeans are now seen assembling inside the sacred <em>alsos</em> ‘grove’ of the god Apollo, O.20.278. What follows after the sacrifice of a hundred cattle is then described at O.20.279–280: the meat is cooked and divided among the participants. And the whole occasion of this feasting is indicated at O.20.280 by way of two all-important words here: (1) <em>dais</em> ‘feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’, and (2) <em>daiesthai</em> ‘feast; divide (meat), apportion, distribute’. On <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ as a stylized way of referring to an overall <em>festival</em>, see the introductory comments at O.08.038 and at O.08.061; also the follow-up comments at O.08.429, O.09.003–111, O.13.023.

Although the end of the passge, “for they were the first to contrive unseemly things” (O.20.394), appears to explain the meal’s lack of <em>kharis </em>as a result of Athena’s and Odysseus’ initiative in unjust machinations, according to Penelope, the suitors have done <em>ἀεικέα ἔργα</em>, “unseemly deeds,” before this.

<p>Toward the end of Rhapsody 21, Odysseus will pass an all-important test set by Penelope: he will string his famous bow—which none of the suitors could string, no matter how hard they tried—and he will shoot an arrow straight through all the holes of twelve axe-heads lined up in a row for this one-time occasion, designed to be viewed as the contest to end all contests in the skills of archery. This contest will determine, once and for all, who is really eligible, among all the Achaeans, to be recognized as the husband of the queen. But the winning of this ultimate contest by Odysseus is not enough: the king must now kill, with the same bow, all the would-be husbands of the queen. So, once Odysseus passes the test set by Penelope, as narrated toward the end of Rhapsody 21, the killing of the rival Achaeans can begin in Rhapsody 22. And the overall occasion for both the passing of Penelope’s test and the killing of the suitors is the beginning of a grand festival celebrating the god Apollo and the arrival of spring. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Thebes_Heracles_bow_74000209.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Hēraklēs stringing a bow.

# Odyssey 21.11-41

<p>  </p><p>The inset narrative of how Odysseus came to have the bow that Penelope challenges the suitors to string and shoot with in order to win her hand has (as often for inset narratives in the Homeric poems) layers of meaning relevant to the main narrative. The bow is a gift of friendship from Iphitus, whom Odysseus meets while in Messene to collect a debt owed by the Messenians: they had taken three hundred sheep and their shepherds from Ithaca. Iphitus likewise is in search of twelve lost mares. The situation framing their encounter sets out a model for how reciprocation should work, even if “negative” as here, starting in theft: Odysseus is due recompense for the three hundred sheep and their shepherds. The theft of the sheep and shepherds parallels the suitors’ slaughtering of and feasting on Odysseus’ livestock and abuse of his household. </p><p></p><p>The suitable recompense for the suitors’ arrogance is foreshadowed in the story of the bow, as well. The twelve mares that Iphitus has come to reclaim turn out to be his undoing when Herakles kills him to keep the mares. Herakles does this while a guest in Iphitus’ house, without regard for the fact that he is offered food there – and without regard for the <em>opis </em>of the gods (<em>Od</em>. 21.28: <em>σχέτλιος, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν αἰδέσατ’</em>, “merciless one, and he did not fear the <em>opis</em> of gods”). Watkins (1977) has shown that <em>opis</em> is synonymous with <em>mēnis</em>. In comparing this line with a nearly identical one in Hesiod’s <em>Works and Days</em> (<em>σχέτλιοι, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν εἰδότες</em>, “merciless ones, and they did not know the <em>opis</em> of gods,” 187) where the transgressions incurring the <em>opis</em> are also listed<em>, </em>it is evident that divine retribution for transgression against the rules that maintain the cosmic order is meant. The scene between Herakles and Iphitus is one of hospitality (<em>Od</em>. 21.28-29), which parallels the situation between the suitors and Odysseus in the main narrative. Just as Herakles in the inset narrative breaks the rules of hospitality, so in the framing narrative do the suitors. Where the inset narrative contrasts with the main narrative is in the punishment: unlike Herakles, the suitors do not get out scot-free. The instrument of their undoing is the bow, the weapon that gives rise to this inset narrative. It is a gift of friendship (<em>Od</em>. 21.35), and as Seaford (1994) notes, it embodies the relationship of guest-friendship and the rules of hospitality; as such, it is an appropriate punisher for the abuse of hospitality. I would like to add that we are even told that Odysseus does not take this bow with him when he goes to Troy, but leaves it at home as a <em>μνῆμα ξείνοιο φίλοιο</em>, “a reminder of a dear guest-friend” (<em>Odyssey</em> 21.40). Appropriately, in a further way, then, the instrument of the suitors’ punishment embodies also the memory that leads to good conduct as a marker and upholder of a relationship of exchanging <em>kharites</em>, the reciprocal exchange of good turns. </p><p></p><p>  </p><p>See further: </p><p></p><p>Muellner, Leonard. 1996. <em>The Anger of Achilles: Mênis in Greek Epic</em>.

<p>Telemachus recognizes here that the praise deserved by Penelope is self-evident, in the sense that the word <em>ainos</em> here can mean ‘praise’. What is less clear, however, is whether he fully recognizes—as of yet—the right words to use for encoding and decoding what should be said about his mother. The further meaning of <em>ainos</em> as ‘coded words’ leaves room for such lack of full clarity.  </p>

<p>The story about the drunken and reckless behavior of the Centaur Eurytion when he was a guest of Perithoos and his Lapiths is embedded in a morally flawed mental exercise here. The narrator of the story is Antinoos, whose behavior as a bad guest is comparable to that of the Centaur, but the suitor is perversely comparing the behavior of the Centaur to that of Odysseus. Antinoos is feeling outraged that a lowly beggar would dare to compete with the suitors as Odysseus prepares to string the bow, and so the suitor warns the disguised king at O.21.305–306, threatening that Odysseus will receive the same cruel punishment that was once upon a time received by the Centaur at the hands of his outraged hosts. On the horrific details of this punishment, see the anchor comment at O.18.085–087 on extreme cruelty in Homeric narrative.  </p>

# Odyssey 21.404-21.411

<p>Odysseus effortlessly strings his bow, O.21.409, and this feat of strength for a warrior in stringing his weapon is now compared to a feat of skill for a singer who effortlessly strings his musical instrument, which is here a <em>phorminx</em>, a special lyre played by the singer in accompanying his <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’, O.21.406. Next, Odysseus tests the tautness of his bowstring, plucking it, and the sound that emanates from the string is said to be like a song: the string literally ‘sings’, as expressed by the verb <em>hup–aeidein</em> ‘sing [<em>aedein</em>] while accompanying [<em>hupo</em>-]’, O.21.411. The bowstring ‘sings’ like a singer who sings while accompanying himself by playing on the strings of his lyre. So, the sound of the bowstring that is plucked matches not only the sound of the strings on a lyre that are being plucked by the singer as he sings but also the sound of the singer’s voice. The metaphor is complex, since the comparison with the sound of the taut bowstring combines the sound of a musical instrument with the sound of the human voice. And the complexity is now intensified by the addition of a simile that follows the metaphor: this sound of the plucked bowstring, first compared by way of metaphor to the sound of a singer’s voice combined with the sound of the strings that he plucks in accompaniment of his song, is next compared, by way of simile, to the sound of the singing of a swallow, O.21.411. This singing of the swallow heralds not only the coming of spring but also the occasion that inaugurates this season of renewal, which is, a festival sacred to Apollo. See the anchor comment at O.20.276–280 on the festival of Apollo.  </p>

# Odyssey 21.429-430

<p>The wording here at O.21.429–430 is a reference to the festival of Apollo, picking up from O.20.276–280. See the anchor comment on those lines. After having successfully accomplished the two feats of stringing the bow and shooting through the holes of the twelve axe-heads, Odysseus can truly say to Telemachus: now is the <em>hōrā</em> ‘season’, O.21.428 (νῦν δ’ ὥρη). As the wording of Odysseus goes on to explain at O.21.429–430, now is the season for ‘the Achaeans’ to be feasting, in daylight, and there will be eating and drinking, also singing and dancing, as expressed by the noun <em>molpē</em> ‘singing-and-dancing’, O.21.430. On <em>molpē</em> as a combination of singing and dancing, see the note at O.04.015–019. Such merriment, as the wording highlights in the same line, O.21.430, is what happens on the occasion of a <em>dais</em> ‘feast. The word is used here in the general sense of ‘feast’, with reference to a <em>stylized festival</em>. On the use of this word <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ elsewhere as well in this general sense, see especially the comments at O.08.429 and at O.13.023; also the comment at O.20.276–289 with specific reference to the festival of Apollo. The overall wording of Odysseus here at O.21.429–430 can be read as good news about good feasting ahead for those in the post-epic future who will be participating in the festival of Apollo—but it is bad news for the suitors, whose perverted feasting in the epic present will soon lead to the carnage that commences in Rhapsody 22. This killing of the suitors, which follows the stringing of the bow and the winning of the ultimate contest in archery, is the third part of an epic mythological complex that functions as an aetiology for the post-epic ritual complex of celebrating the festival of Apollo by happily eating and drinking, singing and dancing. As Odysseus says at O.21.428, the season has arrived for such celebration. It is the season of springtime, and the song of swallows has once again returned to the land, as we saw previously at O.21.411. See again the comment at O.21.404–411. The mythological violence in the epic present will lead to ritual order in the post-epic future as celebrated at the festival of Apollo. For more on the ritualized function of this festival as stylized in the narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>, I recommend the comprehensive analysis of Levaniouk 2011, especially pp. 13–15.  </p>

<p>In the context of a future celebration, taking place in a post-heroic age at the festival of Apollo, the term <em>hepsiâsthai</em> ‘mock’ could refer to the ridiculing of the suitors by way of blame poetry. Odysseus as speaker here may be speaking beyond his own epic time, beyond the heroic age, by mocking his rivals for not yet knowing what he already knows full well will happen to them. On the perspectives of a post-heroic age with regard to the festival of Apollo, see the comment at O.22.437–479, where it is argued that the various grim dysfunctionalities that pollute the heroic world in <em>myth</em> are expurgated in the post-heroic world by way of <em>ritual</em>, as in the case of seasonally recurring festivals where primal ordeals are re-enacted in contexts of festive celebration, even merriment.  </p>

<p>At the end of Rhapsody 21, Odysseus has already passed, in rapid succession, two of three successive tests that needed to be endured by the true king of Ithaca. That is, he has already performed a stringing of his mighty bow and has already won an ultimate contest in archery by executing a perfect shot with the very first arrow that he shoots from the bow. But now, at the beginning of Rhapsody 22, the third test awaits Odysseus. He must now kill the suitors, and the successive killings that follow will ultimately eliminate all the would-be husbands of Penelope. In the end, Odysseus will be the only Achaean left standing. And he has by now been revealed as the only true husband, the only true king. So, he has become the best of the Achaeans in the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>. But a question remains. Now that all the suitors have been killed, what will happen to the other characters in the <em>Odyssey</em> who had turned against the king in the course of his lengthy absence? Here is where things get really ugly. The extreme cruelty of the retribution that awaits these characters, as we see it narrated here in <em>Odyssey</em> 22, presents the modern reader with moral problems that cannot be evaded. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Attic_red-figure_skyphos%E2%80%94Odysseus_slays_the_suitors_of_his_wife_Penelope_1280.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Odysseus kiling Penelope’s suitors.

But now, at the beginning of Rhapsody 22, the third test awaits Odysseus. He must now kill the suitors. The king shows no hesitation. Having just won the contest in archery with the very first arrow that he shoots after stringing his mighty bow, he now goes on to aim his next arrow at Antinoos, who has been by far the worst of those leftover Achaeans of Ithaca. Odysseus shoots the arrow, and it hits the mark: Antinoos is instantly killed, O.22.008–021. The successive arrows, each one of them, will also hit the mark, and he keeps on shooting until there are no arrows left, O.22.116–119. Then, after Odysseus has run out of arrows to shoot, he arms himself with his armor for hand-to-hand combat, O.22.120–125.

Correspondingly, the transition from Rhapsody 21 to Rhapsody 22 shows no hesitation: the shooting of the first arrow, which wins the contest in archery at the end of one rhapsody, is followed immediately by the shooting of the next arrow that kills Antinoos here in the next rhapsody—to be followed in turn by the successive killings that will ultimately eliminate all the other would-be husbands of Penelope.  </p>

# Odyssey 22.001-007

<p>Here at O.22.001–007 is the moment when Odysseus finally strips off the rags of a beggar and stands tall at the threshold as he scatters at his feet the arrows from his quiver. He will now pick up the arrows, one by one, and shoot them at the suitors. And he starts by taking aim at Antinoos. In Plato’s <em>Ion</em>, this moment is treated as the greatest of all scenes pictured in Homeric poetry. In a conversation with the rhapsode Ion, who specializes in the performance of Homeric poetry, Plato’s Socrates is making a mental list of what he considers to be the greatest Homeric scenes. First place in the list goes to the moment that we see here at the beginning of Rhapsody 22, where Odysseus stands at the threshold and pours the arrows from his quiver. This moment in the <em>Odyssey</em>, as we see in the order of mention by Plato’s Socrates, outranks even the greatest moment in the <em>Iliad</em>, which gets only second place. The Iliadic moment is where Achilles lunges at Hector, evidently for the last time. And third place goes to any one of those moments in the <em>Iliad</em> where Andromache or Hecuba or Priam, in that order, are shown lamenting. In this mental list of Plato’s Socrates, we see two examples of <em>fear</em> or <em>terror</em> and one combined example of <em>pity</em>—two emotions that are considered to be primary in tragedy as analyzed by Aristotle in his <em>Poetics</em>. I quote here the relevant wording, where Plato’s Socrates is speaking directly to the Homeric rhapsode Ion (Plato <em>Ion</em> 535b–c): </p><p>ΣΩ. Ἔχε δή μοι τόδε εἰπέ, ὦ Ἴων, καὶ μὴ ἀποκρύψῃ ὅτι ἄν σε ἔρωμαι· ὅταν εὖ εἴπῃς ἔπη καὶ ἐκπλήξῃς μάλιστα τοὺς θεωμένους, ἢ τὸν Ὀδυσσέα ὅταν ἐπὶ τὸν οὐδὸν ἐφαλλόμενον ᾄδῃς, ἐκφανῆ γιγνόμενον τοῖς μνηστῆρσι καὶ ἐκχέοντα τοὺς ὀιστοὺς πρὸ τῶν ποδῶν, ἢ Ἀχιλλέα ἐπὶ τὸν Ἕκτορα ὁρμῶντα, ἢ καὶ τῶν περὶ Ἀνδρομάχην ἐλεινῶν τι ἢ περὶ Ἑκάβην ἢ περὶ Πρίαμον, τότε πότερον ἔμφρων εἶ ἢ ἔξω {c} σαυτοῦ γίγνῃ καὶ παρὰ τοῖς πράγμασιν οἴεταί σου εἶναι ἡ ψυχὴ οἷς λέγεις ἐνθουσιάζουσα, ἢ ἐν Ἰθάκῃ οὖσιν ἢ ἐν Τροίᾳ ἢ ὅπως ἂν καὶ τὰ ἔπη ἔχῃ; </p><p>SOCRATES: Hold it right there.

<p>Seeing that Odysseus has just now shot an arrow that has killed the suitor Antinoos, the rest of the suitors are feeling outraged, assuming as they do that this killing was accidental, O.22.031–032. They revile Odysseus, whom they still fail to recognize, exclaiming that he has accidentally shot the very best of all the young men in Ithaca, O.22.029–030. In effect, they are delusionally assuming that Odysseus has killed the best of the Achaeans in Ithaca. They exclaim further that they will kill the would-be beggar and feed his corpse to vultures, O.22.030, adding derisively: <em>so, don’t expect to win some prize for this shot of the arrow</em>, O.22.027–028. And the word that is used here at O.22.027 for ‘prize’ is <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>), O.22.027. Whereas the masculine noun <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) refers to the ritualized ‘ordeal’ of competition, as noted in the comment at O.22.005, the neuter noun <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>) ordinarily refers to a ‘prize’ that is won in the competition—as also noted in the comment at O.22.005.  </p>

# Odyssey 22.31-33

<p>Reacting to the death of Antinoos, the remaining suitors were now ‘making likenesses’, as expressed by the verb <em>eïskein</em> ‘make likenesses, liken’, O.22.031. That is, each one of them was ‘making likenesses’ <em>in his own mind</em>. They made things up in their own minds, and these things were not just illusions: they were delusions. They were still imagining that Odysseus was a mere beggar, since he had up to now <em>looked like</em> a beggar. The likeness of Odysseus to a beggar made the suitors imagine something different than what was really happening. They imagined that the shooting of Antinoos must have been a grotesque accident. After all, how would a mere beggar dare to shoot the best of the Achaeans in Ithaca? The suitors’ mistaken way of thinking shows a lack of the mental qualities it would take to recognize Odysseus as the true king, as the best of the Achaeans. By the time Odysseus reveals himself as his true self, it is too late for the suitors. Possession of the mental qualities that they would have needed to have—but did not have—for a timely recognition of Odysseus is expressed here by way of the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’, O.22.032. This verb, derived from <em>nóos</em>, which means basically ‘mind, way of thinking’, signals the capacity to recognize what is true. Such a capacity is characteristic of Alkinoos, who ‘notices’ things about the disguised Odysseus, as expressed by way of the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ at O.08.094 and at O.08.533, where the power of this king to ‘notice’ is what leads ultimately to the self-revelation of Odysseus to the Phaeacians in <em>Odyssey</em> 8. See the comments at O.08.094 and at O.08.533; see also the anchor comment at I.05.669 on noeîn ‘take note (of), notice’. Relevant also is the note at I.13.726–735 about a generalizing statement that is made in those lines: it is said there that a person’s <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, I.13.732, is what enables him or her to ‘recognize’, <em>gignōskein</em>, I.13.734; see also the comment at O.17.292. In the case of Alkinoos, his mental power to ‘notice’ is the motivation for his “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), <em>alkí-noos</em>, ‘he who has the power [<em>alk</em>- as in <em>alkē</em> ‘power’] of mind [<em>nóos</em>]’. By contrast with Alkinoos, whose “speaking name” is positive, Antinoos as the worst of the suitors has a “speaking name” that is negative: <em>antí-noos </em>‘he who has a mind [<em>nóos</em>] that is opposed [<em>anti</em>]’. The opposition between the meanings of these two names may also go deeper, involving the root *<em>nes</em>- in the older sense of ‘return to life and life’: Alkinoos had the mental power to promote such a return, whereas Antinoos was in the end powerless to prevent it (on this point, see also H24H 10§10).  </p>

# Odyssey 22.285-291

<p>At O.22.285–286, the cowherd Philoitios kills the suitor Ktesippos, who had thrown at the disguised Odysseus a most lowly portion of beef as a physical insult that augmented his verbal insults during the feast that followed the sacrifice of one hundred cattle in celebration of the festival of Apollo. See the comment at O.20.292–302. Then at O.22.287–291, having killed the suitor, the cowherd mocks the dead Ktesippos for having mistreated a lowly guest who should have really been the kingly host at the feast celebrating the festival of Apollo. In mocking Ktesippos here, the cowherd resorts to the language of blame: he addresses the dead suitor as ‘son of Poluthersēs’, where this “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Polu-thersēs</em> means ‘he who has much boldness [<em>tharsos</em>]’, O.22.287. Such a name is parallel to <em>Thersītēs</em>, the name of a character in the <em>Iliad</em> who is represented as a blame poet of the worst kind. Philoitios also addresses the dead Ktesippos as <em>philo-kertomos</em> ‘lover of insults, O.22.287. On <em>kertomeîn</em> ‘say words of insult’ as used in the language of blame poetry, see the comments at I.02.256, O.02.323, O.18.350; also at O.20.263.  </p>

Although Odysseus does not believe him and slays him, Leiodes’ words confirm the conventionality of the thought: good deeds deserve good <em>kharis </em>in return, and when that does not happen, the social system is being perverted.</p>

# Odyssey 22.437-22.479

<p>At O.22.437–473, the disloyal handmaidens of the household are executed by hanging. There is considerable emphasis on the terror and suffering of these wretched women as they get strung up in a row, twisting and turning in their agony, O.22.471–473. Those who participate in the execution are Telemachus, the cowherd Philoitios, and the swineherd Eumaios; Odysseus too is present. Then at O.22.474–479 follows the punishment of the goatherd Melanthios: his nose and his ears are chopped off, then his genitalia are ‘pulled out’, to be fed to the dogs, and then, finally, his hands and his feet are also chopped off. After these torments, it appears that he is left still alive. Participating in this horrific retribution are the cowherd Philoitios and the swineherd Eumaios. It is not clear in this case whether Telemachus is also participating, but it is clear enough from O.22.479 that Odysseus is no longer present. In any case, as I noted in the anchor comment at O.18.085–087 with specific reference to the extreme cruelty involved in the punishment of the goatherd, an explanation is needed for understanding how the supposedly righteous adherents of Odysseus could inflict horrors that were parallel to the horrors inflicted by the mysteriously infernal Ekhetos, as recounted in ghastly detail at O.18.085–087. In the anchor comment, I already indicated that at least one part of the explanation may involve the words of Antinoos at O.21.300–301 concerning a comparable mutilation inflicted on the Centaur Eurytion. But we are still left with the moral problem of the extreme cruelty at work here. Addressing this problem, I now turn to another part of my explanation, which involves what I described in the comment at I.23.001–064 as <em>a dynamic tension between dysfunctionality in the heroic world of myth and functionality in the post-heroic world of ritual</em>. I find it significant, in this regard, that the main agents of extreme cruelty in the narrative about the punishment inflicted on Melanthios are herdsmen, just as Melanthios himself is a herdsman. This pastoral context is relevant, I think, to the cruelty described in the narrative of O.22.474–479, which takes place in the festive setting of a festival that is sacred to Apollo. This festival, after all, is a pastoral celebration, centering on the sacrifice of a hundred cattle. For further pastoral details, I refer again to the anchor comment at O.20.276–280 on the festival of Apollo. But this festival as narrated here in Rhapsody 22 is not yet a ritually correct event: a correction can come about only in the post-heroic age, when the pollutions of the heroic age that happen in myth, including all the horrific cruelty, are purified year after year, into eternity, by way of festive re-enactment in ritual. The pastoral festivities of a festival of Apollo in the post-heroic world of ritual can now transcend the horrors that still pollute the heroic world of myth. But the first steps in purifying the pollution are already being taken in the myth, since Odysseus insists on the fumigation of his household in the aftermath of all the carnage. In my overall explanation, I have been emphasizing the festivities that mark the occasion of any festival, and this emphasis is relevant to a most telling insight shown by Plato when he looks into one of the most horrific of all narratives in Greek mythology. I am thinking here of the myth about Marsyas, a satyr who was an ultimate master in the art of playing the double-reed known as the <em>aulos</em>. According to this myth, Marsyas was skinned alive by the god Apollo, that ultimate master in the art of playing the lyre known as the <em>kitharā</em>. In Plato’s <em>Symposium</em> 2015a–b, we can see how the extreme violence of Apollo in the world of myth, where he strips the skin from the body of Marsyas, is counterbalanced by the festive merriment of discovering what is under the skin of Marsyas in the world of ritual. In the passage that I have just cited from the <em>Symposium</em>, the speaker is Alcibiades, and he is comparing the external ugliness of Socrates to that of Marsyas—but here the focus is on the Marsyas of ritual, not of myth. As we now learn, there used to be a festive custom of making hollow figurines of Marsyas that contained in the inside the smaller figurines of gods. I infer that the defining god that was hidden in the inside of Marsyas was Apollo himself, so that, when you peeled off the Marsyas on the outside of the figurine, you found the god Apollo on the inside. Thus, the grim violence of the myth is purified here in the festive merriment of a ritual celebrating Apollo. There could be many parallels I could draw from other festive customs as we find them world-wide—perhaps my favorite is what I could fancifully call the “John Barleycorn Syndrome”—but I content myself here with presenting my formulation in its most basic form. Of course, the shock of the violence in myth remains, and I cannot exorcise it in my own mind, but at least it is expurgated by the merriment in ritual. A similar explanation could be attempted in the case of those wretched women who were caught in that snare, O.22.471–473, since they are compared to <em>kikhlai</em> ‘thrushes’ and <em>peleiai</em> ‘pigeons’ at O.22.468. These birds get comparably snared—but the difference is, they are caught in order to be cooked and eaten as delicacies.  </p>

<p>Odysseus instructs his dear ones, together with the household servants, to make merry by singing and dancing, led off by the singing of Phemios to the tune of the lyre. It is as if they were all attending a feast in celebration of a wedding. Such a pretend-feast in heroic-time, where the purpose is to fool those on the outside of the royal household who would start to retaliate if they only knew what had really happened to the suitors on the inside, would be a <em>mock feast</em>, of course. But such a mock feast could also be seen as a preview, as it were, of the merry feasting that will happen at a seasonally recurring festival of Apollo in post-heroic time. By now the feasting would be real, no longer mock feasting—except insofar as the merriment at the feast would be mocking the misfortunes of the suitors while celebrating the eternally recycled sacred wedding of a righteous king and queen. On the epic stylization of Apollo’s festival, see the anchor comment at O.20.276–280; also the comments at O.21.404–411, O.21.429–430, O.21.429, O.22.285–291, O.22.437–479.

Such a simile fuses the picturing of blossoms woven together in a garland with the picturing of the hair that is adorned by the garland. Similarly at I.17.051–052, the droplets of blood that are splattered over a dead hero’s locks of hair evoke a picturing of myrtle blossoms, but the simile here compares the locks themselves, not the droplets of blood, with the blossoms.

# Odysseus 23.163

<p>After a ritual bath in an <em>asaminthos</em> ‘bathtub’, O.23.163, Odysseus is described this way: ‘he [= Odysseus] emerged from the bathtub [<em>asaminthos</em>], looking the same as [<em>homoios</em>] the immortals in shape’ (ἔκ ῥ’ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ δέμας ἀθανάτοισιν ὁμοῖος). For parallel wording in a description of Telemachus emerging from a ritual bath in an <em>asaminthos</em> ‘bathtub’, see O.03.468 and the comment at O.03.464–468. For <em>homoio</em>- in the sense of ‘same as’ in a similar ritual context, signaling an epiphany, see the comment on O.16.172–212. At this point, Odysseus no longer looks like a middle-aged man: in his present ritual context, he looks like a perfect bridegroom, at the perfect age for a perfect wedding. Thus he looks like the Odysseus who slept with Penelope in her dream as described at O.20.087–090: in her wakeful agonizing, unable to fall asleep, Penelope had recalled a dream she once had: there she was, lying in bed with Odysseus at her side, and he was looking the way he had looked when she had last seen him twenty years earlier. It seemed to her then, she says at O.20.090, that this was not an <em>onar</em> ‘dream’ but a <em>hupar esthlon</em> ‘wakeful reality’ (οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλ’ ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν). But now at O.23.163, as Odysseus emerges from his ritual bath looking like a perfect bridegroom, that dream of Penelope is about to become a wakeful reality.   </p>

# Odyssey 23.242

<p>The “he/she thought of other things” (ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε) formula ordinarily signals a change of scene or turn of the plot in a substantially new direction (see <em>Odyssey </em>2.382). Here, exceptionally, it marks a continuation of the current scene: Athena devises a way to <em>avoid</em> a narrative shift. The remarkable reversal of normal usage draws attention to the passage that follows (<em>Odyssey</em><em> </em>23.247-343), a passage that is concluded by another instance of the formula, used, as usual, to signal a change of scene engineered by Athena (<em>Odyssey</em> 23.344; this is an instance of “ring composition”). The lines thus enclosed describe the long-awaited reunion of Penelope and Odysseus, and include the verse that Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus, according to the scholia, designated as the τέλος (the “end” or “fulfillment”—the meaning of this remark is much debated) of the <em>Odyssey</em> (see 23.296). The passage also includes the recapitulation of prior events by both Penelope and Odysseus. The integration of their respective stories (Penelope narrates what has happened on Ithaka in Odysseus’ absence, while Odysseus relates the tale of his wanderings) not only figures the reunion of the lovers; it also reconstitutes in a straightforward, linear fashion the <em>fabula</em> of the <em>Odyssey</em>, which has been presented by the poem’s master narrator in a self-consciously disjointed manner (compare de Jong 2001:563). The bracketing of these signal acts of narration by references to Athena’s agency underscores the goddess’s role as “source and sponsor of the plot” (quotation from Murnaghan 2005:61): it is Athena who makes possible the recapitulation of the plot on this occasion, just as it is she who sets in motion and directs events throughout the poem.

<p>At O.23.264–284, Odysseus retells to Penelope the prophecy of Teiresias about the odyssey that still awaits the hero after he has re-established himself as husband of Penelope and as king of Ithaca. The retelling here does not add to what was said already at O.11.119–137, on which I refer to the comment at those lines. But there is one big exception, centering on a most interesting detail: in his quest to travel as far inland as possible, until the oar that he carries on his shoulder is mistaken for a winnowing shovel, the wording of Odysseys has it that he will be passing through many <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ of humankind, Ο.23.267–268. The word <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ here recalls the same word as used in O.01.003, with reference to the journeys of Odysseus in the <em>Odyssey</em>: there too, it is said, the hero will be passing through many <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ of many different kinds of people. The question is, do those <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ belong to the <em>Odyssey</em> or to an odyssey beyond the <em>Odyssey</em>?  </p>

# Odyssey 24

<p>Before the <em>Odyssey</em> comes to an end, the Singer of Tales reaches back to what seems to be the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>. It is as if the second epic, the <em>Odyssey</em>, could now restart before it ends by reaching back into the first epic, the <em>Iliad</em>. Still, there will be no restart here. The plot of that first epic had started with a grand feud between Achilles and Agamemnon, but the plot of the second epic will now come to an end with a resolution of that feud. The feuding is over, so that the two main characters of the <em>Iliad</em> can now take time to review not only what happened in the <em>Iliad</em> but also, beyond the <em>Iliad</em>, how the two of them died, each his own way. Since they are now dead, they have to speak ghost to ghost, but that is not enough for Agamemnon. He must also speak with the new ghosts, the suitors, who will now give him a retrospective on the <em>Odyssey</em>. This way, Agamemnon can compare the story of his own life with the stories of both Odysseus and Achilles. And the comparison must be most depressing for him. But the Odyssey does not end with the sad thoughts of Agamemnon. Odysseus still has to reconnect with his own ancestors, and so there needs to be a final recognition scene between the son and his father Laertes. But even after this reconnection of the generations is finally achieved, the story is still not done. The feuding that has been triggered by the killing of the suitors must end; otherwise, the story cannot end.</p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/T11219_10_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Mercury Conducting the Souls of the Suitors to the Infernal Regions” (1805).

# Odyssey 24.1-14

<p>The god Hermes conducts the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors from the world of light and life into a world of darkness and death. Another way to think of these two distinct worlds is picture consciousness on one side and unconsciousness on the other side. Situated between these two worlds here are five mythological landmarks: the cosmic river Ōkeanos, O.24.011; the White Rock (<em>leukas petrā</em>), O.24.011; the Gates (<em>pulai</em>) of Hēlios the Sun, O.24.012; the District (<em>dēmos</em>) of Dreams (<em>oneiroi</em>), O.24.012, and, finally, the Meadow (<em>leimōn</em>) of Asphodel (the flower <em>asphodelos</em>). In other Homeric contexts, it would be sufficient for only one of these five landmarks, the Ōkeanos, to figure as a separator of light and life from darkness and death, of consciousness from unconsciousness. See especially the comments at O.10.508–512 O.11.012–019, O.11.020–022, O.12.001–004. In the present context, four other separators are listed, each one of which can be considered a multiform that has the same kind of built-in function of referring to a separator and a meeting-point between two opposite worlds. In Homeric poetry, there is no other attestation of the White Rock or of the District of Dreams, although other poetry shows traces of such landmarks (as in Alcman PMG 1.45–49; comments at GMP 224). But Homeric poetry does refer elsewhere to the Gates of the Sun: see the comments at I.05.395–404, I.05.646, I.11.671–761, I.23.071–076, O.04.809; see also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on the Gates of Hādēs and the anchor comment at I.23.071–076 on what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos really wants for itself—and for Achilles (Points 5 and 6 and 9). As for the Meadow of Asphodel, see the comment at O.24.014–023.  </p>

# Odyssey 24.014-023

<p>As the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors are being conducted by the god Hermes toward their ultimate otherworldly destination, which is unspecified, they come to a place called the Meadow of Asphodel, O.24.013, which is an abode for <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ described here as <em>eidōla</em> ‘images’ of the dead, O.24.014. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, I.23.072 and O.11.476, this same description applies to disembodied spirits of the dead who populate a mystical place that resembles what is known in other contexts as Hādēs. But the Meadow of Asphodel is not exactly Hādēs. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, this Meadow is where the spirit of Achilles himself abides, O.11.539. Also, at O.11.573, the Meadow of Asphodel is pictured as a “happy hunting ground”—to borrow an image from the Great Plains tribes of native Americans—where the great hunter Orion can hunt for all time to his heart’s content, O.11.572–575. In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em>, verses 221 and 344, the same Meadow of Asphodel becomes a pathway for the Cattle of the Sun after Hermes steals this solar herd from Apollo. And now, as we see here at O.O.24.013 just as we saw earlier at O.11.539, the Meadow of Asphodel is once again featured as the place where the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles is to be found: here he is, in the company of other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’, who are listed in the following order: Patroklos, Antilokhos, Ajax, O.24.015–018. In this same context, Ajax is described as the second-best of the Achaeans, after Achilles, O.24.017–018. This company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ is now joined by the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon, who is coming from some other direction, at the head of another company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’—those who had been killed together with Agamemnon by Aigisthos after they had made their way back home from Troy, O.24.021–022. At this point, we might have expected the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon to address the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors, asking them directly: how did <em>you</em> all die? And then I will tell you how we died. But such a dialogue is postponed till O.24.099–105. Instead, here at O.24.023, it is Achilles himself—or, let us say, it is his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’—who initiates a dialogue with the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon. You would think that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles had only now for the first time encountered the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon since he died. But, as we will see at O.24.024–034, Achilles already knows what happened to Agamemnon and to his followers after they had made their way back home from Troy: they died an ignominious death, through the treachery of Aigisthos. Conversely, as we will see at O.24.036–097, Agamemnon already knows what happened to Achilles: he never went home because he died at Troy, but his glorious death there earned him the greatest honors.  </p>

<p>Although the gender of <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ in referring here to the spirits of Achilles and Agamemnon is feminine, O.24.023 and O.24.035, the pronouns referring to the two dead heroes in the narrative that frames their dialogue continue to show the masculine gender, and the use of the feminine gender is discontinued altogether in the wording of the actual I-you dialogue: instead, as Achilles and Agamemnon proceed to speak to each other at O.24.024–034 and at O.24.036–097 respectively, they revert in their I-you dialogue to the masculine gender that they once had owned as speakers in Homeric narrative. The dialogue between the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit of Achilles and the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon frames a retrospective retelling of stories, taken separately, about what the two heroes had achieved at Troy—after all is said and done. In the case of Agamemnon, the retelling centers on his ultimate failure as a character in his own story. In the case of Achilles, on the other hand, the retelling centers on his ultimate success—despite his death. The verses at O.24.024–034 are spoken by the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles, O.24.023, who is addressing the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon: too bad, Achilles says without gloating, that things did not work out well for you. Then the verses at O.24.036–097 are spoken by the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon, O.24.035, who in turn addresses the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles: without attempting to detract from the glory in store for Achilles, Agamemnon retells, in second-person narrative, the death and funeral and entombment of Achilles. <em>You were killed; we arranged for your funeral and for funeral games in your honor; and then we made a tomb for you</em>.  </p>

<p>In these verses spoken by the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit of Achilles to the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon, O.24.024–034, the outcome of the story about Agamemnon is a foil for the outcome of the subsequent story about Achilles. Whereas Achilles will get glory for dying on the battlefield at Troy, away from home, Agamemnon gets no glory for his ignominious death back home: see the note at O.24.030–034. What gives the story of Achilles a “happy ending,” as we will see in the commentary ahead, is the glory that he gets not only from his death on the battlefield but also from his funeral and his entombment in the environs of Troy.

<p>In the words of Achilles here at O.24.0230–034, Agamemnon would have been better off if he too, like Achilles, had been killed at Troy: then the Achaeans would have made a tomb for him there, just as they had earlier made a tomb for Achilles. See the note at O.24.024–034. This way, as we read at O.24.033, Agamemnon would have achieved a future <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of song for himself and also for his son. The reference here to the son of Agamemnon, who would be Orestes, may be relevant to myths concerning the involvement of Agamemnon’s descendants in the region of Troy: for example, the island of Lesbos was reportedly settled by a hero named Penthilos, who was son of Orestes (Pausanias 2.18.5–6, Aristotle <em>Politics</em> 5.1311b27; see further at PH 155).  </p>

# Odyssey 24.036-24.097

<p>(What follows is an epitome of the comments in Nagy 2012:49–51.) The narrative here at O.24.036–097 is pervaded by references to the hero cult of Achilles. I offer here a brief inventory of some of these references:</p><p>—O.24.036, ὄλβιε Πηλέος υἱέ, θεοῖσ’ ἐπιείκελ’ Ἀχιλλεῦ ‘O you <em>olbios</em> son of Peleus, godlike Achilles’. So, Agamemnon here addresses Achilles as <em>olbios</em>, which would mean ‘fortunate’ on the surface. Beneath the surface, however, <em>olbios</em> here can be interpreted as ‘blessed’, referring to the sacred status of a cult hero: see the comment at O.19.107–114, with special reference to uses of <em>olbios</em> in the sense of ‘blessed’, as at verse 172 of the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em>.</p><p>—O.037–039, ἀμφὶ δέ σ’ ἄλλοι | κτείνοντο Τρώων καὶ Ἀχαιῶν υἷες ἄριστοι | μαρνάμενοι περὶ σεῖο ‘On all sides of you [= your corpse], the rest of them | were being slaughtered, sons of both Trojans and Achaeans, the best, | as they were fighting over you [= your corpse]’. The Achaeans and the Trojans are battling here over the possession of the corpse of Achilles. The mentality of needing to possess the body of the dead hero, whether he was a friend or an enemy in life, is typical of hero cults, in that the corpse of the cult hero was viewed as a talisman of fertility and prosperity for the community that gained possession of the hero’s body. Details in PH 32, 178; also Nagy 2006 §97.</p><p>—O.24.039–40, σὺ δ’ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης | κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί ‘There you were, lying in a swirl of dust. | You lay there so huge in all your hugeness’. The corpse of Achilles is described here as larger than life. This wording applies to Achilles also at I.18.026–027, where he stages himself as a corpse in mourning the death of Patroklos and where he is mourned by Thetis as if he were already a corpse: see the comment at I.018.070–071 (see also BA 113, especially with reference to I.18.071). At I.16.775–776, cognate wording applies to the corpse of the hero Kebriones. The corpse of Achilles is described as nine cubits long in the <em>Alexandra</em> of Lycophron (860). As we see from lore preserved in the historical period about cult heroes, they were conventionally pictured as far larger in death than they had been in life. Among the most striking examples is the corpse of Orestes as cult hero, described in Herodotus 1.68.</p><p>—O.24.059, περὶ δ’ ἄμβροτα εἵματα ἕσσαν ‘They [= the Nereids] dressed you [= your corpse] in immortalizing clothes’. At the funeral of Achilles, his divine mother and her sister Nereids dress the hero’s corpse in ‘immortalizing’ clothes. On the vital importance of understanding <em>ambrotos</em> as ‘immortalizing’ as well as ‘immortal’, see the comments at I.16.670 and I.16.680; details in GMP 141.</p><p>—O.24.073–077. After the cremation of the corpse of Achilles, his bones and those of the already cremated corpse of Patroklos are placed into a golden jar that had been given by the god Dionysus to the goddess Thetis. This jar, as we know from the comparative evidence of other poetic references (especially Stesichorus PMG 234), is a sign of the hero’s immortalization after death. See BA 209; also Dué 2001.</p><p>—O.24.085–086. After the making of the tumulus which will be the tomb shared by Achilles and Patroklos, O.24.080–084, funeral games are held in honor of Achilles. The details of this description match closely the details we can gather from historical evidence about athletic contests held in honor of cult heroes. Details in BA 116–117.</p><p>—O.24.091. The athletic contests at the funeral games of Achilles and the prizes to be won in these contests are instituted for the purpose of compensating for his death, and, in this verse, such an act of compensation is expressed by way of the prepositional phrase <em>epi soi</em> (ἐπὶ σοί), which can be translated roughly as ‘in your honor’. As we can see clearly from a variety of prose sources, the syntactical construct combining the preposition <em>epi</em> with the dative case of a given hero’s name refers to the cult of that hero. (Details in PH 121.) Perhaps the most striking example is this entry in the dictionary attributed to Hesychius: ‘<em>balletus</em>: a festival event at Athens, held in honor of Demophon son of Keleos’ (Βαλλητύς· ἑορτὴ Ἀθήνησιν, ἐπὶ Δημοφῶντι τῷ Κελεοῦ ἀγομένη).</p>

# Odyssey 24 48

<p>Here in <em>Odyssey</em> 24.46, the Achaeans cut their hair at the funeral of Achilles. This ritual gesture, GN argues, signals a symbolic transition from long-haired Achaeans to short-haired Greeks, corresponding to a transition from the heroic age to a post heroic-age. See H24H 14§26a. Commenting on the post-heroic era that follows the death of Achilles, the Ampelourgos says: οὐδὲ κομᾶν ἔτι μετὰ τὸν Ἀχιλλέα καλὸν ἡγούμενοι ‘no longer could they [= the Achaeans] consider it a beautiful thing to grow their hair long, once Achilles was gone’ (Philostratus <em>Hērōikos</em> 51.13). The wording connotes an aetiology, as if the death of Achilles were the single reason that explains why adult men of the post-heroic age no longer wore their hair long - except for such notable counter-examples as the Spartans. The wearing of long hair was a distinctive sign of pre-adult status. Even in the Iliad, the long hair of Achilles ostentatiously signals his pre-adult status, as we can see from the scene describing the funeral of Patroklos, where Achilles cuts off his long blond hair as he stands at the funeral pyre of his best friend (23.141). It is at this same place where the tumulus to be shared by Patroklos and Achilles will be built when the time comes for the funeral of Achilles himself (23.126). In this Homeric scene, as Achilles is standing on the heights of the promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his own body, he wistfully looks out over the seas of the outer Hellespont, fixing his gaze toward the far west, in the direction of his native land of Thessaly, and longing for the river Sperkheios that flows through that distant land: it was to the waters of that river, which he will never live to see again, that he had hoped to sacrifice his long hair after he came of age and was ready to cut it (23.142-153). But now Achilles cuts off his long hair prematurely and unseasonally as he stands there at the Asiatic promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his body (23.142). [See also GN HPC 166 = II§85.] And now the Achaean comrades of Achilles follow his example and likewise cut off their hair (23.135-136). So also in the wording that I have just highlighted from the <em>Hērōikos</em> of Philostratus, we see a reference to this ritual of coming of age: now that Achilles is dead, adult males of the future will be wearing their hair short, no longer long. It is as if all the ‘sons of the Achaeans’ were now ready to shift from pre-adult to adult status - now that Achilles is dead and buried. So, now, the <em>huies Akhaiōn</em>, ‘sons of the Achaeans’, as the Achaean warriors are regularly called in the Iliad (1.162 and so on) have reached a post-heroic maturity that inaugurates a post-heroic age.</p>

# Odyssey 24.058-24.061

<p>The goddess Thetis and her sister Nereids, as the family of Achilles, are lamenting Achilles: presumably, their singing can be described as <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, as I infer by comparing the use of this word in referring to the laments performed by Hector’s family at I.24.723 / I.24.747 (also at I.24.760) / I. 24.761. In the case of Hector’s funeral, there are also laments performed by non-family professionals, I.24.720–722: these professionals are <em>aoidoi</em> ‘singers’ who are men, I.24.720, and they perform <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721; as they perform, the word that refers to their performance is <em>thrēneîn</em> ‘make lament’, I.24.722, which is a verb derived from the noun <em>thrēnos</em> ‘lament’. So also here at O.24.61, we see the same verb <em>thrēneîn</em> ‘make lament’ applied to the singing of laments by the Muses themselves, who are in this context “professionals” by contrast with the Nereids, who are “family.” The lamenting of Achilles by the Muses is also described in Pindar <em>Isthmian</em> 8.56–60.  </p>

# Odyssey 24.76-84/ anchor comment on: tomb of Achilles, part 3

<p>What follows was originally posted in Classical Inquiries  2017.01.03.</p><p>Here is the original introduction to this anchor comment:</p><p>The Homeric <em>Iliad</em> as we have it refers at least two times directly and two times indirectly to the tomb of Achilles, while the <em>Odyssey</em> refers to it one time directly. In the direct references that we see in the <em>Iliad</em>, it is made clear that this tomb starts off as a small-scale structure, located at the same place where a funeral pyre is constructed for the cremation of the body of Patroklos, and that the original function of this tomb is to enclose the bones of that hero after his body is cremated. But it is also made clear, in both the direct and the indirect references as we see them in the <em>Iliad</em>, that this same tomb will in a future time enclose the bones of Achilles as well, which will then be mixed together with the bones of Patroklos inside a golden jar. In this future time, when Achilles too is dead, it will be his own body that will need to be cremated at the same place and then entombed in the same structure. For this new entombment to happen, however, the small-scale structure that had enveloped the bones of Patroklos will now grow into a large-scale structure, exponentially larger than the original. Such is the tomb of Achilles as pictured in <em>Odyssey</em> 24.  </p><p>The Introduction was then followed by five interconnected points:</p><p>Point 1. At I.23.125–126 and at I.23.245–248, we find two direct references to the tomb of Achilles, though at first it may seem as if the tomb belongs to Patroklos primarily and to Achilles only secondarily. See the anchor comments at I.23.125–126 and at I.23.245–248. Here at O.24.076–084, however, where we find the third and most detailed direct reference to the same tomb, it becomes clear that (A) this structure belongs primarily to Achilles and (B) the cremation and entombment of Patroklos were designed all along to prefigure the cremation and entombment of Achilles. Even in the <em>Iliad</em>, the two indirect references to the tomb show that Achilles is the primary occupant of the structure: see the comments on I.07.067–091 and on I.19.373–380.</p><p>Point 2. In the direct references that we find at I.23.125–126 and at I.23.245–248, it is made clear that this tomb starts off as a small-scale structure, located at the same place where a funeral pyre is constructed for cremating the body of Patroklos, and that the original function of this tomb is to enclose the bones of that hero after his body is cremated. But it is also made clear, not only in the direct references at I.23.125–126 and I.23.245–248 but also in the indirect references at I.07.067–091 and I.19.373–380, that this same tomb will in a future time enclose the bones of Achilles as well, which will then be mixed together with the bones of Patroklos inside a golden jar that had been given by the god Dionysus to the mother of Achilles, I.23.092. In this future time, when Achilles too is dead, it will be his own body that will need to be cremated at the same place and then entombed inside the same structure.</p><p>Point 3. Once the cremation of Achilles is completed, O.23.071, the bones of the hero are mixed with the bones of Patroklos and placed inside the golden jar, gift of Dionysus, that Thetis has now brought to the funeral, O.24.072–077. That golden jar signals a future of immortalization for Achilles and, by extension, for Patroklos, whose <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ had originally indicated the need for the bones of both heroes to be stored inside the golden jar, I.23.092 (BA 209–210). Now that the bones are safely stored in the golden jar, the two heroes must be entombed together. For this new entombment to happen, however, the small-scale structure that had enveloped the bones of Patroklos will now grow into a large-scale structure, exponentially larger than the original. As noted in the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257, the entombment of Achilles together with Patroklos will now lead to an upgrading of the tomb, the size of which will become spectacular in both height and width, I.23.246–247. And it is this large-scale structure, in all its splendor, that we see pictured in <em>Odyssey</em> 24.</p><p>Point 4. The structure is a <em>tumbos</em> ‘tomb’, O.24.080, which is ‘heaped up’ by the Achaean=Argive warriors to entomb the bones of Achilles and Patroklos, O.24.081: so the tomb is a tumulus. And this tumulus is situated on top of a high promontory that looks out over the sea of the Hellespont, O.24.082, so that it may shine from afar as a beacon light of salvation for all those who sail through the troubled waters of that dangerous sea—not only ‘now’ in the heroic past but also in the post-heroic future, O.24.083–084. The time frame indicated as ‘now’ here is the era of the heroes who fought in the Trojan War, but the future is of course the ever movable here-and-now of Homeric reception (Nagy 2012:48). Already at I.23.248, Achilles makes a pointed reference to the Achaeans of the future who will be sailing past the promontory on top of which his tomb is located and marveling at the sight of the structure, which is called a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ at I.23.257. See the anchor comment at I.23.245–248…256–257.</p><p>Point 5. By now we can picture the tomb of Achilles, situated on a promontory overlooking the dangerous sea of the Hellespont, as a magnificent structure resembling a splendid lighthouse. There is a comparable image to be seen at I.19.373–380: in these verses, which refer indirectly to the tomb of Achilles, the <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from the bright surface of the hero’s Shield, I.19.374, is compared to a <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ streaming from a fire that sends forth its light from a lighthouse, I.19.375. See the comment on I.19.373–380. As I note in the comment there, this saving light is described as holding forth a promise of salvation for sailors lost at sea who are longing to be reunited with their loved ones at home, I.19.375, I.19.377–378. And this light is said to be streaming from a fire that is burning at a remote place described here as a solitary <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ situated in the heights overlooking the dangerous seas below, I.19.376–377. To picture the tomb of Achilles as a <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’ that shelters herdsmen and that protects sailors is another traditional way of viewing the sacred place where the hero Achilles once lived and died. See the comments on I.18.587–589 and I.19.373–380.</p>

Thus the glory [<em>kleos</em>] will never perish for him, |197 the glory that comes from his merit [<em>aretē</em>], and a song will be created for earthbound humans |198 by the immortals—a song that brings beautiful and pleasurable recompense for sensible Penelope |199 —unlike the daughter of Tyndareos [= Clytemnestra], who masterminded evil deeds, |200 killing her properly-wedded [<em>kouridios</em>] husband, and a hateful subject of song |201 she will be throughout all humankind, and she will give a harsh reputation |202 to women, female [<em>thēluterai</em>] that they are—even for the kind of woman who does noble things.</p><p><u>Notes on the translation</u></p><p>In the original Greek wording, the prepositional phrase meaning ‘with great merit’ at O.24.193 cannot “modify” a noun, and so we cannot translate this wording as ‘you got to have a wife with great merit’, in the sense of ‘you got to have a wife who has great merit’; rather, the phrase modifies the verb ‘you got’. At O.24.197, I translate ‘his merit’, not ‘her merit’, interpreting this instance of <em>aretē</em> ‘merit’ at verse 197 as referring to the previous instance, at verse 193. At O.24.198, the epithet for <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ is <em>khariessa</em> ‘having <em>kharis</em>’, and I interpret the concept of <em>kharis</em> as ‘beautiful and pleasurable recompense’ in this context. On <em>kharis</em> as a word that conveys both beauty and pleasure, see <em>HC</em> 2§33. At O.24.202, <em>thēluterai</em> means not ‘more female’ but rather ‘female—as opposed to male’.</p><p>Further commentary at BA 36–38. </p><p>(What follows is an epitome of H24H 11§23, §§26–27.) The word <em>olbios</em> that we see being used here in the first verse seems at first ambivalent: we cannot be sure whether it means ‘fortunate’ or ‘blessed’. While a hero like Odysseus is still alive, it is dangerous for him to be described as <em>olbios</em> in the sense of ‘blessed’. A negative example of what can happen is the case of the hero Priam. Most telling are the words that Achilles addresses to him at I.24.543: ‘I hear that you, old man, were once upon a time <em>olbios</em>’ (καὶ σὲ γέρον τὸ πρὶν μὲν ἀκούομεν ὄλβιον εἶναι). When Achilles is saying this to Priam, the old man is experiencing the worst moments of his life. During those moments, he is neither fortunate nor blessed. Only after death could Priam ever become truly <em>olbios</em>. In the case of Odysseus, however, the <em>Odyssey</em> shows that this Homeric hero is ultimately not only fortunate but also blessed, and so the epithet <em>olbios</em> will in fact ultimately apply to him.</p><p>As we see here in O.24.192–202, Odysseus owes his successful homecoming to the faithfulness of his wife Penelope, who deserves only praise, O.24.193–198. And it is in this context of success that Agamemnon addresses Odysseus as <em>olbios</em>, ‘blessed’, O.24.192. By contrast, Agamemnon blames his own wife Clytemnestra for sabotaging his own ‘homecoming’ or <em>nostos</em>, O.24.096. Agamemnon contrasts his loss of ‘homecoming’ or <em>nostos</em> with the poetic ‘glory’ or <em>kleos</em> that Achilles will keep forever, O.24.094. But now, in O.24.192–202, we see that Agamemnon makes another basic contrast—between himself and Odysseus. What caused Agamemnon to lose his own <em>kleos</em>—and his own <em>nostos</em>—was the fact that his wife was Clytemnestra, who was unfaithful to him and who contrived his murder, O.24.199-202. By contrast, the faithfulness of Penelope to Odysseus helped that hero secure his own <em>kleos</em>, O.24.196, in the context of O.24.196–198. To add to the irony, Agamemnon’s words describe his violent death as <em>lugros</em>, ‘disastrous’, O.24.096, and his wife Clytemnestra as <em>oulomenē</em>, ‘disastrous’, O.24.097. Both of these epithets, as we have seen earlier, are words that evoke the poetry of epic: <em>lugros</em>, ‘disastrous’, is the epithet of both the <em>nostos</em> or ‘song about homecoming’ that Phemios sings in O.01.327 and of the <em>nostos</em> that Nestor narrates in O.03.132, while <em>oulomenē</em>, ‘disastrous’, is the epithet of the anger of Achilles in I.01.002.  </p>

# Odyssey 24.192-202

<p>  </p><p>These words of Agamemnon show that the likeminded couple, Penelope and Odysseus (cp. O.6.181-184), is worthy of <a class="comment-cross-ref" href="/tags/kleos">#kleos</a>, a glorious epic song – and what is more, this <em>kleos</em> is characterized by <a class="comment-cross-ref" href="/tags/kharis">#kharis</a>. His praise makes the source of <em>kleos</em> in the <em>Odyssey</em> explicit. It is the mind (<em>phrenes</em>, O.24.194) of Penelope and her remembering Odysseus (O.24.195) that is worthy of celebration. And it is, again, a <em>much contriving</em> Odysseus (O.24.192), his epithet pointing to his mental abilities, who has the luck of having Penelope as his wife. Although what exactly the <em>arēte</em>, ‘excellence’ (O.24.193, O.24.197), that both gives rise to this song and is its subject, is <em>in</em>, is left somewhat ambiguous, or even whether it is the <em>arēte</em> of Penelope or Odysseus – or, as I would like to take it, of the couple together – we can see that mental abilities are central to it, and throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>, the couple standing out for theirs are Penelope and Odysseus. </p><p>Further, Agamemnon’s words show the connection between the worthy achievements and their commemoration in song very clearly. Agamemnon speaks specifically of songs and reputation conveyed through them, contrasting Penelope with Klytaimestra. The balance of the comparison of the two women creates an effect of symmetrical opposition. As Penelope is called <em>κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου</em>, “daughter of Ikarios” (O.24.195), so Klytaimestra is <em>Τυνδαρέου κούρη</em>, “daughter of Tyndareos” (O.24.199), both named through their fathers, but with the word order reversed as if to draw out the contrast between them. While Penelope <em>εὖ μέμνητ’ Ὀδυσῆος, / ἀνδρὸς κουριδίου</em>, “well remembered Odysseus, her wedded husband” (O.24.195-196), Klytaimestra <em>κακὰ μήσατο ἔργα, / κουρίδιον κτείνασα πόσιν</em>, “devised her evil deeds, killing her wedded husband” (O.24.199-200). In both cases, the object of the wife’s action is her respective husband, both times qualified by “wedded” (there is perhaps even a suggestion of further parallelism in the alliterative echoing in <em>memnēt’</em>, ‘remembered’, and <em>mēsato</em>, ‘devised’). As Penelope occasions <em>κλέος</em>, “song of glory,” and <em>ἀοιδὴν / […] χαρίεσσαν</em>, “<em>kharis</em>-filled song,” to delight mortals (O.24.196-198), so Klytaimestra gives rise to <em>στυγερὴ […] ἀοιδὴ</em>, “hateful song,” among humans (O.24.200-201), the words and phrases mirroring one another again. The parallelism and even repetitions of specific words and phrases concretely demonstrates the opposition between the two kinds of song, the praise poetry of epic on one hand, and the blame poetry on the other. </p><p>Finally, <em>khalepe</em>, ‘grievous’, ‘harsh’, ‘hard to bear’, that qualifies the repute Klytaimestra gives women is the same word as we have seen in Mentor’s speech qualifying the harsh (<em>khalepos</em>, O.2.232) king that he takes the Ithacans to deserve for not remembering Odysseus. Therefore, in the polarities between good, ethical conduct and memory on the one hand and bad behavior and incurrence of <em>mēnis</em> on the other, Klytaimestra’s song would fall on the side of the latter, leading to grief and pain. If we compare this picture with that presented by Odysseus in his wishes for a happy marriage to Nausikaa, we can see that this pain aligns with the <em>algea</em>, ‘griefs’, suffered by the enemies of the ideal likeminded couple (O.6.184). In contrast, the good person’s praise poetry in Agamemnon’s exclamation is characterized by <em>kharis</em>: the <em>kleos</em> is an <em>aoidē khariessa</em>, a ‘<em>kharis</em>-filled song’ (O.24.197-198), just as the likemindedness of the couple in Odysseus’ wishes for Nausikaa is the cause of <em>kharmata</em>, ‘source of joy’ (O.24.185), for their well-wishers. And here we have one such well-wisher, Agamemnon, exclaiming on the happiness of Odysseus and Penelope, and even calling their <em>kleos</em> <em>kharis</em>-filled himself. </p><p>See further: </p><p>Nagy, Gregory. 1974. <em>Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter</em>.

# Odyssey 24.281-286

<p>  </p><p>In this passage, Laertes provides us with more insights on the proper kind of relationship of <em>kharis</em>, of reciprocal exchange of good turns. Most importantly, he specifies what is <em>themis</em>, right in accordance with the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior, in relationships of <em>kharis</em>: the ample reciprocal exchange of gifts and hospitality (O.24.285). Both of the key terms for reciprocity, in the form of words connected to <em>kharis</em> (<em>χαρίζεο</em>, “gave freely,” O.24.283) and <em>amoibe</em> (<em>ἀμειψάμενος</em>, “having requited,” O.24.285), are present. In addition, the way the <em>themis</em> of relationships of <em>kharis</em> is phrased, with <em>ὅς τις ὑπάρξῃ</em>, “when one has begun,” (O.24.286), implies that the relationship is continuous, with a potentially infinite number or reciprocations. This confirmation the ongoing nature of <em>kharis</em> also supports its connection to memory, which is necessary for sustaining this continuity. This is the kind of reciprocity, Laertes maintains, that Odysseus would have shown. </p><p>Laertes also characterizes the suitors (and by extension, especially given the impreciseness of his words, their solidarity group) as <em>ἀτάσθαλοι ἄνδρες</em>, “wicked men” (O.24.282). This adjective is applied to their behavior elsewhere in the poem, too, and it is the opposite of Odysseus’ conduct according to Penelope (O.4.693). Laertes also characterizes the suitors as <em>ὑβρισταὶ</em>, “men of <em>hubris</em>,” making explicit their status as violators of the rules maintaining the cosmic order (cp. O.24.458 on <em>atasthalia</em>; O.1.368, O.3.206-207, O.4.321, O.4.625-627, O.16.85-86, O.16.410, O.15.328-329 on <em>hubris</em>). The contrast drawn here between the suitors and Odysseus implies that what qualifies the suitors as men of <em>hubris</em> is their failure in matters of <em>kharis</em> in accordance with <em>themis</em>. What Laertes says of the suitors matches what we see in Penelope’s speech at O.4.687-695 (where see my comment). </p>

# Odyssey 24.482-486

<p>Zeus’ speech here offers a solution to what may appear to be the beginning of a continuous cycle of violence and one of the tensions set up early in the poem. The speech recalls that of Telemakhos’ to the assembly, which forecast the threat of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors and Ithacans (<em>Od</em>. 2.63-69). Instead of the extension of the retributive power of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors’ solidarity group, however, Zeus here proposes to cancel it with the help of divinely inspired total forgetting of the suitors and their killing (ἔκλησιν, <em>Od</em>. 24.485). We can see that <em>lēthē</em> is opposed not only to memory, but also to its flipside <em>mēnis</em>. Furthermore, by comparing Zeus’ speech with that of Mentor’s in the assembly, another way in which it resolves the tensions set up in the poem becomes apparent: just as Mentor says that the Ithacans deserve a harsh ruler for not remembering how kind a ruler Odysseus was (<em>Od</em>. 2.230-234), here Zeus promises that Odysseus will in fact continue to rule, and there will be love between him and his subjects. This outcome, too, depends on the <em>eklēsis</em>, and so we can see that the ills resulting from <em>mēnis</em> and not remembering are both countered by this divine forgetting, further underlining their parallelism.</p>

# Odyssey 1.1

<p>Odysseus is the only epic personage to share with Hermes the epithet <em>polutropos</em> (Homeric Hymn 4.13). Similarly, in Homeric Hymn 28.2, the second hymn to Athena , she has the epithet <em>polumētis</em> &#x27;cunning in many ways&#x27;, which is otherwise restricted to Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em> (I.03.216) and the <em>Odyssey</em> (O.04.763, O.20.168, 22.1).  By no coincidence, these are the two divinities who preside over the return of Odysseus as planned by Athena and Zeus in this narrative. See also <em>Odyssey</em> 1.98 and comments on it below. Note also the only other occurrence of <em>polutropos</em> in Homer (O.10.330), when Kirke figures out who he is because he does not take on the appearance of a pig  and go to the sty when struck by her <em>rhabdos &#x27;staff, wand&#x27;. </em>She<em> </em>explains in the next line (O.10.331) that Hermes (identified only via his epithets, not his name, as though to raise awareness of such terms and who owns them) continually warned her about Odysseus&#x27;s arrival.</p>

As for Odysseus, |81 he headed for the renowned palace of Alkinoos.</p><p>[The comments that follow are epitomized from Nagy 2015.09.10§§6–9.] At O.07.078, we see the name <em>Athḗnē</em> for the goddess Athena. At O.07.080 we see the same name <em>Athēnē</em> for the place that is known in historical times as the city of Athens. As a place-name, <em>Athḗnē</em> is attested only here in the singular. Everywhere else, in the entire surviving textual evidence of the Greek language, this place-name is attested only in the plural, <em>Athênai</em>. The plural has an elliptic function, but I think that even the suffix -<em>ḗnē</em> of <em>Athḗnē</em> is elliptic. Here is a working definition of ellipsis: a form that is <em>elliptic</em> refers not only to X but also to everything that belongs to X, such as X2, X3, X4 etc. An elliptic form of X implies X2, X3, X4 etc. without naming X2, X3, X4 etc. explicitly. In terms of this definition, the name <em>Athḗnē</em> refers not only to the goddess ‘Athena’ but also to everything that belongs to the goddess. An example of such ‘everything’ would be the acropolis of Athens. And we see a further level of ellipsis in the plural form <em>Athênai</em>: this elliptic plural refers not only to the acropolis of Athens but also to everything that belongs to the acropolis, and that everything becomes the city of Athens. Eventually, the ellipsis extends to everything that belongs to the city, which is ultimately the region of Attica. Earlier, however, in the second millennium BCE, the extended region of Attica was not yet dominated by Athens. And a rival dominant power in Attica was Marathon, mentioned here at O.07.80 as an alternative residence of the goddess Athena. But even if Athena had alternative residences in Attica, only in one place did she have a condominium, as it were, with Erekhtheus, and that place was the acropolis of Athens. On the relationship of the goddess Athena with the hero Erekhtheus, see the comment on I.02.546–552. Comparable to the name <em>Athḗnē</em> is the name of the nymph or local goddess <em>Mukḗnē</em>, who presides over the acropolis of Mycenae. As for the elliptic plural <em>Mukênai</em>, it must refer not only to the acropolis but also to the region dominated by the acropolis. Another comparable form is the place-name <em>Messḗnē</em>, which means something like ‘Midland’. Here I compare the place-name me-za-na written on a Linear B tablet from Pylos, Cn 3.1. And here is another relevant piece of information from the Linear B texts: in a tablet from Knossos, V 52, the name of a female divinity in line one is a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja, which I interpret as <em>athānās potniāi</em> ‘to the lady [<em>potnia</em>] of Athens’. I translate <em>athānā</em> here as ‘Athens’, by which I mean simply the acropolis of Athens as it existed as far back as the second millennium BCE. [Further analysis in Nagy 2015.07.10.] </p>

tags: Ares and Athena as divinities of war, A Sampling of Comments on the Odyssey

# Odyssey 14.216

<p>(What follows is epitomized from HPC 289–290, where I offer supplementary bibliography.) A comparable pairing of Ares and Athena as divinities of war is found at I.18.515–519. See the comments on those lines. As I noted already in those comments, such a pairing of Ares and Athena is so old as to be traceable all the way back to the Bronze Age. Here I offer some details. As we know from the documentary evidence of the Linear B tablets found in the palace of Knossos in Crete, the divinities Athena and Ares (in that order) are paired as symmetrical recipients of offerings: in one tablet, V 52, a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja is listed together with e-nu-wa-ri-jo and pa-ja-wo-ne and po-se-da-o-ne. I interpret these syllabic spellings as follows: a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja = <em>Athānāi potniāi</em> or perhaps <em>Athānās potniā </em>(see the comment on O.07.078–081), e-nu-wa-ri-jo = <em>Enūaliōi</em>, pa-ja-wo-ne = <em>Paiāwonei</em>, po-se-da-o-ne = <em>Poseidāonei</em>. As we know from the evidence of Homeric diction, the divine name <em>Enūalios</em> became an epithet of Ares, as we see for example at I.18.211. In some Homeric contexts, as at I.20.069, <em>Enūalios</em> is a god in his own right, distinct from Ares, just as <em>Paiāwōn</em> (Homeric <em>Paiēōn</em>) is in some contexts distinct from Apollo, as at I.05.401, I.05.899–900. As for the name of Ares, it too is attested in the Linear B tablets, Knossos Fp 14 and Fp 5816, in the form a-re = <em>Arei</em>. The Cretan connection of Athena and Ares is attested here at O.14.216 as well, where Odysseus in the second of his “Cretan lies” represents himself as a Cretan prince who professes his devotion to these two divinities in moments of crisis in battle. I should add that the pairing of Ares and Athena in the world of images represented on the Shield of Achilles is expressed by way of bronzework that is overlaid with gold, I.18.517–519. Such a technique of metalwork, as narrated on the Shield, is notionally linked to the heroic age or, as archaeologists would say it, to the Bronze Age.</p>

# Odyssey 16.397

<p>This phrase about the good mental abilities of a character is here used of Amphinomos, the suitor who appears to be the least rotten of the lot. His better qualities are further brought out in this passage by mentioning that he pleases Penelope the most with words (<em>μύθοισι</em>; O.16.397-398) and that he thinks well (<em>ἐῢ φρονέων</em>, O.16.399), in both cases vocabulary we can see elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>to connect with a good mind and memory. The same formulaic phrase <em>φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ&#x27; ἀγαθῇσιν</em>, “for he had good <em>phrenes</em>,” is used of Eumaios and his unforgetful, unfailing observance of the gods (O.14.420-421): the formula indicates the connection between good memory, good <em>phrenes</em>, and respect of the cosmic order. Sharing this formulaic description with Odysseus’ exemplarily upright swineherd, Amphinomos appears to be of this more mindful sort, too. This characterisation is furthermore supported by Amphinomos’ deference to the gods’ will (O.16.402-403). Elsewhere, his exceptionality among the suitors is brought out in his treatment of Odysseus disguised as a beggar (O.18.122-123): he is deferential and kind when all others insult Odysseus.</p>

# Odyssey 22.005

<p>As noted in the comment at O.22.001–125, Odysseus passes three tests in proving that he is the lawful husband of Penelope and the genuine king of Ithaca: (1) the stringing of the bow, (2) the contest in archery, and (3) the killing of the suitors. Here at O.22.005, we see that the Greek word referring to the second test, the contest in archery, is <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) ‘ordeal’. Now that he has performed his winning shot, Odysseus is saying that the contest has ‘reached an outcome’, as expressed by the verb <em>ek-teleîn</em>, O.22.005. On the use of this word <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) ‘ordeal’ with reference to the heroic Labors of Hēraklēs, see the comment at O.11.620–624. On the use of this same word with reference to the ‘ordeals’ of warfare, see the comments at I.03.125–128; also at O.03.262 and O.04.170. On its use with reference to contests in athletics, see the comment at O.08.096–103. The masculine noun <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>), in referring to the ritualized ‘ordeal’ of <em>āthlētai</em> ‘athletes’, is correlated with the neuter noun <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>), which refers to a ‘prize’ that is won in competition among athletes.</p>

Singling out likemindedness as the greatest good for the couple accords also with the Hesiodic representation of the fifth age of men, where the lack of likemindedness is the most prominent sign of the failures of this age (<em>Works and Days</em> 182-184).</p>

# Odyssey 18.125-128

<p>In this speech by Odysseus, words indicating good mental abilities, <em>pepnumenos</em>, ‘being in full possession of one’s senses’, ‘wise’ and <em>epētēs</em>, ‘courteous’, ‘gentle’, or, as Annette Dale argues, ‘very proficient in speech,’ are applied to Amphinomos, the noblest among the suitors. The first of these, <em>pepnumenos</em>, is often applied to Telemakhos to indicate his good sense (e.g. O.1.367, O.2.208, O.4.593), whereas <em>epētēs</em> is used in conjunction with adjectives pointing to good sense: <em>angkhinoos</em>, ‘ready of wit’, ‘shrewd’, and <em>ekhephrōn</em>, ‘sensible’, literally, ‘having <em>phrenes</em>’ – and all three are applied to Odysseus, a prime example of possessing a good mind (O.13.322, the only other occurrence of <em>epētēs</em> in Homer). Furthermore, <em>epētēs</em>, especially in the sense ‘very proficient in speech,’ ties in with Amphinomos’ description at O.16.397-398: that he is most pleasing to Penelope when it comes to speech (see also my comment at O.16.397). </p><p>In another passage illustrating Amphinomos’ positive difference from the rest of the suitors, he seconds Telemakhos’ reproach of the suitors’ riotousness at supper and suggestion it is time they go home (O.18.414-421). Amphinomos maintains that Telemakhos is right and proposes a libation before they head home - and here too, his ability at speaking plays a part: what he says is to all <em>ἑαδότα μῦθον</em>, “a pleasing speech” (O.18.422). His good sense not only leads to sensible speech, but his speech is effective, he can persuade his listeners: the suitors leave. So even in one of the suitors – the noblest one – we are shown the connection between good sense and speaking well, and that the first needed for the second.</p><p></p><p>See further:</p><p>Dale, Annette Teffeteller. 1982. “Homeric ἐπητής/ἐπητύς: Meaning and Etymology.” <em>Glotta </em>60:205-214.</p><p>Russo, Joseph, Manuel Fernández-Galiano, and Alfred Heubeck. 1992. <em>A Commentary on Homer’s </em>Odyssey, vol.
