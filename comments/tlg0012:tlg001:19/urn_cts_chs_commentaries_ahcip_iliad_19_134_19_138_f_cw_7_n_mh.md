<p>Having finished at I.19.134 with the retelling of the epic narrative about Hēraklēs, Agamemnon now comes back to his admission that it was <em>atē</em> for him to dishonor Achilles, I.19.136. This word, as we have seen, can be translated as ‘aberration’ or ‘derangement’ or even simply ‘mistake’. In the present context, the noun <em>atē</em> is paired twice with the verb <em>aâsthai</em>, at both I.19.136 and I.19.137, and I translate this verb here simply as ‘make a mistake’. Agamemnon then declares his readiness to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.19.138. This gesture brings us back to I.09.115, where Agamemnon had already admitted his <em>atai</em> ‘aberrations’ in dishonoring Achilles, adding at I.09.120 that he was ready to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’ for these aberrations. See the comment on I.09.115–120. </p>
