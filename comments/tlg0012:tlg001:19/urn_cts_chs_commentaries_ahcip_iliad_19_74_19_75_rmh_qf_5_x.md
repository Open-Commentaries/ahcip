<p>The <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles has now finally been ‘un-said’ by the hero, as expressed by the verb <em>apo-eipeîn</em>, I.19.075. The response of the Achaeans as an aggregate is a collective feeling of joy, as expressed by the root <em>khar</em>- of the verb <em>khairein</em> in the sense of ‘rejoice’. By contrast, while the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ was still ongoing, the Achaeans had collectively felt grief, as expressed by the root <em>akh</em>- of the verb <em>akhnusthai</em> ‘feel grief’ and of the noun <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’. See especially the comments on I.01.188 and on I.01.509. Such a semantic contrast between collective joy and collective grief is re-enacted in names like <em>Khari-lā(u̯)os</em> and <em>*Akhi-lāu̯os</em>. The second of these two names is my reconstruction of an older form of the name <em>Akhil(l)leús</em>: see the comment on I.01.002. (BA 77, 79; also 65).  </p>
