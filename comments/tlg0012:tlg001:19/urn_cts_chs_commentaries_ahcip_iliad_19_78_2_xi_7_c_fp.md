<p>Agamemnon addresses his fellow warriors here as <em>therapontes</em> (plural) of Ares. In contexts where the plural <em>therapontes</em> in combination with <em>Arēos</em> ‘of Ares’ is applied to the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives as a grouping of warriors, the deeper meaning is more evident than in other contexts.  </p>
