<p>Agamemnon in claiming that it was not he but rather Zeus together with his divine apparatus that can be held <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’ for the mistake that resulted in what is narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>. Zeus is well aware of such claims, as we will see when we read the comment on O.01.32–34.  </p>
