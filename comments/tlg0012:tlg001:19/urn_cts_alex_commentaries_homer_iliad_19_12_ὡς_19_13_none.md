<p>This scene is depectied on an Athenian black-figure vase dating to the mid 6th century, now at the Louvre (E869, BAPD 310146). Achilles receives a wreath and a shield from Thetis. Both are labeled. To his right stands Odysseys, facing away. His name is spelled ΟΛΥΤΕΥΣ as is usual in non-litterary Attic.</p><p></p><p>Brommer, Frank. “Zur Schreibweise des Namens Odysseus.” <em>Zeitschrift Für Vergleichende Sprachforschung</em>, vol. 96, no. 1, 1982, pp. 88–92.</p>
