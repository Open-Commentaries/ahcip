<p>The word <em>atē</em>, which I translate as ‘aberration’ or ‘derangement’ or even ‘mistake’ in the general comment on I.19.076–138, is both a passive experience, as described here by Agamemnon, and an active force that is personified as the goddess <em>Atē</em>, as we see later, starting at verse 91. See again the general comment on I.19.076–138.</p>
