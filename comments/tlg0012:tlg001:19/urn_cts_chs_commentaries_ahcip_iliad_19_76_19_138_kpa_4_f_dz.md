<p>In seeking to settle his quarrel with Achilles, Agamemnon claims that he was not <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’, I.19.086. Rather it was <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ or ‘derangement’ that that made him ‘act deranged’, <em>aâsthai</em>, I.19.091. This word <em>aâsthai</em>, which can be translated more literally as ‘veer off-course’, functions here as the verb for the noun <em>atē</em>, which can be translated correspondingly as ‘veering off-course’. In what follows, I can even translate the noun <em>atē</em> simply as ‘mistake’ and the verb <em>aâsthai</em> as ‘making a mistake’. In the verses that are being covered in this general comment, here are the occurrences of <em>aâsthai</em> in the sense of ‘make a mistake’ and functioning as the verb that matches the noun <em>atē</em>: I.19.091, I.19.095, I.19.113, I.19.129, I.19.136, I.19.137. In juridical terms, <em>atē</em> can refer either to a mistake that you made or to the damages that you have to pay to remedy that mistake. The mistake is the cause of the damages, and the damages are the effect of the mistake. And, since <em>atē</em> can refer either to the cause or to the effect of the mistake, it can be personified as a malevolent goddess <em>Atē</em> who presides over the whole process of cause-and-effect. That is why Agamemnon can say that I am not <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’, but Zeus and his entire divine apparatus are responsible, since they inflicted on me the goddess <em>Atē</em>. In effect, the goddess <em>Atē</em> made me do it. In the verses that are being covered in this general comment, here are the occurrences of <em>atē</em>/<em>Atē</em>: Ι.19.088, Ι.19.091, Ι.19.126, Ι.19.129, I.19.136. Agamemnon has more to say about the personified <em>Atē</em>: this goddess had once upon a time caused even Zeus himself to make a big mistake. That mistake resulted in the epic traditions about Hēraklēs, analyzed in the comment on I.19.95–133. But, happily for the gods, <em>Atē</em> no longer lives in Olympus: she was thrown out of there by Zeus for having caused him to make a mistake, and she landed on Earth, where she could now cause trouble only for us humans. We are the ones who make mistakes, while the Olympians no longer make mistakes—now that <em>Atē</em> cannot go back to Olympus. I see at work here a theological fact of life: in the age of myth, gods used to make mistakes, but not today in the age of ritual.</p>
