<p>The time has come for Achilles to re-enter the war against the Trojans. For this to happen, Agamemnon must first settle with Achilles. But the over-king feels the need to say more than simply to formulate his proposed terms of settlement. His aim is to excuse himself from responsibility for dishonoring Achilles, and the story that he tells in order to achieve this aim is a retelling of a cosmic <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that resulted in the Labors of Hēraklēs. Such a retelling, however, is destined to backfire: it will result in further damage to his own royal status and in further advancement for the heroic prestige of Achilles, for whom Hēraklēs now becomes a perfect model.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/156108001.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Herakles at the tree of the Hesperides, holding three of the golden apples in his left hand.
