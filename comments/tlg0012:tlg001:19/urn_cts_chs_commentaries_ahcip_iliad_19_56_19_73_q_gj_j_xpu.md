<p>In this speech of Achilles, he himself refers to his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ by way of the verb <em>apomēniein</em> at I.19.062 (ἀπομηνίσαντος). This anger has been the main theme of the <em>Iliad</em> ever since I.01.001, and Achilles now expresses regret over the many deaths that resulted for his Achaean companions. The speech of the hero here contains also other words that are relevant to <em>mēnis</em>: of special interest are <em>meneainein</em> ‘get angry’ at I.19.058 (μενεήναμεν) and <em>mimnēskein</em> ‘remind’ at I.19.064 (μνήσεσθαι). Both of these words convey a sense of mental reciprocity in the feelings of anger as experienced by both heroes. See the comments on I.01.207 and I.01.247. See also <em>The Best of the Achaeans</em>, 73 and 312. In the present speech, Achilles goes so far as to regret that he and Agamemnon quarreled over Briseis. If only she had died, he says at I.19.059–060, on the day when he captured her after he conquered the city of Lyrnessos. But Achilles stops short of saying that he regrets having conquered Lyrnessos.</p>
