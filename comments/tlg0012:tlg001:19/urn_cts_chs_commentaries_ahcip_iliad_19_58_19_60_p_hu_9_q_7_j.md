<p>In referring to Briseis here, the words of Achilles briefly retell the story about his conquest of Lyrnessos and his capture of Briseis. I refer here again to my three anchor comments about Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad</em>:</p><p>anchor comment on I.02.689–694<br />anchor comments on I.09.128–131 and I.09.270–272<br />anchor comment on I.11.624–627.</p>
