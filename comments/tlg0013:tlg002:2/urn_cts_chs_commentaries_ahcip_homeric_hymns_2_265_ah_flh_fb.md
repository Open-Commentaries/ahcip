<p>At the core of the narratives about <em>Hēraklēs</em> is the meaning of <em>hērōs</em>, ‘hero’, as a cognate of <em>Hērā</em>, the goddess of seasonality and equilibrium, and of <em>hōrā</em>, a noun that actually means ‘seasonality’ in the context of designating hero cult, as in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 265. The unseasonality of the <em>hērōs</em> in mortal life leads to the <em>telos</em> or ‘fulfillment’ of <em>hōrā</em>, ‘seasonality’, in immortal life, which is achieved in the setting of hero cult, as we will see in Hour 13§§11-22. Such a concept of <em>telos</em> as ‘fulfillment’ is also expressed by an adjectival derivative of <em>telos</em>, which is <em>teleia</em>, used as a cult epithet that conventionally describes the goddess <em>Hērā</em>. That is, <em>Hērā</em> is the goddess of <em>telos</em> in the sense of ‘fulfillment’.</p>
