<p>Such myths can be understood in terms of initiation from boyhood into manhood, for the purpose of preparing men for warfare. Such a ritualized purpose is evident also in such institutions as the seasonally recurring mock battle known as the <em>Ballētus</em> at the Eleusinian Games, which I considered in the Homeric <em>Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267. Another, more famous, example is the mock battle of Spartan boys in a sacralized space known as the <em>Platanistās</em>, ‘Grove of the Plane Trees’ (Pausanias 3.11.2, 3.14.8-9, at 3.20.8). On the basis of such rituals, we may infer that the institutionalized practices of athletics and warfare were originally viewed as parts of one single ritual continuum. </p>
