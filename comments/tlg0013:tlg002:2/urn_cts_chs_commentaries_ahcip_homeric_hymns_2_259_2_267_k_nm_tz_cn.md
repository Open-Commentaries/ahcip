<p>So, just as the Golden Generation is a positive image of a cult hero, the corresponding Silver Generation is a negative image. In this narrative about the Silver Generation (<em>Works and Days</em> 127-142), the Hesiodic <em>Works and Days</em> shows the dark side of cult heroes: the heroes of the Silver Generation refuse to ‘care for’ the gods, <em>therapeuein</em> (135), and they likewise refuse to perform sacrifices to the gods (136). But, despite such impious behavior, which is equated with not giving <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, to the gods (138), these heroes of the Silver Generation are said to receive <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, from humans after they die, just as the heroes of the Golden Generation receive honor (142). And, taken from the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (259-267), this word <em>tīmē</em> can refer to the ‘honor’ that cult heroes receive in the rituals of hero cult after they die, as in the case of the <em>tīmē</em> received by the cult hero Demophon after he dies (261, 263). As we can see in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (268), where the goddess refers to herself as <em>tīmāokhos</em>, ‘receiver of honor’ [<em>tīmē</em>], the gods receive tīmē just as cult heroes receive tīmē, but of course they do not have to die to receive it as heroes have to die. And the heroes of the Silver Generation do have to die, as we have just seen in the text I quoted. So, once again, I apply the formula: <strong>god-hero antagonism in myth corresponds to god-hero symbiosis in ritual</strong>.</p>
