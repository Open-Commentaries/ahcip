<p>The death of the infant hero will be compensated by seasonally recurring rituals of athletic re-enactment, as expressed by the word <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’ (verse 263), which refers here to the honor conferred upon cult heroes in the rituals of hero cult. In this case, the rituals take the form of an athletic competition that overtly simulates warfare. And these rituals will have to recur seasonally, year after year, for a notional eternity. Such a seasonal recurrence is indicated by the word <em>hōrā</em> at verse 265 of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>. And now we see why the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, that the prototypical hero receives in compensation for his death is described as <em>a-phthi-tos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (verse 263), that is, lasting forever. Another example of such a seasonally recurring ritual is a mock battle of boys competing within a sacralized space known as the <em>Platanistās</em>, ‘Grove of the Plane Trees’, in Sparta: this ritual is described by Pausanias (3.11.2, 3.14.8-9), who notes that the boys made sacrifice to the hero Achilles before they started their mock battle (3.20.8). </p>
