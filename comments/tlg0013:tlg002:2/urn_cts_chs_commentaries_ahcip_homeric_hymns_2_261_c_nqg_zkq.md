<p>In this comment I need to concentrate on the actual form of immortalization that Dēmophōn and Achilles will be granted by the divine order. In the case of Dēmophōn, as we see in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 261 and 263, he will be granted <em>tīmē aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’, by virtue of becoming the cult hero who presides over the prime athletic event of the Eleusinian Games; and, in the case of Achilles (<em>Iliad</em> 9.413), he will be granted <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’, by virtue of becoming the cult hero who presides over the prime poetic event of the Panathenaia. </p>
