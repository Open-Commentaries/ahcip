<p>Here we see the same syntactical construction that we saw in the compressed retelling of the aetiological myth that motivated the foundation of the athletic competition ‘in honor of’ the infant hero Dēmophōn. I repeat here the wording as we found it in Hesychius: Βαλλητύς· ἑορτὴ Ἀθήνησιν, ἐπὶ Δημοφῶντι τῷ Κελεοῦ ἀγομένη, ‘<em>Ballētus</em> is a festival in Athens, celebrated in honor of [<em>epi</em>] Dēmophōn son of Keleos’. Once again, I have translated the preposition <em>epi</em> (ἐπί) here in combination with the name of Dēmophōn in the dative case as ‘in honor of Dēmophōn’. But this translation is inadequate, and it would be more accurate to word it this way: ‘in compensation for [the death of] Dēmophōn’. After all, as I noted in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267, the athletic competition of the <em>Ballētus </em>is overtly described as an act of compensation, recurring at the right season into all eternity, and this competition is understood to be an eternal compensation for one single all-important fact: that the hero Dēmophōn must die. </p>
