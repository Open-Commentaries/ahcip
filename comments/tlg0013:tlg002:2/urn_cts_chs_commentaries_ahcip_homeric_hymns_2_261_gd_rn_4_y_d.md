<p>As I note in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> 259-267, the goddess Demeter foretells the <em>tīmē</em> <em>aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’ (verses 261, 263), of a seasonally-recurring athletic event that the hero Dēmophōn will receive as a compensation for his death (verses 265-267). Similarly in the <em>Iliad</em>, the goddess Thetis foretells the <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’ (9.413), that the hero Achilles will receive as a compensation for his own death:</p><p>|410 My mother Thetis, goddess with silver steps, tells me that |411 I carry the burden of two different fated ways [<em>kēres</em>] leading to the final moment [<em>telos</em>] of death. |412 If I stay here and fight at the walls of the city of the Trojans, |413 then my safe homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] will be destroyed for me, but I will have a glory [<em>kleos</em>] that is unwilting [<em>aphthiton</em>]. |414 Whereas if I go back home, returning to the dear land of my forefathers, |415 then it is my glory [<em>kleos</em>], genuine [<em>esthlon</em>] as it is, that will be destroyed for me, but my life force [<em>aiōn</em>] will then |416 last me a long time, and the final moment [<em>telos</em>] of death will not be swift in catching up with me. </p><p><em>Iliad</em> 9.410-416</p><p>The parallelisms in the wording that we see in these two passages highlight the parallelisms between Dēmophōn and Achilles as heroes who are linked with festivals. Just as the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, of the hero Dēmophōn takes the form of a seasonally recurring athletic event that is <em>aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Hymn to Demeter</em> 261, 263), because it will last forever, eternally recycled at the festival of the Eleusinian Games, so also the <em>kleos</em>, ‘glory’, of the hero Achilles takes the form of a seasonally recurring poetic event that is <em>aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Iliad</em> 9.413), because it too will last forever, eternally recycled in the context of a festival like the Panathenaia. </p>
