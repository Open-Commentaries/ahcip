<p>So, I maintain that the <em>kleos</em> of Homeric poetry is in its own right a seasonally recurring ritual event, since both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> were performed at the festival of the Panathenaia in Athens. And, as we have seen, the poetic event of a competition in performing the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> at the Panathenaia was parallel to the athletic event of a competition of <em>apobatai</em> at the same festival. This athletic event, as we have also seen, is comparable to the mock battle of the <em>Ballētus</em>, which was the primary athletic event of the Eleusinian Games and which qualifies as <em>tīmē aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting honor’, in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em> (261, 263), while the primary poetic event of performing epic at the Panathenaia qualifies as <em>kleos aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting glory’, in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> (9.413). </p>
