<p>What makes the athletic events of <em>Iliad</em> 23 appear to be different from the “real” athletic events of the historical period is this: whatever is happening in <em>Iliad</em> 23 appears to happen only once, whereas “real” athletic events are seasonally recurrent. We can see most clearly this concept of seasonally recurring re-enactment when we read the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demete</em>r 259-267. </p>
