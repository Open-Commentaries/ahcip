<p>The parallelisms in the wording of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter </em>and the <em>Iliad</em> highlight the parallelisms between Dēmophōn and Achilles as heroes who are linked with festivals. Just as the <em>tīmē</em>, ‘honor’, of the hero Dēmophōn takes the form of a seasonally recurring athletic event that is <em>aphthitos</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Hymn to Demeter</em> 261, 263), because it will last forever, eternally recycled at the festival of the Eleusinian Games, so also the <em>kleos</em>, ‘glory’, of the hero Achilles takes the form of a seasonally recurring poetic event that is <em>aphthiton</em>, ‘unwilting’ (<em>Iliad</em> 9.413), because it too will last forever, eternally recycled in the context of a festival like the Panathenaia. </p>
