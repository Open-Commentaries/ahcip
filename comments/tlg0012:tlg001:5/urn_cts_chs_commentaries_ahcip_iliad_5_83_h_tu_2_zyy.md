<p>This verse-final adjective <em>krataiḗ</em> can be explained as a morphologically leveled replacement of an older feminine form, to be reconstructed as *<em>krataí-u̯i-ă</em> and meaning ‘whose power [*<em>u̯i</em>-] has the upper-hand [<em>krátos</em>]’. The morphological leveling involves a replacement of the alternation *<em>-́i̯ă-</em>/<em>-i̯ā́-</em> by way of non-alternating *<em>-i̯ā́-</em>.</p>
