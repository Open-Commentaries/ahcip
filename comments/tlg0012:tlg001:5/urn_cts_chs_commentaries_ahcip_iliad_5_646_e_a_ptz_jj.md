<p>The idea of the ‘gates’ or <em>pulai</em> of Hadēs is a variant of the idea of a ‘gate’ or <em>Pulos</em> of the Sun, where the mythical idea of such a <em>Pulos</em> is parallel to the ritual reality of Pylos as a place where the myth is realized. By implication, the setting sun passes through the same gates as do the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead who are entering the underworld.  </p>
