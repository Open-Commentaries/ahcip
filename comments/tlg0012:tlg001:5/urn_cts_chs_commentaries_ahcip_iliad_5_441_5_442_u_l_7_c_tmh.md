<p>The word <em>phūlon</em> marks a given group as distinct from another group. In this case, the grouping of mortals is marked as distinct from the grouping of immortals as superhumans. Comparable is the word <em>phūlē</em>, which I have translated as ‘subdivision’ in the contexts of I.02.655–656 and I.02.668.  </p>
