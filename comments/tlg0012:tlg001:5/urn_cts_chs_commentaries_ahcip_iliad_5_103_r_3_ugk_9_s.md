<p>This verse shows that the hero Diomedes has a chance to qualify as the ‘best of the Achaeans’, <em>aristos Akhaiōn</em>. In the long run, however, in line with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it, Diomedes fails to qualify. Still, his greatest epic moments in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> are traditionally known as his <em>aristeiā</em> (as in the scholia for I.06.448), which I translate here as ‘epic high point’.  </p>
