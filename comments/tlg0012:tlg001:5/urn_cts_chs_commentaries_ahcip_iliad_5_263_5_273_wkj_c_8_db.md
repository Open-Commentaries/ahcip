<p>The genealogy of the Trojan Dardanidai is appropriated here into the genealogy of Athenian kings, and the references to a four-horse chariot team at I.05.271 is an Athenian signature. In the present action, however, at I.05.272â€“273, the four-horse team is reduced to a two-horse team, which is the canonical number for chariot teams in the <em>Iliad</em>.  </p>
