<p>lemmatizing: <strong>θήλεας ἵππους</strong></p><p>In the combination θήλεας ἵππους, the first-declension accusative plural in ‑<em>as</em>, positioned before a vowel, is scanned here as a short rather than long syllable. The attestation of such a form ‑<em>ăs</em> reflects not dialectal variation but formulaic simplification: an earlier complementary distribution of prevocalic *‑<em>ăns</em> (which becomes <em>-ās</em>) and preconsonantal *‑<em>ăs</em> is simplified, resulting in occasional instances of prevocalic ‑<em>ăs</em>.  </p>
