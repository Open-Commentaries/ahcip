<p>The wounding of the god Hādēs here with an arrow shot by Hēraklēs is associated with the place-name Pylos, <em>Pulos</em>, which is figured at I.05.397 here as a ‘gateway’ of the sun as it passes at sunset into the underworld. The name of Pylos as a place that can serve as a setting for ritual can stand for the name of a mythical place that is associated with the given ritual. Such a mythical place is the ‘gates of the Sun’. By implication, the setting sun passes through the same gates as do the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead who are entering the underworld.</p>
