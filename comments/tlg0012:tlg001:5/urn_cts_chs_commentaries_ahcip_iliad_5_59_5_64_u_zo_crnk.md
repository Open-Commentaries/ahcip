<p>This micro-narrative about Phereklos, a master carpenter who built that ships sailed by Paris=Alexandros for the abduction of Helen, concerns epic events that precede the narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it—but these events are here explained as the real beginning of that same narrative arc. In terms of this micro-narrative, the plot of the <em>Iliad</em>—in the sense that the name <em>Iliad</em> means ‘the story of Ilion [Troy]’—was started or even caused not by the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles, as our <em>Iliad</em> says at the beginning, but rather by an event that preceded that anger. According to this micro-narrative, what really started the Trojan War was the abduction of Helen, which was the <em>kakon</em> ‘bad thing’ that caused all the subsequent bad things, as we read here at I.05.063. And, as predicted at I.05.064, this same event caused the ‘bad thing’ that is about to happen to Phereklos himself. All these events, taken together, thus become part of the overarching plot of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it.</p>
