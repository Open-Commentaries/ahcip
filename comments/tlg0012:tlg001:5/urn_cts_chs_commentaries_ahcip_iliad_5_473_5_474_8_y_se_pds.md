<p>The “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Hector, <em>Hék-tōr</em>, is morphologically an agent noun derived from the verb <em>ekhein</em> ‘hold’, which can have the specialized sense of ‘uphold’ or ‘protect’ or ‘guard’, as in the present context. The expected role of Hector is <em>to protect the city of Troy</em>, and the direct object of <em>ekhein</em> ‘uphold, protect, guard’ here at I.05.473 is <em>polis</em> ‘city, citadel’, referring to Troy.  </p>
