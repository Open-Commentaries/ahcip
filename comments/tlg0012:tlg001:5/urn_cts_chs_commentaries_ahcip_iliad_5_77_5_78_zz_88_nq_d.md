<p>Wherever priests (as here at I.05.077–078 and at I.16.604–605) or kings (as in other Homeric contexts: I.10.032–033, I.13.217–218) are said to receive honor as conveyed by the verb <em>tīein</em> ‘honor, give honor to’ (or by the noun <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ and the verb <em>tīmân</em> ‘honor, give honor to’, as at I.12.310), Homeric diction is thereby referring indirectly to the receiving of hero cult by a cult hero; such reception happens in the localized context of the <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’. The cult of heroes is parallel to, though in some ways different from, the cult of gods, but the cult of gods is likewise conveyed by the verb <em>tīein</em> ‘honor, give honor to’ or by the noun <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ and the verb <em>tīmân</em> ‘honor, give honor to’.</p>
