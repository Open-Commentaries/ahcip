<p>The momentum of the war is spirited, and the fighting mood of the warriors verges on overreaching. An outstanding example is Diomedes, who already owns a glorious past as a conquering hero in the epic tradition known as the <em>Sons of the Seven against Thebes</em> or <em>Epigonoi</em>. Now in the epic present of the <em>Iliad</em> he has a chance to outdo himself, performing deeds so glorious that they would outshine perhaps even the deeds of Achilles, who is now out of the picture. The successes of Diomedes reach the point where he is capable of feats that are superhuman, as when he lifts a rock that even two humans today could not budge—or as when he wounds the god of war himself, Ares, and then, shortly thereafter, the goddess of love and sexuality, Aphrodite. But such momentum is not to last, and the antagonism of Diomedes toward divinities will have its consequences.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Aeneas_and_Diomedes_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Aeneas and Diomedes.” Wenceslaus Hollar (Bohemian, 1607–1677). <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wenceslas_Hollar_-_Aeneas_and_Diomedes.jpg">Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
