<p>The neuter plural <em>kukla</em> corresponding to masculine singular <em>kuklos</em> means ‘chariot wheels’. The metaphorical use of <em>kuklos</em> ‘cycle, chariot wheel’ with reference to the epic Cycle as the sum total of Homeric poetry is relevant to the meaning of <em>Homēros</em> in the sense of a ‘joiner, carpenter’ who makes chariot wheels. See the comment on O.17.384–385. </p>
