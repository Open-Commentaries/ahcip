<p>These verses show the fatally serious difficulties encountered in differentiating between mortals and immortals, in the context of similes comparing mortals to immortals by way of words like <em>hoios </em>‘such as’ and <em>enalinkios</em> ‘looking like’; of special relevance are these two words: <em>īsos</em> ‘equal to’ and <em>atalantos</em> ‘equal to’. Here at I.05.440–442, the idea of being <em>īsos</em> ‘equal to’ a divinity is made parallel with the idea of thinking ‘in ways that are equal’, <em>īsa</em>, to divine ways of thinking. These ideas are part of the larger idea, centering on a basic pattern of antagonism between divinity and hero.</p>
