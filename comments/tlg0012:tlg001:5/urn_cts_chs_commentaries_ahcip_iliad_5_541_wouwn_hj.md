<p>Aeneas here kills two Achaeans=Danaans, who are described as ‘the best [<em>aristoi</em>] of the Danaans’. But the use of the plural <em>aristoi</em> in the sense of ‘best’ does not convey the same kind of zero-sum competition among the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives as does the use of the singular <em>aristos</em> in the sense of ‘the very best’.  </p>
