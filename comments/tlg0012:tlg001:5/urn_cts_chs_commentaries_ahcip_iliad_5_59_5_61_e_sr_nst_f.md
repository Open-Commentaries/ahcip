<p>The collocation of <em>tektonos huion</em> (τέκτονος υἱόν) ‘son of the joiner [<em>tektōn</em>]’ at I.05.059 with <em>Harmonideō</em> (Ἁρμονίδεω) ‘son of <em>Harmōn</em>’ at I.05.059 indicates three generations of ‘joiners’, in that Phereklos is a son of a joiner who is in turn a son of a joiner. The grandfather <em>Harmōn</em> has a name that can be reconstructed as a noun *<em>ar-s-mōn</em>, derived from the verb <em>ar-ar-iskein</em> ‘fit together, join together’. And the grandson Phereklos is said at I.05.061 to have ‘built-as-a-carpenter’, <em>tektainesthai</em> (τεκτήνατο), the ships sailed by Paris=Alexandros for the abduction of Helen. This verb <em>tektainein</em> is derived from the noun <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’, which is in turn derived from the verb-root *<em>tek(s)-</em>. No longer attested in Greek, this verb-root *<em>tek(s)-</em> survives in Latin as <em>texō</em>, which can refer to the craft of woodworking, not only the craft of weaving. On verbal art as woodwork, see HC 2§282n. </p>
