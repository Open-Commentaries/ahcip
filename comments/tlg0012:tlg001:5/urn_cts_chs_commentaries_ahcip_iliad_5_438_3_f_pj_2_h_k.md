<p>Diomedes is <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a superhuman force [<em>daimōn</em>]’ when this hero dares to attack the god Apollo. Ultimately, he backs off. The use of this expression <em>daimoni</em> <em>īsos</em> ‘equal to a superhuman force [<em>daimōn</em>]’ here at I.05.438, and also again at I.05.459, goes to the core of the central idea of ritualized <em>antagonism between</em> immortal and mortal.  </p>
