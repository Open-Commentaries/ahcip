<p>The hero Mudōn is identified here as both a <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ and a <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’. The collocation of these nouns <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ and <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ in describing Mudōn here implies that he functions as a ritual substitute for an unnamed hero who is primarily a chariot fighter.</p>
