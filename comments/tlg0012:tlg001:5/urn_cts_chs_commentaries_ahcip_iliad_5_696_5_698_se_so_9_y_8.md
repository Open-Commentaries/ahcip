<p>At the moment of his fainting or swooning here, the hero’s <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ in the sense of his ‘life’s breath’ is released from his body. But then he ‘comes to’, as it were, and now his life’s breath returns to him. The verb that expresses this idea of revival is <em>ana-pneîn</em> (ἀμπνύνθη)—variant <em>en-pneîn</em> (ἐμπνύνθη)—in the sense of ‘taking a breath’—‘breathing in’. So, the hero’s breath comes back into him, and that is what had left him when his <em>psūkhē</em> in the sense of ‘life’s breath’ had left him. But if we take this same word <em>psūkhē</em> in the sense of a disembodied ‘spirit’, then the spirit that has come back to the hero’s body has not only revived him: it has brought him back to life. Such a mystical sense of revival is most appropriate to the hero Sarpedon when we view a later point in the narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: after he is killed in battle, Sarpedon’s funeral leads to his mystical immortalization.  </p>
