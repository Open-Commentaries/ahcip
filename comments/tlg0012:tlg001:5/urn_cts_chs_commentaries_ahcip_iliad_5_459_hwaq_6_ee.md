<p>Retrospectively, Apollo in his own words is saying that Diomedes was <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a <em>daimōn</em>’ when this hero dared to attack the god. The use of this expression <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a <em>daimōn</em>’ here at I.05.459, and also before at I.05.438, goes to the core of the central idea of <em>antagonism between immortal and mortal</em>. Most relevant are the intervening verses at I.05.440–442.  </p>
