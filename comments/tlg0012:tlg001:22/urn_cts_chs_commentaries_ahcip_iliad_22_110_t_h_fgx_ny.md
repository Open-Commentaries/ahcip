<p>Hector is well aware that he may die at the hands of Achilles, but he wishes to die in a way that will assure him of having the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry, and such ‘genuine’ glory, as marked by the prefix <em>eü</em>- of the adverb <em>eü-kleiōs</em> ‘with the genuine glory [<em>kleos</em>] (of poetry)’, is simultaneously ‘good’ glory, as also in the case of the adjective <em>esthlon</em> ‘genuine, good’ as epithet of <em>kleos</em> at I.18.121. See the comment on I.18.121. The overriding ambition of Hector to achieve the genuine <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry is recognized at the end of Andromache’s second lament, I.22.514. See the comment on I.22.514.  </p>
