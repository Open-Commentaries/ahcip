<p>Like Helen at I.03.125–128, Andromache is shown here at I.22.440–441 in the act of pattern-weaving. And, like Helen, she is not pictured as singing while weaving: rather, she weaves her song into the web that she pattern-weaves. The song that she weaves into her web is pictured as <em>throna</em>, which can mean ‘flower patterns’ or ‘love charms’. It can be argued that both meanings apply in the present context. A similar argument can be made in the case of the epithet <em>poikilo-thronos</em> applied to the goddess Aphrodite in Sappho Song 1.1: this word can mean either ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] flower patterns [that are pattern-woven on your robe]’ or ‘with varied [<em>poikilo</em>-] love charms’. See further at MoM 2§76 (also PasP 101n40). Further, at I.22.441, there exists a variant epithet for the web that Andromache weaves: this <em>diplax</em> ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’ is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. And we find the same variation of epithets for the web that Helen weaves at I.03.126: this <em>diplax</em> too is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. Similarly, the antux ‘rim’ that is being made for the Shield of Achilles at I.18.479 is described as triplax ‘threefold’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ at I.18.480. In Eustathius <em>Commentary on the Iliad</em> vol. 4 p. 218 lines 14–17, the commentator draws attention to the morphological parallelism of <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’ with <em>diplax</em> ‘twofold’. So, Eustathius recognizes here a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. See the comment on I.18.479–480. See also the comment on I.09.130, where it is argued that the craft of pattern-weaving by Aeolian women is linked with the power of the craft of Homeric poetry to make contact with the Bronze Age. Finally, in the case of the two textual variants <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ and <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ as applied to the web of Helen at I.03.126 and to the web of Andromache at I.22.441, we learn from the scholia for I.03.126 that <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ happened to be the reading preferred by all three major Alexandrian editors of Homer—Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Aristarchus (see also HPC 274nn3, 4).  </p>
