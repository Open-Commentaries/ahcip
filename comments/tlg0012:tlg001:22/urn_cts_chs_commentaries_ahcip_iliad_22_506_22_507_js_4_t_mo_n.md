<p>Here at I.22.506–507, the meaning of the name of Hector is made explicit. As noted already in the comment on I.06.402–403, the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. This meaning is relevant to the heroic role of the father as <em>protecting a citadel from sieges</em>. This role is expressed by the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Hector, <em>Héktōr</em>, which is an agent noun meaning ‘one who holds [<em>ekhein</em>]’. The translation ‘hold’ here conveys the sense of ‘uphold, protect, guard’: so Hector’s name destines him to be the ‘protector’ of the city of Troy. See the comment on I.05.473–474. The name of Hector is relevant to the fact that Hector’s son is named after him. More than that, Hector’s son is named after the primary function of Hector as signaled by the father’s name, and the rationale for that naming is made explicit at I.22.506–507: as Andromache says to her dead husband here, Astyanax is named Astyanax or ‘king of the city’ precisely because his father was protector of the city. Here is the wording at I.22.507: ‘because you [= <em>Héktōr</em>], all by yourself, protected [<em>eruesthai</em>] for them [= the Trojans] the gates and the walls [of their city]’ (οἶος γάρ σφιν ἔρυσο πύλας καὶ τείχεα μακρά). We see at work here the mythological convention of naming a son after a primary heroic trait of the father, as in the case of the son of Ajax, whose name <em>Eurusakēs</em> means ‘the one with the wide shield [<em>sakos</em>]’; this meaning is made explicit in the wording of Sophocles Ajax 574–578. In the case of Hector’s name as <em>Hék-tōr</em> or ‘protector’, there is a serious danger portended by his function as protector of the citadel of Troy: this heroic function of Hector makes him a rival of the goddess Athena in her own divine function as protector of the same citadel of Troy. See the comment on I.06.286–311, especially with reference to the epithet of Athena as <em>erusi-ptolis</em> ‘protector of the citadel [<em>p(t)olis</em>]’ at I.06.305.  </p>
