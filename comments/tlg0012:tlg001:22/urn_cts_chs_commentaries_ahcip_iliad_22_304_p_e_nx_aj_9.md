<p>Hector is now quite certain that he will in fact die at the hands of Achilles, but he wishes all the more to die in a way that will assure him of having the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry, and such ‘genuine’ glory is marked here by the negation of the adverb <em>a-kleiōs</em> ‘without the genuine glory [<em>kleos</em>] (of poetry)’. What he is saying, then, is that he wishes not to die without being assured of the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry. He has already been saying that at I.22.110. See also the comment on I.22.110, where it is already noted that the overarching ambition of Hector to achieve the genuine <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry is recognized at the end of Andromache’s second lament, I.22.514. See the comment on I.22.514.  </p>
