<p>In the lament of Andromache, she refers here at I.22.483 to the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ that the death of Hector has caused her. This word <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is a programmatic marker of lament, as we have already seen at I.09.562–564, where a songbird is pictured as singing a song of lament: that songbird is the <em>halkúōn</em> ‘halcyon’, described in that context as <em>polupenthēs</em> ‘having much grief’, I.09.563. See the relevant comment on I.09.561–564.  </p>
