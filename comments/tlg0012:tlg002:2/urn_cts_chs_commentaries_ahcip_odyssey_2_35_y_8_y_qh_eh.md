<p>The speech of the old man Aiguptios, O.02.025–034, is described by the Master Narrator as a <em>phēmē</em> ‘something said’, O.02.035. This translation ‘something said’ does not fully capture, however, the deeper meaning of the word, which is something like this: <em>something said that means more than what is meant by the one who says it</em>. Such a deeper meaning is made explicit at O.20.100 and O.20.105. See the comment at O.20.098-121, [HR]3§23. This interpretation of the meaning of <em>phēmē</em> is relevant to the meaning of the &quot;speaking name&quot; (nomen loquens) of Phemios the singer: the adjectival <em>Phēmios</em> is a derivative of <em>phēmē</em>. Accordingly, Phemios is a singer whose songs mean more than what is meant by that singer. See the comment on O.01.342. </p>
