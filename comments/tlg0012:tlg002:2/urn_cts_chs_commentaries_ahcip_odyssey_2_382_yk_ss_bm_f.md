<p>This line marks the first occurrence in the <em>Odyssey</em> of a formulaic expression"then he/she thought of other things"(ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἀλλ᾽ ἐνόησε) that occurs, with minor variations, eleven times in the <em>Odyssey</em> and twice in the <em>Iliad</em>. The formula shows interesting patterns of restriction in both poems. In the <em>Odyssey</em>, it is always used with a female subject (Athena [2.382, 2.393, 4.795, 5.382, 6.112, 18.187, 23.242, 23.344], Helen [4.219], Nausikaa [6.251], or Penelope [16.409]). In the <em>Iliad</em>, it is used exclusively of Achilles (23.140, 23.193). See <em>Iliad</em> 23.140 for discussion of the two Iliadic instances; here I concentrate on the formula’s occurrences in the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
<p>From a narratological point of view, the expression has an important function: as noted by de Jong 2001:66, it “highlights a new, often sudden or unexpected turn in the story,” in this case “the—abrupt—change of scene from Telemachus to Athena.” In other words, the formula marks the development of the plot in a new direction that is not a mere continuation of what has preceded. (<em>Odyssey</em><em> </em>23.242 is a significant exception.) Furthermore, it links this new development with the intervention of some specific agent, who is thus momentarily represented as controlling the plot. De Jong 2001:66 notes that the frequency with which the expression is used of Athena corresponds to the goddess’s “role of ‘director’ of the story of the <em>Odyssey</em>.” Occurrences of the formula with Helen, Nausikaa, and Penelope as subjects extend this plot-making power to other prominent women. In this way, a convenient narrative device serves also to underscore one of the poem’s major thematic concerns, namely, the way in which the story of Odysseus’ homecoming—the plot of the <em>Odyssey</em>—depends upon the favorable disposition of certain women, above all Penelope. The poem has numerous ways of signaling that its plot hinges on female agents (see <em>Odyssey </em>11.226, <em>Odyssey </em>11.436-39). This should not, however, be interpreted as a subversive gesture: as stressed by Murnaghan 2005, Athena as “source and sponsor” of the <em>Odyssey</em>’s plot works to uphold the authority of the patriarchal <em>oikos</em>.</p>
