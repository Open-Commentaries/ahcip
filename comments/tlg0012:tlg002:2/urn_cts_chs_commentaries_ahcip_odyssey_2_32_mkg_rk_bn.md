<p>The verb <em>piphauskesthai</em> ‘say formally’, referring here to what is being spoken in the <em>agorē</em> ‘assembly’, can be compared with the active form of the verb, <em>piphauskein</em> ‘say formally’, as it is used at I.18.500 in the context of describing what is happening at an <em>agorē</em> ‘assembly’, I.18.497, which is the context for the litigation scene as depicted on the Shield of Achilles. Whatever is spoken at an assembly like the one that is now in progress, O.02.032, can qualify as <em>dēmion</em> ‘of the community [<em>dēmos</em>]’ <em>if it is public business, not private business</em>. If whatever is spoken at the assembly qualifies as public business, then it is the business of the <em>dēmos</em>. See also the comment on O.02.080. On <em>dēmos</em> as ‘community, district’, see O.01.103; see also I.05.077–078, with cross-references there. </p>
