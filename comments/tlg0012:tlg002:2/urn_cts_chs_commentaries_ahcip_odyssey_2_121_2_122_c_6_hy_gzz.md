<p>The mental feats of Penelope are described here as <em>noēmata</em> ‘feats of the mind [<em>nóos</em>]’ that are incomparable to any other woman’s feats. The comparison is expressed by way of the adjective <em>homoio-</em> ‘similar to, same as’ (analysis in MoM 2§12). This adjective <em>homoio-</em> ‘similar to, same as’ can be used in comparisons that express rhetorically the incomparability of the referent, as here. </p>
