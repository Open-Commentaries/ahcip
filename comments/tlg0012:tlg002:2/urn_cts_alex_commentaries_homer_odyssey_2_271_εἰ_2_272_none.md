<p>The idea that <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’, O.02.271, has been <em>instilled</em> into Telemachus by his father is conveyed here by the verb <em>stazein</em>, which literally means ‘drip’. We may compare line 35 of Archilochus F 196A (ed. West), where <em>menos</em> refers explicitly to ejaculated semen. For other references to male arousal by way of words referring to mental power, see Nagy 1974:267–268. [[GN 2017.03.08.]]</p><p>#menos ‘mental power’</p>
