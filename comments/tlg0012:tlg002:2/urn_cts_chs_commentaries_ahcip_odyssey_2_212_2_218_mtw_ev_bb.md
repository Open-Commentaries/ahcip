<p>Athena’s idea of conducting Telemachus on a journey to Pylos and Sparta is introduced, as we saw, already at O.01.088–095. See the comment there. Here too at O.02.212–218, as there, <em>nostos</em> in the sense of ‘song of homecoming’ is the direct object of the verb <em>punthanesthai</em> ‘learn’, O.02.215, and also the direct object of the verb <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’, O.02.218. Elsewhere too in the <em>Odyssey</em>, we see <em>nostos</em> as the direct object of <em>punthanesthai</em> ‘learn’: O.02.264, O.02.360, O.04.714. Also of <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’: O.01.094, O.01.287, O.02.360. Further, such <em>nostos</em> as ‘song of homecoming’ is linked with <em>kleos</em> ‘glory (of poetry)’, as at least indirectly at O.02.217 here. </p>
