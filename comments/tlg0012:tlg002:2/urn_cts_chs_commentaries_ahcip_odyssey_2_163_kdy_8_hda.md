<p>The oncoming <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ is pictured here as a boulder that breaks off from mountainous heights overhead and starts rolling downward from above, ever increasing in speed as it nears ground zero: only when the boulder has reached a level plain does it finally stop ‘rolling’, as expressed by the verb <em>kulindesthai</em>. For other instances of such an image, see the comment on I.11.347, with cross-references. </p><p></p>
