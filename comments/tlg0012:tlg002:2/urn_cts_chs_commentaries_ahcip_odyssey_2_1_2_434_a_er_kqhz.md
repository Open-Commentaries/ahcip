<p>The mentoring of Telemachus by Athena continues. First the goddess was <em>Méntēs</em>. Now she will become <em>Méntōr</em> to the young hero. Through the mentorship of the goddess, Telemachus modulates into mental connectivity: he will no longer be disconnected from the epic legacy of his father. As he boards the ship that will take him to Pylos, he is ready to connect with the <em>Odyssey</em> in progress.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/OdysseyTelemachos.png" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Telemachus with Athena as Mentor (1810).
