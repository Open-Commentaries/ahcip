<p>This adverb <em>endukéōs </em>‘continuously, uninterruptedly’ expresses the idea of an uninterrupted sequence. The opposite of this adverb <em>endukéōs</em> ‘continuously, uninterruptedly’can be seen in the adjective <em>adeukḗs</em>, which can be interpreted as ‘discontinuous, interrupting’. See the anchor comment at O.04.489. In terms of this interpretation, the root <em>duk-/deuk-</em> for this adverb/adjective conveys the sense of ‘continue’. </p>
