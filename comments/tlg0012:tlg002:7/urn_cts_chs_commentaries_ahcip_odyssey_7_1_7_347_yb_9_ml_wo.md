<p>Odysseus arrives at the palace and garden of Alkinoos (Alcinous), king of the Phaeacians, whose island was equated in ancient times with Kerkyra/Corcyra, the modern Corfù. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/d9128a02859d90f3a2bb67cb43156ea6_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>View of Garitsa, region right outside the northern walls of the city of Corfu, and according to the legend the site of Alcinous’s gardens (1867). Étienne Rey (French, 1789–1867). <a href="http://eng.travelogues.gr/item.php?view=51420">Image</a> via the Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Following the instructions of Nausicaa, Odysseus approaches the palace of her father Alkinoos (latinized as Alcinous), king of the Phaeacians. This palace and the adjacent garden of Alkinoos are not only enchanting but even enchanted, as will be argued in the comments for Rhapsody 7 here. And, as we will see later in the comments for Rhapsody 13, the garden of Alkinoos was thought to have survived on the island of Kerkyra, known in Roman sources as Corcyra and in modern times as Corfù. In ancient times, the people of Kerkyra claimed that their island was in fact the fabled realm of the Phaeacians.</p>
