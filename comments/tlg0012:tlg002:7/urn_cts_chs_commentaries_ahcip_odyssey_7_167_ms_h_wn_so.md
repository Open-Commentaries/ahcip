<p>Alkinoos here qualifies for an epithet that would mean ‘he whose mental-power [<em>menos</em>] is sacred [<em>hieron</em>]’. Instead, however, the name of Alkinoos is expressed periphrastically: ‘the sacred [<em>hieron</em>] mental-power [<em>menos</em>] of Alkinoos’, as if the agency of the king originated from his mental power, not from his existence as a person.
