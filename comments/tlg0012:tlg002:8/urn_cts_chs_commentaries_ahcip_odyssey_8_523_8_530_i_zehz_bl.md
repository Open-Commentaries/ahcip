<p>We see here a simile comparing Odysseus to a weeping widow, and this simile is comparable to what happens to Andromache at the end of the Iliou Persis. We see here a relevance to the distinction between kleos and penthos (Odysseus’ weeping at Demodokos’ songs)</p>
<p>We can compare Andromache’s lament in Iliad 24 and Kleopatre’s stance of lamentation in Iliad 09</p>
<p>Context: we see here a description of Odysseus as experiencing akhos when he hears Demodokos’ third song as signaling the form of the epic as that of the Cycle</p>
