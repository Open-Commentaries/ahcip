<p>Alkinoos wishes that the feasting should continue and that Odysseus should continue to ‘feel delight’, as expressed by <em>terpesthai</em>, while he hears at this feast the ‘weaving’ of the <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ that started with the First Song of Demodokos and that will now connect with the Third Song. In this context, we see the meaning of the noun <em>dais</em> extended from the specific idea of ‘feast’ to the more general idea of a stylized‘festival’. And the continued weaving of the song, which corresponds to the continuation of the stylized festival, is expressed here by way of the noun <em>humnos</em>, which is attested only here and nowhere else in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em>. In this unique context at O.08.429, the meaning of <em>humnos</em> can be reconstructed as ‘web’ or ‘connecting by way of fabric work’. In terms of such a reconstructed meaning, the <em>humnos</em> as a ‘web’ connects the First and the Second and the Third Songs of Demodokos and forms a continuum of song that extends throughout <em>Odyssey</em> 8, as if the ongoing <em>dais</em> of this Rhapsody were not only a continued <em>feast</em> but also a sustained <em>festival</em>. This festival makes room for events of athletics as well as songmaking. </p>
