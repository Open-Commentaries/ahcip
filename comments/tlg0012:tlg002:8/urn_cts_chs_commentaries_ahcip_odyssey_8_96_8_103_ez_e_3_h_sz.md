<p>Alkinoos pauses the dining and the singing, though the <em>dais</em> at O.08.098 and at O.08.098 in the general sense of ‘feasting’ can continue. But now, instead of dining and singing, what will commence are <em>aethloi</em> (<em>āthloi</em>) in the sense of ‘athletic contests’, O.08.100. Listed at O.08.103 are athletic events in boxing, wrestling, long-jump, and footracing. </p>
