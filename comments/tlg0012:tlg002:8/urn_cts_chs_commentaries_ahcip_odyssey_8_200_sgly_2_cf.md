<p>Here at O.08.200 the word <em>agōn</em> ‘competition’ is used with reference to a continuum of competitive athletic events. In this context, it becomes clear that the entire series of athletic events in this festive continuum can be viewed as an <em>agōn</em> ‘competition’. See also O.08.238.  </p>
