<p>In <a href="http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/to-trace-a-thread-of-thought-starting-from-a-homeric-song-that-seems-to-have-no-ending/" target="_blank">Classical Inquiries</a>, I note:</p>
<p>The epic singing of the first song of Demodokos in <em>Odyssey</em> 8, once it gets started by the <em>prooimion</em> as indicated by the syntax at verse 74, keeps getting restarted. Whenever the performer ‘leaves off’, as indicated by the word <em>lēgein</em> at verse 87, he keeps on ‘restarting’ the epic, as indicated by the wording <em>aps arkhesthai</em> ‘start again and again’ at verse 90. The continual restarting creates the effect of an endless narrative: the epic performance of the first song of Demodokos seems to have no end in sight.</p>
