<p>The king Alkinoos ‘sacrifices’, as indicated by the verb <em>hiereuein</em> at O.08.059, a number of sacrificial animals. They are twelve sheep, eight pigs and two head of cattle, as indicated at O.08.059–060, and the meat of these sacrificial animals will now be prepared for a <em>dais</em> ‘feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’, as indicated at O.08.061—and as already indicated earlier at O.08.038. As noted in the comment on O.08.038, the <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ that is planned by king Alkinoos for his guest will be rethought as a stylized festival, centering on a sacrifice that leads to a division of meat at the feast. Such a festival will continue from here in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 all the way to the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 13. </p>
