<p>Before the singer starts singing, the Phaeacians and their unidentified guest are already feasting: they partake of both food and drink, O.08.072. The eating and drinking had begun at O.08.071, signaled already at O.08.061 by the noun <em>dais</em> ‘feast, feasting’. As we will see later, however, the singing itself is part of the <em>dais</em> ‘feasting’. </p>
