<p>Alkinoos the king is addressing his subjects, the Phaeacians, and he speaks of the ‘escort’ that he plans to provide for the stranger who has not yet identified himself as Odysseus. The word that I translate as ‘escort’ here is <em>pompē</em>: O.08.030, O.08.031, O.08.033. And the word that I translate as ‘stranger’ is <em>xenos</em>: O.08.028. Alkinoos intends to be a host to this stranger, treating him as a ‘guest’, and the word that I translate as ‘guest’ here is likewise <em>xenos</em>, O.08.042. What Alkinoos plans to offer his guest is a <em>dais</em>, which refers on the surface to a ‘feast’. The feast will evidently include a dinner, O.08.042, and this dinner will include entertainment in the form of ‘singing’, the noun for which is <em>aoidē</em> at O.08.044 and the verb for which is <em>aeidein</em> at O.08.045. The one who will be singing is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’, O.08.043, whose name is Demodokos, O.08.044. This singer’s singing ‘gives delight’, as expressed by way of the verb <em>terpein</em>, O.08.045.  </p>
