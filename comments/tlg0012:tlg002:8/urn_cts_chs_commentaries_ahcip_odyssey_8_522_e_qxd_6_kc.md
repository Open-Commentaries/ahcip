<p>The metaphor of ‘dissolving’ into tears while weeping, as expressed here by way of the verb <em>tēkesthai</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’, extends into a further metaphor: with your own tears, you can be ‘pouring all over’ a loved one whom you are embracing: see the comment at O.08.527. Further relevant comments at O.19.204–212.  </p>
