<p>At O.08.581–583, Alkinoos asks the unrecognized Odysseus: does the singing of Demodokos about the Trojan War make you sad because you lost a relative in that war? Then, he asks an alternative question at O.08.584–586: or did you lose a <em>hetairos</em> ‘companion’ in the Trojan War? Well, Odysseus did in fact lose many companions, but the greatest of them all was Achilles. Pointedly, Alkinoos refers to the sadness of Odysseus as <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ at O.08.541. In Homeric poetry, this word <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ conjures the name of Achilles himself, as I noted already in the comment on I.01.002. </p>
