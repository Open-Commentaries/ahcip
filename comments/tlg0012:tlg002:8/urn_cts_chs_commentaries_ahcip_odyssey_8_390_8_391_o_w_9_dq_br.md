<p>Alkinoos says that the kingdom of the Phaeacians, described here as a <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’, is ruled by twelve <em>basilēes</em> ‘kings’, O.08.390, and that he counts himself as the thirteenth. (On <em>krainein</em> in the sense of ‘authorize’ and thereby ‘rule’, see GMP 59.) In terms of this description, Alkinoos figures himself as an over-king, and maybe the word <em>basilēes</em> here has the meaning of ‘sub-kings’—which is in fact the meaning of the corresponding word <em>g</em>w<em>asilēwes</em> (qa-si-re-we) in Linear B texts. According to Frame 2009 ch. 7, the twelve kings of the Phaeacians may represent a mythological replica of the confederation known as the Ionian Dodecapolis as it existed around the late eighth and early seventh centuries BCE. (On the Ionian Dodecapolis, see the anchor comment on I.01.463; also the comment on I.02.867–869 and on I.20.403–405.) </p>
