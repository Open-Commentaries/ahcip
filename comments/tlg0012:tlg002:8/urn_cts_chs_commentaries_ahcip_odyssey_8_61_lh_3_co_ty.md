<p>[Epitomized from MoM 4§73:] The noun <em>dais </em>‘feast’, as we see it used here at O.08.061, is derived from the verb <em>daiesthai</em> in the basic sense of ‘distribute ’, which is used in contexts of animal sacrifice in referring to the ‘distribution’ of cooked meat among the members of a community, as at O.15.140 and O.17.332. Then, by way of synecdoche, the specific idea of <em>distribution</em> extends metonymically to the general idea of <em>feasting</em> and further to the even more general idea of a <em>festival</em>. Following the logic of this sequence of meanings, we see that the animal sacrifice at O.08.059 had led to the cooking and the distribution of the meat, O.08.061, which will lead to communal dining, O.08.071–072, which will lead to the First Song of Demodokos, O.08.073–083, and so on. On <em>metonymy</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. In terms of this logic, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> in the sense of ‘feast’ here at O.08.061 marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals: animal sacrifice, communal feasting, singing as well as dancing at the feast. As we will see in comments that follow, this <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ as signaled at O.08.061 will be rethought as a stylized festival, centering on a sacrifice that leads to a division of meat at the feast. Such a festival will continue from here in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 all the way to the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 13.</p>
