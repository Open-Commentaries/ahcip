<p>The subject of the song is the <em>philotēs</em> ‘sexual bonding’ of Ares and Aphrodite. The adulterous lovers will be caught in the act by the husband of Aphrodite, Hephaistos. The introduction of the story by way of the preposition <em>amphi</em> ‘about’ is typical of hymns. The story of the sexual encounter of Ares and Aphrodite is typical of a genre known as <em>divine burlesque</em>, on which see the comment on I.21.385–514. The subject of such a <em>philotēs</em> ‘sexual bonding’ is treated seriously by Empedocles DK B 35. </p>
