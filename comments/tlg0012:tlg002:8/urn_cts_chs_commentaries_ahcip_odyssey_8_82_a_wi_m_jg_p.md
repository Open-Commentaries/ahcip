<p>The micro-epic of Demodokos as embedded in <em>Odyssey </em>8.73–82, merges the poetic agenda that are kept separate in the macro-epics of the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. And, correspondingly, this same micro-epic merges the plan of Zeus as it operates in the <em>Iliad</em> with the plan of Zeus as it operates in the <em>Odyssey</em>. These mergers are compatible with the plural form <em>boulai</em> ‘plans’ referring to the plot of the micro-epic at verse 82 of <em>Odyssey</em> 8, as opposed to the singular form <em>boulē</em> ‘plan’ referring to the plot of the macro-epic at verse 5 of <em>Iliad</em> 1. Likewise in the <em>Odyssey</em>, as the book of Jim Marks has shown clearly, the whole plot of this macro-epic is driven by a singular plan of Zeus.</p><p>Bibliographical references</p><p>Marks, J. 2008. <em>Zeus in the Odyssey</em>.
