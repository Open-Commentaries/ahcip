<p>|250 “ἀλλ’ ἄγε, Φαιήκων βητάρμονες ὅσσοι ἄριστοι, |251 παίσατε, ὥς χ’ ὁ ξεῖνος ἐνίσπῃ οἷσι φίλοισιν, |252 οἴκαδε νοστήσας, ὅσσον περιγινόμεθ’ ἄλλων |253 ναυτιλίῃ καὶ ποσσὶ καὶ ὀρχηστυῖ καὶ ἀοιδῇ. |254 Δημοδόκῳ δέ τις αἶψα κιὼν φόρμιγγα λίγειαν |255 οἰσέτω, ἥ που κεῖται ἐν ἡμετέροισι δόμοισιν.” |256 ὣς ἔφατ’ Ἀλκίνοος θεοείκελος, ὦρτο δὲ κῆρυξ |257 οἴσων φόρμιγγα γλαφυρὴν δόμου ἐκ βασιλῆος. |258 αἰσυμνῆται δὲ κριτοὶ ἐννέα πάντες ἀνέσταν, |259 δήμιοι, οἳ κατ’ ἀγῶνα ἐῢ πρήσσεσκον ἕκαστα, |260 λείηναν δὲ χορόν, καλὸν δ’ εὔρυναν ἀγῶνα. |261 κῆρυξ δ’ ἐγγύθεν ἦλθε φέρων φόρμιγγα λίγειαν |262 Δημοδόκῳ· ὁ δ’ ἔπειτα κί’ ἐς μέσον· ἀμφὶ δὲ κοῦροι |263 πρωθῆβαι ἵσταντο, δαήμονες ὀρχηθμοῖο, |264 πέπληγον δὲ χορὸν θεῖον ποσίν. αὐτὰρ ᾿Οδυσσεὺς |265 μαρμαρυγὰς θηεῖτο ποδῶν, θαύμαζε δὲ θυμῷ. |266 αὐτὰρ ὁ φορμίζων ἀνεβάλλετο καλὸν ἀείδειν |267 ἀμφ’ Ἄρεος φιλότητος ἐϋστεφάνου τ’ Ἀφροδίτης, |268 ὡς τὰ πρῶτ’ ἐμίγησαν ἐν Ἡφαίστοιο δόμοισι |269 λάθρῃ. [The story that has just started at line 266 now continues, ending at line 366.] |367 ταῦτ’ ἄρ’ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός· αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς |368 τέρπετ’ ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἀκούων ἠδὲ καὶ ἄλλοι |369 Φαίηκες δολιχήρετμοι, ναυσικλυτοὶ ἄνδρες. (At line 267, there is a variant reading attested: φιλότητα in the accusative, instead of φιλότητος in the genitive.)</p><p>|250 [Alkinoos is speaking.] “Let’s get started. I want the best of the Phaeacian acrobatic dancers [<em>bētarmones</em>] |251 to perform their sportive dance [<em>paizein</em>], so that the stranger, our guest, will be able to tell his near-and-dear ones, |252 when he gets home, how much better we (Phaeacians) are than anyone else |253 in sailing and in footwork, in dance [<em>orkhēstus</em>] and song [<em>aoidē</em>]. |254 One of you go and get for Demodokos the clear-sounding special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>], |255 bringing it to him. It is in the palace somewhere.” |256 Thus spoke Alkinoos, the one who looks like the gods, and the herald [<em>kērux</em>] got up, |257 ready to bring the well carved special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>] from the palace of the king. |258 And the organizers [<em>aisumnētai</em>], the nine selectmen, all got up |259 —they belonged to the district [<em>dēmos</em>]—and they started arranging everything according to the rules of the competition [<em>agōn</em>]: |260 they made smooth the place of the singing-and-dancing [<em>khoros</em>], and they made a wide space of competition [<em>agōn</em>]. |261 The herald [<em>kērux</em>] came near, bringing the clear-sounding special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>] |262 for Demodokos. He [= Demodokos] moved to the center [<em>es meson</em>] of the space. At his right and at his left were boys [kouroi] |263 in the first stage of adolescence [<em>prōthēboi</em>], standing there, well versed in dancing [<em>orkhēthmos</em>]. |264 They pounded out with their feet a dance [<em>khoros</em>], a thing of wonder, and Odysseus |265 was observing the sparkling footwork. He was amazed in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>]. |266 And he [= Demodokos], playing on the special lyre [<em>phormizein</em>], started [<em>anaballesthai</em>] singing beautifully |267 about [<em>amphi</em>] the bonding [<em>philotēs</em>] of Ares and of Aphrodite, the one with the beautiful garlands [<em>stephanoi</em>], |268 about how they, at the very beginning, mated with each other in the palace of Hephaistos, |269 in secret. [The story that has just started at line 266 now continues, ending at line 366.] |367 These things, then, the singer [<em>aoidos</em>] was singing [<em>aeidein</em>], that very famous singer. As for Odysseus, |368 he felt delight [<em>terpesthai</em>] in his heart as he was listening—and so too did all the others feel, |369 the Phaeacians, those men with their long oars, men famed for their ships.</p><p>As we are about to see, the Second Song of Demodokos is remarkably different from the First and the Third Songs—not only in form but also in content.</p>
