<p>The expression <em>aristoi Akhaiōn</em> (ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν) at verse 78, which I translate as ‘the best of the Achaeans’, here is in the plural, and nowhere else in either the <em>Iliad</em> or the <em>Odyssey</em> do we find such a plural (for a different, distributive plural by implication of this same expression 'best of the Achaeans', see my note on <a href="/commentary?wordpressId=166668">Iliad 8.228-235</a>). Rather, we find the singular <em>aristos Akhaiōn</em> (ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν), which I again translate as ‘the best of the Achaeans’. Although many heroes contend for this title in the macro-epic of the <em>Iliad</em>, only one of them, Achilles, emerges as eligible to be known in that epic as the absolute best of all the Achaeans, by contrast with such rivals as Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Ajax. Similarly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, only Odysseus emerges as the absolute best, by contrast with the suitors of Penelope. So, in terms of both these two macro-epics, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, there can only be one hero who is truly ‘the best of the Achaeans’.</p>
