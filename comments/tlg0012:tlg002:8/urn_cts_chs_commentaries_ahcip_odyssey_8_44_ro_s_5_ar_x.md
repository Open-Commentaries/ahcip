<p>The &quot;speaking name&quot; (nomen loquens) of the singer, <em>Dēmódokos</em>, can be interpreted as meaning ‘one who is received [verb <em>dek(h)esthai</em>] by the community [<em>dēmos</em>]’, and, in the present context, the <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ that gives to the singer’s singing its reception is indicated at O.08.036: that community is the <em>dēmos</em> or ‘district’ of the kingdom ruled by Alkinoos the king. I translate <em>Dēmódokos</em> as ‘received <em>by</em> the community’, not just ‘received <em>in</em> the community’, because the noun <em>dēmos</em> implies an authority that is endowed with agency: the <em>dēmos</em> can perform a function, such as the reception of a song. We can see such agency at work in the use of the word <em>dāmos</em> (da-mo) in the Linear B tablet Ep 704 from Pylos: in the litigation that is described in that text, the <em>dāmos</em> literally speaks as one of the two parties engaged in the litigation over land-tenure: <em>dāmos de min phāsi … ekheen </em>(da-mo-de-mi-pa-si … e-ke-e) ‘but the <em>dāmos</em> says [<em>phāsi</em>] that she [= the priestess] has …’ (HR 75–76). </p>
