<p>The metaphor of ‘pouring all over’ someone in the act of embracing that someone, as expressed here by way of the verb <em>amphi-khu-</em>, is an extension of the metaphor of ‘dissolving’ while weeping, on which see the comment at O.08.522. When you are weeping, pouring out your tears from your eyes, it is as if your whole self were dissoving into tears, which can then ‘pour all over’ the beloved someone whom you are embracing. Further relevant comments at O.16.214 and especially at O.19.204–212.  </p>
