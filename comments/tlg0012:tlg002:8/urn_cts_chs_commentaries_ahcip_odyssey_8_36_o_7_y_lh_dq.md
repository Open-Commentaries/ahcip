<p>Here the entire kingdom of the Phaeacians is figured as one single <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’. On <em>dēmos</em> as ‘community, district’, see the comments on O.01.103 and O.02.032, with cross-references there; and see also the comment on I.18.497–508, with reference to a scene of litigation in the context of a <em>dēmos</em> ‘district’ (δήμῳ at I.18.500), which is parallel to a litigation recorded in the Linear B tablet Ep 704 from Pylos, again in the context of a <em>dāmos</em> (da-mo) ‘district’ (HR 75–76). </p>
