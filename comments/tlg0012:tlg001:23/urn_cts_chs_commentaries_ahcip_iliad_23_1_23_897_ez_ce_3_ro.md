<p>The funeral that Achilles arranges here for Patroklos in the <em>Iliad</em> is in some ways a preview of the funeral that the Achaeans will arrange for Achilles himself beyond the time-frame of the <em>Iliad</em>. A high point of the funeral in <em>Iliad</em> 23 is a spectacular chariot race arranged by Achilles to honor his dead comrade Patroklos. But an earlier high point is a comparably spectacular cremation of his friendâ€™s body. But this cremation of Patroklos, as a ritual, is far from perfect: it is in fact polluted, and the pollution will make Achilles look bad, at least for the moment. The polluted thoughts of the hero, as evidenced by his dragging the corpse of Hector behind his speeding chariot, will drive him to extremes that will challenge the cosmic order. But the Master Narrator of the <em>Iliad</em> will remedy the pollution, and the remedy will take the form of actually narrating the grim story. In the process of this narration, a great lesson will be learned about life, death, and a hoped-for recovery of life. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/32_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_189_x_383_mm_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Achilles dragging the body of Hector.
