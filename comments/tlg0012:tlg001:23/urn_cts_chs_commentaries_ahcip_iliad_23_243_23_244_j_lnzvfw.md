<p>reference to the mixing of the ashes of Achilles and Patroklos in O.24.077 as not a duplication of references to the same mixing in the Iliad (here and 23.091-092), therefore not violating Munroâ€™s law, in the context of analyzing a traditional suppression of anything overtly Iliadic in the Odyssey</p>
