<p>The word <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ here at I.23.047, indicative of lament, is embedded in the actual words of lamentation performed by Achilles at I.23.043–053. The grief that Achilles feels for Patroklos, he says, will never go away: Achilles is now <em>a man of constant sorrow</em>. See especially the comment on I.18.015–073; also the comment on I.09.249–250.  </p>
