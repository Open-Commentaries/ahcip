<p>An <em>agōn</em>, as here at I.23.258, is literally a ‘coming together’ for competition; so, by extension, the word comes to mean ‘competition’. For more on the meaning and the etymology, see <em>The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours </em>(<em>H24H</em>), 21§1. Here at I.23.257–258 is where the so-called Funeral Games for Patroklos will commence. And they will end at I.24.001. See the comment on that verse. The ritual practice of athletic competition as a compensation for death is amply attested in Greek tradtions: see <em>H24H</em> 8a §§1–14. Here at I.23.258 the <em>agōn</em> can now begin to compensate for the death of Patroklos.</p>
