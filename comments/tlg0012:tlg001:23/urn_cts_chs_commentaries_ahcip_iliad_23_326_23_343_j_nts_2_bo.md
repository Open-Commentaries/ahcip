And it hasn’t rotted away from the rains. |329 There are two white rocks propped against either side of it. |330 There it is, standing at a point where two roadways meet, and it has a smooth track on both sides of it for driving a chariot. |331 It is either the tomb [<em>sēma</em>] of some mortal who died a long time ago |332 or was a turning point [<em>nussa</em>] in the times of earlier men. |333 Now swift-footed radiant Achilles has set it up as a turning point [<em>terma</em> plural]. |334 Get as close to it as you can when you drive your chariot horses toward it, |335 and keep leaning toward one side as you stand on the platform of your well-built chariot, |336 leaning to the left as you drive your horses. Your right-side horse |337 you must goad, calling out to it, and give that horse some slack as you hold its reins, |338 while you make your left-side horse get as close as possible [to the turning point], |339 so that the hub will seem to be almost grazing the post |340 - the hub of your well-made chariot wheel. But be careful not to touch the stone [of the turning point], |341 or else you will get your horses hurt badly and break your chariot in pieces. |342 That would make other people happy, but for you it would be a shame, |343 yes it would. So, near and dear [<em>philos</em>] as you are to me, you must be sound in your thinking and be careful. </p><p>(Epitomized from H24H 7§§3–6.) I concentrate here on the use of the word <em>sēma</em> in two verses, I.23.326 and I.23.331, concerning the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor to his son, the hero Antilokhos, about the <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ of an unnamed hero. I divide my analysis into four parts:</p><p>Part 1.</p><p>The two verses come from a passage where Nestor gives instructions to Antilokhos about the driving skills required for a charioteer to make a left turn around a landmark. As we will now learn from the context, this landmark is meant to be used as a turning point in the course of a chariot race that is being planned as the culminating athletic event of the Funeral Games for Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23. In the words of Nestor, this landmark is either a <em>sēma</em>, ‘tomb’, of an unnamed hero of the distant past, I.23.331, or it was once upon a time a ‘turning point’, a <em>nussa</em>, I.23.332, used for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. As I will argue, the master narrative of the <em>Iliad</em> shows that this <em>sēma</em> or ‘tomb’ is to be understood as the tomb of Patroklos himself, which he will share with Achilles once Achilles too is dead. To understand this is to understand the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ given by the hero Nestor.</p><p>Part 2.</p><p>The <em>sēma</em> that is the ‘tomb’ of the unnamed hero at I.23.331 is also a ‘sign’ of that hero’s cult, as signaled by the <em>sēma</em> or ‘sign’ that is conveyed by the speaker at I.23.326. That is what I once argued in an essay entitled “<em>Sēma</em> and <em>Noēsis</em>: The Hero’s Tomb and the ‘Reading’ of Symbols in Homer and Hesiod” (<em>GM</em> 202-222). As I pointed out in that essay, we know from evidence external to Homeric poetry that the tomb of a cult hero could be used as the actual turning point of a chariot race: in the historical period, starting with the adoption of chariot racing in the athletic program of the Olympics (this adoption has been dated at around 680 BCE), the turning-point of chariot-races could be conceptualized as the tomb of a hero, whose restless spirit was capable of “spooking” the horses at the most dangerous moment of the chariot-race, the left turn around the turning point. (GMP 215-216, with reference to Pausanias 6.20.15-19).</p><p>Part 3.</p><p>According to the wording of Nestor, however, there seem at first to be two different interpretations of the landmark that he is showing to Antilokhos: what is being visualized is either a tomb of a cult hero from the distant past or it is a turning point for chariot races that must have taken place in such a distant past. The landmark is an ambivalent sign. At least, it seems ambivalent, short range, on the basis of Nestor’s wording in this passage. Long range, however, on the basis of the overall plot of the <em>Iliad</em>, this wording will lead to a fusion of interpretations. And the sign that seemed at first to be ambivalent will become clear. Long range, the tomb of the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes the same landmark as the turning point of a chariot race from the distant past. That is because the unnamed hero from the distant past becomes a named hero from the immediate present of the <em>Iliad</em>. That hero is Patroklos, and he died just now, as it were, in <em>Iliad</em> 16. </p><p>Part 4</p><p>But Patroklos dies not only in the present time of the <em>Iliad</em>. He also did die a long time ago, from the standpoint of later generations who are listening to the story of the <em>Iliad</em>. So, the storytelling of the Iliad makes it possible for the athletic event of a chariot race from the distant past to become the same thing as the athletic event of a chariot race that is being held right now, in the same immediate present time of the story, in <em>Iliad</em> 23. And, as I argue, this race is intended to honor Patroklos as a once and future cult hero. See also the comment on O.11.119–137.  </p>
