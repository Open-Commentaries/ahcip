<p>The spirit of the dead Patroklos is recounting how Peleus had entrusted Patroklos as a <em>therapōn</em> to Achilles. On the adverb <em>endukéōs</em> ‘continuously, uninterruptedly’, see the anchor comment at O.07.256. Here the adverb may be highlighting an idea of continuity, linked with the ritual process of serving as a <em>therapōn</em>.  </p>
