<p>Meriones is consistently marked as the <em>therapōn</em> of Idomeneus, just as Patroklos is the <em>therapōn</em> of Achilles. Though Meriones as a <em>therapōn</em> of Idomeneus is a ritual substitute for that king of all the Cretans, this recessive member of the pair does not die for that dominant member. We see here a radical contrast with Patroklos, who does in fact die for Achilles. Meriones stays alive, destined to become a dominant hero in his own right. And a dress-rehearsal, as it were, for this status of eventual dominance is the role of Meriones as a competing chariot driver in the chariot race of <em>Iliad</em> 23. It is Meriones who competes in that race, not Idomeneus. </p>
