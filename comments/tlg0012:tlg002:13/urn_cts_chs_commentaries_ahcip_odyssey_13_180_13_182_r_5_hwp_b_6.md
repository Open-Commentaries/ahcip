<p>King Alkinoos here orders the Phaeacians to do two things without delay: to resolve never again to engage in the otherworldly <em>pompē</em> ‘conveying’ of mortals back to their real world, O.13.180, and to offer a sacrifice of twelve bulls to Poseidon, O.13.180–182. The Phaeacians must do these two things before the second of the two disasters should happen, which is, the blocking of their harbor by a huge mountain.   </p>
