<p>The goddess here formally declares to Odysseus her support for the hero, which leads ultimately to his success in his final confrontation with the suitors. But there is an undercurrent of antagonism between the goddess and the hero, insofar as they are both exponents of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’. Here it is Athena who boasts of her own poetic glory for possessing qualities of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, O.13.299.  </p>
