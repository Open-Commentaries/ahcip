<p>The mention of <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ here at O.13.023 takes us all the way back to the <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ that is planned by king Alkinoos for his guest back at O.08.038. See the comments at O.08.059–061 and at O.08.061. The <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ is eventually rethought as a stylized festival, centering on a sacrifice that leads to a division of meat at the feast. Such a festival continues from <em>Odyssey</em> 8 all the way to here, at the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 13.  </p>
