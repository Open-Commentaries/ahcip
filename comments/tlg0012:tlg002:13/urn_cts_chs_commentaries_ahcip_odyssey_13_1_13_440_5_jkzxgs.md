<p>The storytelling of Odysseus has come to an end, and he will now be sent home to Ithaca by his hosts, Alkinoos and the Phaeacians. Sailing through the night in a ship provided by king Alkinoos, Odysseus is in a deep sleep, which is compared to death itself. At the precise moment when the ship reaches the shores of his homeland, Ithaca, Odysseus will ‘come to’, experiencing a mystical return to light and life.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/T11208_10_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Ulysses Asleep Laid on his Own Coast by the Phaeacian Sailors” (1805).
