<p>The sacrificing of an ox to Zeus here marks this god as the ultimate hymnic subject of the festive performances starting with the three songs of Demodokos in <em>Odyssey</em> 8 and capped by the narrative of Odysseus himself in <em>Odyssey</em> 9–12. As we see most clearly in the <em>Homeric Hymns</em>, the invoked divinity who presides over a given festival is the hymnic subject of the hymn (MoM 4§82). We know from Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 2.1–3 that Zeus was the hymnic subject of the <em>Homēridai</em>, notional descendants of Homer, who performed the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> in relay (HPC 240, MoM 4§§99.4, 99.5). Accordingly, I interpret the sacrifice to Zeus here at O.13.024–025 as a signature, as it were, of the <em>Homēridai</em>. See also the comment that introduces Rhapsody 9.  </p>
