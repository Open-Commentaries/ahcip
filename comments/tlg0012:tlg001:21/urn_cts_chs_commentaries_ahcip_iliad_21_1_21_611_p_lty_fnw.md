<p>The momentum of Achilles continues to heat up. The Trojans are now retreating as fast as they can, heading back toward Troy to find safety there within the sacred walls of that ancient citadel. In their hurry to get away from the field of battle, their hasty retreat has quickly turned into a chaotic and humiliating rout. Achilles is right behind them, in hot pursuit, slaughtering left and right the fleeing Trojans. The hero seems unstoppable. But Achilles meets his match when he provokes the river god Scamander, whose clear streams he has polluted with the gore of countless Trojans that he slaughters while they are desperately attempting to ford the godâ€™s river. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/29_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman. <br/><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:(29)_Flaxman_Ilias_1793,_gestochen_1795,_185_x_275.jpg">Image</a> via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
