<p>The main preoccupation of the Achaeans here in <em>Iliad</em> 17 is to recover the corpse of Patroklos. Their efforts are understandable, in that they are showing their sense of solidarity by trying to rescue from harm the body of a fellow warrior who has fallen in battle. But the motivation here goes deeper. Patroklos is a cult hero in the making, and the corpses of heroes are essential for establishing hero cults in their honor. And the foreseen status of Patroklos as cult hero prefigures a comparable status for Achilles himself beyond the <em>Iliad</em>. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/22_Piroli_Flaxman_Ilias_1795_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:(22)_Flaxman_Ilias_1795,_Zeichnung_1793,_188_x_344_mm.jpg">Copperplate etching (1795) by Tommaso Piroli, after a drawing (1793) by John Flaxman</a><a>.</a>Photographed/scanned by H.-P.Haack (Antiquariat Dr. Haack Leipzig) [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
