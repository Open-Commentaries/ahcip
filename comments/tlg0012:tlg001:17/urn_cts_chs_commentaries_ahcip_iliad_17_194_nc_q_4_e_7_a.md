<p>The armor of Achilles, which had covered the body of Patroklos and which is now about to cover the body of Hector, is not just ‘immortal’: it is ‘immortalizing’. It will make you immortal unless it stops covering you, as when this armor falls off the body of Patroklos in the course of his death scene as narrated in <em>Iliad</em> 16. On the semantics of <em>ambroto</em>- as ‘immortalizing’, see the comment on I.16.670.  </p>
