<p>In this retrospective, it is said that Patroklos has been killed as a <em>therapōn</em> of Achilles, who is described here as ‘best of the Achaeans’. The immediate context accommodates here even the deeper meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’, since Patroklos himself could become temporarily the ‘best of the Achaeans’ at the moment of his death. At that moment, he is substituting himself for Achilles by prefiguring a future moment, beyond the <em>Iliad</em>, when Achilles will die in a way that matches the way that Patroklos died in <em>Iliad</em> 16.</p>
