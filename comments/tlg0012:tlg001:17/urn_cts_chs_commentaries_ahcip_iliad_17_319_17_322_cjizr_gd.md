<p>Here the Achaeans almost win the Trojan War. But that would be premature. In terms of the ordained narrative, such an event of winning would be ‘in-disaccord-with [<em>huper</em>] the portion [<em>aisa</em>] of Zeus’ (ὑπὲρ Διὸς αἶσαν), I.17.321. That is, the <em>aisa</em> or ‘apportionment’ of victory or defeat to the Achaeans and to the Trojans by Zeus is up to Zeus. Zeus gets to decide according to the plan of Zeus. And that plan cannot be contradicted, since the plot of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> must be the Will of Zeus. For more on the expression <em>huper aisan</em> ‘in disaccord with <em>aisa</em>’ (ὑπὲρ αἶσαν), see the comment on I.03.059. And, since the victory of the Achaeans depends on the Will of Zeus, the very idea that the Achaeans could win ‘by way of their own winning-power [<em>kratos</em>]’ (κάρτεϊ καὶ σθένεϊ σφετέρῳ)—such an idea is entertained at I.17.322—is an impossibility, since <em>kratos</em> ‘winning-power’ comes from the gods in the logic of Homeric diction. On this logic, see the comments on I.01.509 and I.11.317–319. </p>
