<p>The heat of battle is being compared here to the fire of lightning, I.17.737, in a thunderstorm that ravages the habitations of humankind with its <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’ amidst the īs ‘force, violence, strength’ of a storm wind, I.17.739. For the special significance of this powerful word <em>selas</em> ‘flash of light’, see the comment on I.19.003–017.  </p>
