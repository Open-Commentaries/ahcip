<p>The death of Patroklos is viewed here retrospectively as a great <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’, I.17.099, that is sure to <em>kulindesthai</em> ‘roll’ down from the heights like some boulder and destroy anyone daring to attack a warrior who is being protected by a god. On the metaphor of such a <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ as a boulder that ‘rolls’ down from the heights, see the comment on I.11.347. In the present context, I.17.098–101, the <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ has descended upon Patroklos, who has dared to attack Hector while that warrior was being protected by Apollo. This <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ for Patroklos prefigures what will happen to Achilles himself beyond the <em>Iliad</em> when he dares to attack Paris while that warrior is in turn being protected by Apollo.  </p>
