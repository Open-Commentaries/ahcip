<p>The hero Euphorbos, fighting on the Trojan side of the war, has just been killed by Menelaos the Achaean. The corpse of Euphorbos is described here as a generic <em>beau mort</em>, that is, as a dead body made beautiful by way of a beautiful death, <em>une belle mort</em>. (See the anchor comment on I.123.184–191 on the salvation of Hector’s body, with reference to Hector as the definitive <em>beau mort</em> of the <em>Iliad</em>.) There are two levels to be seen in the overall wording that describes the corpse of Euphorbos here. First, at I.17.050–051, the beauty of the body is indicated incidentally by way of focusing on a detailed description of the dead hero’s hair. Second, at I.17.53–60, the entire body of the dead hero is compared, by way of simile, to a tender young olive seedling or ernos that has just been uprooted by a violent gust of wind.</p>
