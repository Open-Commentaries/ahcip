<p>Apollo, disguised as a Trojan, is claiming that Zeus still ‘wishes’, as expressed by the verb <em>bouletai</em> at I.17.331, to give <em>nīkē</em> ‘victory’ to the Trojans instead of the Achaeans, I.17.332. On the basis of what is humanly perceivable by the Trojan whom the god is impersonating here, this claim is still true, but the truth of the claim is not to last.  </p>
