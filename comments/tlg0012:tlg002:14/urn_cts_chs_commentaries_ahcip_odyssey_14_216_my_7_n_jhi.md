<p>(What follows is epitomized from HPC 289–290, where I offer supplementary bibliography.) A comparable pairing of Ares and Athena as divinities of war is found at I.18.515–519. See the comments on those lines. As I noted already in those comments, such a pairing of Ares and Athena is so old as to be traceable all the way back to the Bronze Age. Here I offer some details. As we know from the documentary evidence of the Linear B tablets found in the palace of Knossos in Crete, the divinities Athena and Ares (in that order) are paired as symmetrical recipients of offerings: in one tablet, V 52, a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja is listed together with e-nu-wa-ri-jo and pa-ja-wo-ne and po-se-da-o-ne. I interpret these syllabic spellings as follows: a-ta-na-po-ti-ni-ja = <em>Athānāi potniāi</em> or perhaps <em>Athānās potniā </em>(see the comment on O.07.078–081), e-nu-wa-ri-jo = <em>Enūaliōi</em>, pa-ja-wo-ne = <em>Paiāwonei</em>, po-se-da-o-ne = <em>Poseidāonei</em>. As we know from the evidence of Homeric diction, the divine name <em>Enūalios</em> became an epithet of Ares, as we see for example at I.18.211. In some Homeric contexts, as at I.20.069, <em>Enūalios</em> is a god in his own right, distinct from Ares, just as <em>Paiāwōn</em> (Homeric <em>Paiēōn</em>) is in some contexts distinct from Apollo, as at I.05.401, I.05.899–900. As for the name of Ares, it too is attested in the Linear B tablets, Knossos Fp 14 and Fp 5816, in the form a-re = <em>Arei</em>. The Cretan connection of Athena and Ares is attested here at O.14.216 as well, where Odysseus in the second of his “Cretan lies” represents himself as a Cretan prince who professes his devotion to these two divinities in moments of crisis in battle. I should add that the pairing of Ares and Athena in the world of images represented on the Shield of Achilles is expressed by way of bronzework that is overlaid with gold, I.18.517–519. Such a technique of metalwork, as narrated on the Shield, is notionally linked to the heroic age or, as archaeologists would say it, to the Bronze Age.</p>
