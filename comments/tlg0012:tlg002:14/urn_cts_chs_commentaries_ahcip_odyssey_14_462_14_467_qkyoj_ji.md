<p>|462 κέκλυθι νῦν, Εὔμαιε καὶ ἄλλοι πάντες ἑταῖροι, |463 εὐξάμενός τι ἔπος ἐρέω· οἶνος γὰρ ἀνώγει, |464 ἠλεός, ὅς τ’ ἐφέηκε πολύφρονά περ μάλ&#x27; ἀεῖσαι |465 καί θ’ ἁπαλὸν γελάσαι καί τ&#x27; ὀρχήσασθαι ἀνῆκε, |466 καί τι ἔπος προέηκεν, ὅ πέρ τ&#x27; ἄρρητον ἄμεινον. |467 ἀλλ&#x27; ἐπεὶ οὖν τὸ πρῶτον ἀνέκραγον, οὐκ ἐπικεύσω. </p><p>|462 Listen to me now, Eumaios and all you other companions! |463 Speaking proudly [<em>eukhesthai</em>], I will tell you an utterance. The wine is telling me to do so. |464 Wine, distracting as it is, impels even the thinking man to sing |465 and to laugh softly. And it urges him on to dance. |466 It even prompts an utterance that may be better left unsaid. |467 But now that I have shouted out loud [<em>anakrazein</em>], I will not suppress it.</p><p>The wording here, as delivered by the disguised Odysseus to Eumaios, is cognate with the poeticized replication of a festive occasion in the words of Pindar, <em>Nemean</em> 7.75–76:</p><p>ἔα με· νικῶντί γε χάριν, εἴ τι πέραν ἀερθείς | ἀνέκραγον, οὐ τραχύς εἰμι καταθέμεν. </p><p>Your indulgence, please! If I—to reciprocate the victor—shouted something out loud [<em>anakrazein</em>] as I soared too far up, I am not unversed in bringing it back down. </p>
