<p>Eumaios compliments the discourse of Odysseus, calling it a fine example of an <em>ainos</em>. Here the meaning of <em>ainos</em> can be interpreted in a general poetic sense, as &#x27;coded words&#x27;-a ‘coded message’. But there is also a specific poetic sense that is conveyed by the same word: an <em>ainos</em> can be festive, highlighting the merriment of song and dance. The same kind of festivity is formalized also in the victory odes of Pindar, where the medium of the odes can refer to itself by way of the same word, ainos, as we see for example in the case of <em>Olympian</em> 11.7. See also the general comment on O.09.003–011 and the specific comment there on the word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’ at O.09.006. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer again here to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198).  </p>
