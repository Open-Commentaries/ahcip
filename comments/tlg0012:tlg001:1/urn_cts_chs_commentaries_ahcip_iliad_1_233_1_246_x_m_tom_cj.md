<p>Achilles swears by the <em>skēptron</em> ‘scepter’ that he holds and then throws down to the ground. This oath of Achilles is correlated with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, starting from a point in time when Achilles declares his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ all the way to the point in time when he un-declares or unsays it.  </p>
