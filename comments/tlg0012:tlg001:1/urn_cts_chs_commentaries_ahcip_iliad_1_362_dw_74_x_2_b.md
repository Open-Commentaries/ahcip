<p>The word <em>penthos</em> is used here to indicate the ‘grief’ of Achilles. Both words <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ and <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ refer to the emotion felt by Achilles over the damage done to his <em>tīmē</em> by Agamemnon when the over-king insults him. In general, <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is a synonym of <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ in Homeric diction. </p>
