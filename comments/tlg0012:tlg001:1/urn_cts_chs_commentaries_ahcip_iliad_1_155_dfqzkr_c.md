<p>The traditional epithet for Phthie, the homeland of Achilles, is <em>bōti-aneira</em> ‘she who nourishes men’. There is a paradox built into this noun+epithet combination, since the name <em>Phthiē</em> is associated with the idea of ‘wilting’, as conveyed by the verb <em>phthinesthai</em> ‘wilt, perish’. See also the comments on I.19.322–323 and I.19.329–330, I.19.337.  </p>
