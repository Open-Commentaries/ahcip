<p>By saying ‘sing, goddess [<em>theā</em>]’, the Master Narrator is saying that the song that he will perform is something that he hears from the Muse. The addressing of the Muse as <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’ is an Aeolian signature, as it were, since the form <em>theā</em> is Aeolic, as opposed to the form <em>(hē) theos</em>, which is Ionic. See the anchor comment at I.01.463 on Aeolians as speakers of Aeolic, vs. Ionians as speakers of Ionic. </p>
