<p>The main theme of the narration is signaled right away. The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. The word is <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, I.01.001, and it refers to the anger of Achilles. A definitive book on this word is Muellner 1996. The Master Narrator begins his narration by focusing on this anger: he calls on a Muse, whom he addresses simply as <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’, to sing this anger, I.01.001. The subject of this narration, the anger of Achilles, is the grammatical object of the verb aeidein ‘sing’. So, the <em>narrative subject</em> is the <em>grammatical object</em>. The Master Narrator is calling on the Muse to sing the anger, not just sing about the anger. The song is not only about the anger: it is the anger itself. The song captures the total reality of the anger. The Master Narrator proceeds to tell about this anger: it happened because of a quarrel, as signaled especially by the words <em>erizein</em> ‘have strife’ at I.01.006 and <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at I.01.008. This quarrel in the <em>Iliad</em> is parallel to another quarrel that is narrated in a “micro-Iliad” that we find embedded in the <em>Odyssey</em>. This micro-Iliad is the First Song of Demodokos, O<em>.</em>08.072–083, and the quarrel there is signaled especially by the word <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ at O.08.075. It has been debated whether the quarrel scene in this “micro-Iliad” was modeled on a quarrel-scene in the <em>Cypria</em>, which was part of the epic Cycle. On the <em>epic Cycle</em>, see the Inventory of terms and names. But the quarrel scenes of the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>Cypria</em>, and the “micro-Iliad” can be seen as stemming from epic traditions that were originally independent of each other. On the term <em>epic</em>, used here for the first time in these comments on the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, see again the Inventory of terms and names.  </p>
