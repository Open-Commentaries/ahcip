<p>  </p><p>The comments I offered in Classical Inquiries 2016-2017 on <em>Iliad</em> Rhapsody 1 through Rhapsody 24, starting here with Rhapsody 1, were based mostly on details that derive from seven books that I indicate in the Bibliography by way of these abbreviations: BA, GMP, H24H, HC, HPC, HQ, HR, MoM, PasP, PH. Each one of these books has its own <em>index locorum</em>. My colleague Anita Nikkanen, an Associate Editor for the online project <em>A Homer commentary in progress</em>, tracked the sequences of Homeric verses as listed in the indices for six of these books and then summarized my comments on those verses. Following up on her meticulous work, I am in the process of converting her summaries into a form of commentary that is being incorporated into <em>AHCIP</em>. My comments on the <em>Iliad</em> as I presented them in <em>Classical Inquiries</em> 2016-2017 are merely samplings of the content that I hope to contribute to the overall commentary, to which a number of other colleagues are also contributing their own comments. That said, I now proceed to offer a sampling of comments on Rhapsody 1. At this point, my comments about this beginning of beginnings need no further introduction of their own. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The_Rage_of_Achilles_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo-2.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“The Rage of Achilles,” by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, 1757, [public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.</p>
