<p>We see here in the <em>Iliad</em> the first occurrence of the epithet <em>rhododaktulos</em> ‘rosy-fingered’, applied to Ēōs, goddess of the dawn. This epithet can be explained as a substitution for another epithet, <em>thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, which is applied to other goddesses, most notably to Aphrodite: see the anchor comment at I.03.374.  </p>
