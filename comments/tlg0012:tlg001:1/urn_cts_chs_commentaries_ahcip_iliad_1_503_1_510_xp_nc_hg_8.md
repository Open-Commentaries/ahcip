<p>In the words of the immortal goddess Thetis, speaking to the all-powerful god Zeus on behalf of her mortal son Achilles, the status of this hero as ‘best of the Achaeans’ is linked with the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that he experiences over the damage to his <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’. The mother is here reframing the words of her son, spoken earlier at I.01.407–412. The <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of Achilles leads to his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, which in turn will lead to the collective <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of all the Achaeans, and it will be enacted by the Will of Zeus, who is the father that Achilles never had. And the Will of Zeus will be enhanced by the <em>mētis</em> ‘intelligence’ of Thetis, whom Zeus never got a chance to impregnate.  </p>
