<p>In the words of the mortal hero Achilles, speaking to his immortal mother Thetis, the status of the hero as ‘best of the Achaeans’ is linked with the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that he experiences over the damage to his <em>tīmē</em>—damage caused by the insult inflicted by Agammemnon in the quarrel between the two heroes. The <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of Achilles leads to his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, which in turn will lead to the collective <em>akhos</em> of all the Achaeans. The <em>horkos</em> ‘oath’ of Achilles, Ι.01.233, which he will swear by as he holds the <em>skēptron</em> ‘scepter’, I.01.234, and which he then throws to the ground to mark his oath, is coextensive with the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that the Achaeans will suffer because of the hero’s <em>mēnis</em>. [[cross-ref. I.01.233–246]] To the extent that the Oath of Achilles is sacred, so too is the coextensive plot of the <em>Iliad</em>. This plot or narrative arc, leading to devastation for the Achaeans, will be enhanced by the <em>mētis</em> or ‘intelligence’ of Thetis, immortal mother of Achilles; and it will be enacted by the Will of Zeus. </p>
