<p>The Will of Zeus, which is made coextensive with the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, is formalized by the all-powerful god when he nods his head, as he does here at I.01.524–530. When Zeus nods his head here to signal what is called the Will of Zeus, which is the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>, his plan is to make the story of the <em>Iliad</em> happen. That is the Plan of Zeus, not only the Will of Zeus. Likewise coextensive with the plot of the <em>Iliad</em> is the Oath of Achilles, retold at I.01.233–246, where Achilles formalizes his speech-act when he throws to the ground the scepter by which he swore when he spoke his Oath. </p>
