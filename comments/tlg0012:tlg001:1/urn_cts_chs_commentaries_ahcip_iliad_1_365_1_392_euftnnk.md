<p>The theme expressed by the verb <em>daiesthai</em> ‘feast: divide (meat), apportion, distribute’ at I.01.368 is at work in the Strife Scene at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>—although a ‘feast’ as expressed by the noun <em>dais</em> is not literally the setting. Still, the grievance of Achilles has to do with his being deprived of his equitable portion of the spoils of war.  </p>
