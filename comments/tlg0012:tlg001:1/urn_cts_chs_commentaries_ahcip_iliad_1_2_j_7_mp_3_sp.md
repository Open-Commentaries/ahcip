<p>The reference to <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ here is relevant to the etymology of the name <em>Akhil(l)eus—</em>if this name can successfully be explained as a shortened by-form of <em>*Akhi-lāu̯os</em> in the sense of ‘he who has the grief [<em>akhos</em>] of the people [<em>lāu̯os</em>]’. In comments to come, the word <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’, will be traced as a marker for a most pervasive theme in the <em>Iliad</em>: how the anger of Achilles caused grief for his people. </p>
