<p>This line is a multiform of the regular formula for concluding prayers that are labelled with the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, which is a word that designates three different kinds of discourse by using mutually exclusive formulas for each of the three. It has a two-part structure extending  from the line-beginning to the oblgatory word-break within the third foot and from the obligatory word-break to the end of the line. The first chunk, <em>hōs ephat'/ephan eukhomenos/ē/oi/ai</em>, whose subject is always a previously identified mortal or mortals, designates that the discourse that precedes the line was a prayer and is concluded, and the second chunk, <em>tou d' eklue</em> |¯˘˘ | ¯˘#, designates that the divinity addressed, whose name + epithet combination is specified in the space at the end of the line, 'heard' (<em>eklue</em>, cognate with the English word '(k)listen') the prayer (for Poseidon, just the epithet <em>kuanokhaitēs 'with a glossy blue mane' occurs</em>, since his name + epithet combinations are too long to fit the metrical space) . 'Heard' is functionally unmarked in English, but in only one of the 25 occurrences of this formulaic line does it mean anything less than accepted and agreed: at <em>Iliad</em> 16.250, where Zeus accepts one part of Achilles' request about Patroklos and refuses (the verb is <em>aneneue</em> 'was refusing') the other. When the response to the prayer is (exceptionally) negative, the expression <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> 'and he/she heard him/her' is replaced with <em>aneneue de + </em>name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 6.311) 'and she was refusing'  or <em>nemesēse de</em> + name + epithet (once, <em>Iliad</em> 8.198) 'and she was outraged'. There are also two places where <em>tou/tēs d' eklue</em> is replaced with different verbs and divine names to express an exceptionally <em>positive</em> response on the part of the divinity (<em>Odyssey</em> 2.267 and <em>Iliad</em> 15.377). There are also two attestations when the beginning of this line, <em>hōs ephat' eukhomenos, </em>is attested in a non-sacral context that evokes one of the other meanings of the verb <em>eukhomai</em>, 'boast (of warriors in battle)'; see <em>Iliad</em> 5.106 and <em>Iliad</em> 20.393, but in both those cases (and in no others) good medieval manuscripts attest a metrically equivalent variant <i>hōs phat' <strong>ep</strong>eukhomenos </i>which is actually attested in the meaning 'boast' without variants in <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 370; so it is clear that just the first half of this formulaic line is, despite a plausible ambiguity, traditionally associated with the meaning 'pray' in sacral contexts.</p><p>In short, this line is a manifestation of a superbly efficient and expressive system for concluding a prayer. </p>
