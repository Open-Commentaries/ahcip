<p>This insult directed at Agamemnon by Achilles exemplifies the language of blame. Another aspect of the blame here is the double meaning of <em>dēmo</em>- in the compound formation <em>dēmoboros</em>: it could refer either to <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ or to <em>dēmós</em> ‘fat, grease’. Metaphorically, Agamemnon is a ‘devourer of the community’ because he is like a predatory beast that devours the fat of his prey.  </p>
