<p>This line marks the first appearance of the word <em>mûthos</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>. Here Agamemnon addresses Chryses; he κρατερὸν δ᾽ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε. Often this word is translated simply as <em>word</em> or <em>speech</em>. However, it is apparent in this line that <em>mûthos</em> is not just a speech but also an act that displays authority. On the one hand, <em>mûthos</em> is a performance of Agamemnon’s power over Chryses. On the other, it is a performance before the troops intended to persuade the audience that his action is appropriate. In general, the word <em>mûthos</em> is best understood as a speech-act which is performed in order to augment, diminish, or negotiate the status and power of speakers in the <em>Iliad</em>. In the <em>Iliad</em> all<em> muthoi</em> are performed at length, usually in public, and comprise a range of speech-genres. However, all but 12 of the 167 occurrences of the stem <span style="font-style: normal !msorm;"><em>muth</em></span>- (noun and verb forms) in the <em>Iliad</em> can also be categorized as marking proposals and commands or threats and boasts. These discourses can be further categorized into three genres:</p>
<ol>
<li>Commands (See Zeus’s command via Iris at <em>Iliad</em> 8.399-408)</li>
<li>Boast-and-insult contests (see Agamemnon’s <em>epipolesis </em>in <em>Iliad</em> 4)</li>
<li>The recitation of remembered events (see Nestor at <em>Iliad</em> 1.259-274)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus each hero in the <em>Iliad</em> is a performer who utilizes these genres in order to compete within Homeric society. <em>mûthos</em> then is an authoritative self-presentation of the speaker to the audience which can be directly contrasted with the Homeric word <em>epos</em>: a short utterance that accompanies but does not constitute performance.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Homeric poetry itself can be understood as <em>mûthos</em>. It is “poetry meant to persuade, enacted in public, created by authority, in a context where authority is always up for grabs and to be won by the speaker with the best style” (Martin 1993:238).</p>
