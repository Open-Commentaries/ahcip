<p>The theme of <em>le morceau du héros</em>, which is the ‘champion’s portion’ of meat awarded to a dominant hero, is coextensive with the theme of a hero’s epic ‘destiny’, one word for which is <em>aisa</em>, as here. Literally, such a ‘destiny’ is the hero’s ‘portion’ or ‘allotment’. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the focus is on the destiny of this epic’s most dominant hero, Achilles.  </p>
