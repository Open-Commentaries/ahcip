<p>The <em>mēnis</em> of Achilles is a special kind of ‘anger’. The hero feels this anger after his <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ is damaged by the over-king Agamemnon. The Master Narrator says at verse 2 here that this special anger caused <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ for the Achaeans. The word <em>mēnis</em> does not yet refer to the anger of other persons in the narration. As the narration continues, however, it becomes clear that the god Apollo felt <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ at the Achaeans even before the hero Achilles felt his own <em>mēnis</em>.  </p>
