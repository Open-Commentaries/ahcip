<p>The Will of Zeus is presented here as the plot of the narration or narrative arc that we know as the <em>Iliad</em>. The Greek noun <em>boulē</em>, translated here as ‘Will’, is what the god ‘wishes’, as expressed by the verb <em>boulesthai</em> ‘wish’. For <em>boulesthai</em> ‘wish’, see the comment on I.11.078–079. But the noun <em>boulē</em> conveys also the idea of ‘planning’, not just ‘wishing’: when Zeus wishes to do something, he engages in planning what he wishes, so that the Will of Zeus is also the Plan of Zeus. See the comment on I.01.524–530 concerning the Plan of Zeus. In comments still to come, there will be further observations on the Will of Zeus with reference to other relevant words, including <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’, <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, <em>mūthos</em> ‘wording’.</p>
