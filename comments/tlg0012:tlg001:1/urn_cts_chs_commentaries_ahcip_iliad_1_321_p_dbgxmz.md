<p>This is the first occurrence of the noun <em>therapōn</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>; the dual form here is <em>theraponte</em>. In the immediate context, only the surface meaning, ‘attendant’, is evident. In other contexts, as at I.04.227, there are traces of a deeper meaning, ‘ritual substitute’.  </p>
