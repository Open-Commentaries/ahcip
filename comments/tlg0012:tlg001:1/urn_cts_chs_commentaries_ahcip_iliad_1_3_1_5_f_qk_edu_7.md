<p>In the <em>Iliad</em>, the word <em>autos</em> ‘self’ refers to the body as the basis of identity for heroes, while the word <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ refers to (A) the <em>life-force</em> of heroes when they are alive and (B) the <em>disembodied conveyor of identity</em> when they are dead. Here at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, the dead body of the generic hero is identified with the ‘self’, <em>autos</em>. When a warrior dies in the <em>Iliad</em>, his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ goes to the realm of Hādēs while his body, which is his ‘self’, is left behind and must be treated with proper ritual care. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the ritually correct treatment of a warrior’s dead body, which is called <em>sōma</em>, is cremation. See I.22.342–343 and the comment on I.22.335–354. The very idea of exposing a dead body to be devoured by dogs and birds is considered to be an abomination in the <em>Iliad</em>, as in the verses here at I.01.3–5, by contrast with the ritually correct practice of cremation. See the comment on I.22.335–354. There is also a cross-cultural contrast to be noted here: the practice of exposing a dead body to be eaten by dogs and birds is considered to be ritually correct in Iranian traditions that uphold Zoroastrian orthodoxy, while the very idea of cremating a dead body is for Zoroastrians an abomination. Both practices, exposition and cremation, are linked with ideas of eschatology, that is, of a permanent kind of afterlife. In Zoroastrian traditions, such an afterlife is endangered by cremation, while in Homeric traditions the danger comes from exposition. There will be more to say about ideas of afterlife in the anchor comment at I.23.071–076, where it will be argued that Hādēs in Homeric poetry is merely a transitional phase of afterlife for the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of a hero who died: in other words, Hādēs is not eschatological. </p>
