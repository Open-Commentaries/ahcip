<p>The epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ here at I.01.002, which describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Iliad</em> as designated by the driving word <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ at I.01.001, is now immediately followed at I.01.002 by a relative clause that outlines the plot of this narration. Similarly, the epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327, which describes the poetic subject of a performed narration as designated by the driving word <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326, is then immediately followed at O.01.327 by a relative clause that outlines the plot of that narration. See the comment on O.01.326–327.  </p>
