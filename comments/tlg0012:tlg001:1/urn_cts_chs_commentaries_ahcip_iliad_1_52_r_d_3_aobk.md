<p>The adverb <em>aiei </em>‘forever’ is the old locative case of the noun aiōn ‘life-force, lifetime’. The use of the locative indicates that the ‘life-force’ keeps coming back to life by way of a ‘recircling of time’. So, <em>aiei</em> means literally ‘in a recircling of time’, signaling an eternal return, a perpetual starting-over.  </p>
