<p>Insulted by Agamemnon, Achilles experiences instantaneous <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’, I.01.188, which will then undergo a metastasis into <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’. As we will see in what follows, that anger will then cause <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ for the Achaeans as an aggregate, and that collective <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ will end only after Achilles unsays his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, as signaled finally at I.19.074–075. </p>
