<p>When the Olympian gods are away from their home situated on Mount Olympus, they customarily attend a dais ‘feast’, Ι.01.424, in the Land of the <em>Aithiopes</em> ‘Aethiopians’, Ι.01.423, whose home is situated at the two farthest imaginable extremities of the known world, that is, both in the Far East and in the Far West, on the banks of the world-encircling river named Ōkeanos, Ο.01.022–024. The idea that the Aethiopians live at both extremes of the world is an example of a theme that can best be described as a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. When the gods attend the stylized feast of the Aethiopians, as when Poseidon visits them at O.01.022–026, they cannot pay attention to the feasts arranged by mortals in the central world of the heroes’ here-and-now. Such feasts would be sacrifices, involving a <em>dais</em> or literally a ‘division’ of meat. The word <em>dais</em> means ‘feast’ because any occasion of feasting in the heroic world requires a ritualized ‘division’ of the cooked meat of animals sacrificed for the occasion. See the comment on O.08.061. The word dais does not distinguish between an occasion where gods and humans feast together, as in the case of marginal figures like the Aethiopians, and an occasion where humans offer sacrifice to the gods, as in the case of the central figures like the heroes in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. For an example of <em>dais</em> with reference to a feast shared by Poseidon with the Aethiopians, see O.01.026 and the comment on O.01.022–026. For an example of <em>dais</em> with reference to a feast resulting from a sacrifice of animals to the gods, see O.08.061.</p>
