<p>The action of Zeus in nodding his head to express his Will results in his making contact, by way of metonymy, with the emotions of Achilles. The effect of such divine metonymy in making contact with human emotions is seen by ancient critics as an attempt at familiarizing, personalizing, and even eroticizing the gods.  </p>
