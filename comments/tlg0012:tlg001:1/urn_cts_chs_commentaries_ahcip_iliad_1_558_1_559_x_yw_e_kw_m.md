<p>The reference here to the Will of Zeus, as recapitulated in the words of the goddess Hērā, repeats a main theme in the plot or narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>: the damaging of the <em>tīmē</em> ‘honor’ of Achilles by the Achaeans will lead to the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that they will experience at the Battle for the Ships, when their very survival will be threatened by the fire of Hector. What Achilles had wished for has by now become the Will of Zeus: the Achaeans will from now on keep losing until the fire of Hector reaches the ships.  </p>
