<p>The words spoken by Kalkhas the seer here at I.01.074–083 indicate three different kinds of anger: <em>mēnis</em> at I.01.075, <em>kholos</em> at I.01.081, and <em>kotos</em> at I.01.082. In the case of <em>mēnis</em>, it is a kind of “cosmic sanction”: I cite the definitive work of Muellner 1996, especially ch.1. As for <em>kholos</em>, it is a kind of explosive anger that is generally instantaneous, as opposed to <em>kotos</em>, which is an anger that is timed to go off only in the fullness of time, when the course of events in the narration has come to fulfillment, as expressed here at I.01.082 by way of the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘come to fulfillment’. On <em>kotos</em> in particular and on <em>kholos</em> in general, see Walsh 2013, especially ch. 1, where he analyzes the wording of the seer here at I.01.074–083 as a kind of “folk definition” for all three of the different kinds of anger mentioned in this passage. </p>
