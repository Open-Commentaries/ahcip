<p>There are two comparable situations in the <em>Iliad</em> where a <em>paiēōn</em> is sung to mark a major remedy for the Achaeans. In the present situation, the singing of such a song marks the cessation of <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ for the Achaeans. In another situation, I.22.391, it marks the winning of a mighty <em>kūdos</em> ‘sign of glory’ for the Achaeans, which is, the killing of Hector by Achilles: see the overall context of I.22.391–394. </p>
