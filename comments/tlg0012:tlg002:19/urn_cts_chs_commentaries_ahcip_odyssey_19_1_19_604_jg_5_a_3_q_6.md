<p>Rhapsody 19 is best known for a scene where Odysseus is recognized by his old nurse Eurykleia. She notices a tell-tale scar on his leg—the result of a wound that marks the moment in his youth when he was gored in a boar hunt. This scar can be seen as a <em>sēma </em>or ‘sign’ of the hero’s identity.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/T11214_10_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Euryclea Discovers Ulysses” (1805).
