<p>In Penelope’s dream as she reports it here at O.19.547, the talking eagle that dream-interprets itself to be really Odysseus says that this dream is not just any <em>onar</em> or ‘dream’ but rather, more than that, it is a <em>hupar esthlon </em>or ‘waking reality’ (οὐκ ὄναρ, ἀλλ&#x27; ὕπαρ ἐσθλόν). The reality that is being foretold in the dream here at O.19.547 is signaled by the word <em>hupar</em>, which refers to a dream that is seen when one is asleep but will also be seen after one is awake, as opposed to the word <em>onar</em> (also <em>oneiros</em>), which refers to a dream seen only in sleep. (The word <em>hupar</em> is cognate with the element <em>suppar</em>- of the Hittite verb <em>suppariya</em>- ‘sleep’: see DELG under ὕπαρ.) The reality foretold by a dream that is <em>hupar</em> is reinforced here at O.19.547 by the epithet <em>esthlon</em> ‘real, genuine, good’, which is derived from the root <em>es</em>- ‘to be’ as in <em>esti</em> ‘is’. The vision signaled by the <em>hupar esthlon</em> or ‘waking reality’, as I have translated it, will come to fulfillment, that is, <em>it will reach its real outcome</em>, as expressed by the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’. Imperfective uses of this verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ refer to realities that are still in the making, that have not yet come to fulfillment: see for example the comment at I.02.330. Perfective uses of this same word, on the other hand, refer to a reality that has come to fulfillment. Here at O.19.547, we see a future perfect use: the talking eagle of the dream is foretelling a reality that will have already happened when the right moment in the narrative finally arrives. This verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’, as used here at O.19.547, focuses on a central idea in contexts of composition-in-performance. The idea is this: whatever is being said in the performance will come to fulfillment in the composition when all is said and done.  </p>
