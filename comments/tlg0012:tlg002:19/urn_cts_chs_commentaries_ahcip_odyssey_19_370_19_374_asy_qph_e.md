<p>Here at O.19.370 and O.19.372 the objects of mockery as expressed by the verb <em>ephepsiaâsthai</em> ‘mock’ are not the unjust but the just, such as the disguised Odysseus and others like him who are despised as beggars. Once again, such mockery comes from blame poetry, but here the blame is injustifiable. The women who mock the disguised Odysseus are described at O.19.373 as engaging in <em>lōbē</em> ‘words of insult’ and <em>aiskhea</em> ‘disgraceful things’. Both these words point to unjustified forms of blame. On <em>lōbē</em> ‘words of insult’, see the comment at O.18.347. As for <em>aiskhea</em> ‘disgraceful things’, it is the concrete plural of the abstract singular <em>aiskhos</em>, which means ‘disgrace, shame’: see the comment on <em>aiskhos</em> at O.11.433.  </p>
