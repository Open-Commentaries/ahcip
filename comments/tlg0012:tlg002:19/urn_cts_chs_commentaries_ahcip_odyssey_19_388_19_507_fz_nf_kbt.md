<p>Eurykleia recognizes Odysseus when she is washing his feet. The sign for her recognition is the scar that she notices on his leg—a wound that marks the time when he went on a boar hunt to Parnassus with his mother’s father, Autolykos. The word that signals the recognition is <em>gignōskein</em> ‘recognize’ at O.19.392 and at O.19.468. The scar that Eurykleia recognizes here turns out to be a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ of the hero’s true identity, as we see from the use of that word at O.21.217 and at O.23.073. See the comments at O.21.217–224 and at O.23.073–077 respectively. This word <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ does not occur here at O.19.388–507, but the occurrences at O.21.217 and at O.23.073 indicate clearly that the scar as a <em>sēma</em> is a subtext, as it were, for the recognition scene that frames the narrative about the boar hunt at Parnassus.</p>
