<p>This expression <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em> ‘throughout humankind’ here at O.19.334 is conventionally associated with words referring to remembrance by way of song. In this case, the relevant word is <em>kleos</em>, O.19.333, referring to the ‘glory’ of poetry and song. See the anchor comment at I.10.213.  </p>
