<p>Here at O.19.178, I translate the pronoun <em>têisi</em> (τῇσι) as ‘in this land [plural]’. This pronoun, referring to the land of Crete, is in the plural, not in the the singular, as we might have expected. The explanation can be found in the comment at O.14.199, where we see <em>Krētē</em>, the name of Crete, not in the singular but in the plural, <em>Krêtai</em>. As I point out in that comment, plural <em>Krêtai</em> cannot mean a multiplicity of islands named Crete. There is no such thing. Rather, we see there an elliptic plural, meaning ‘Crete and everything that belongs to it’. And of course whatever belongs to Crete are all the Aegean islands and lands controlled by the thalassocracy of Crete. So also in the case of the pronoun τῇσι as ‘in this land [plural]’ at O.19.178, we see an elliptic plural referring to Crete together with everything that belongs to Crete. So, even the pronoun signals the imperial power of Crete.  </p>
