<p>There is a pattern of onomatopoeia built into the name Itylos = ´<em>Itulos</em>, as derivative of ´<em>Itus</em> (Ἴτυς), a name of the son of the unfortunate mythical woman who was turned into a nightingale. The doubling of this name produces a “tweeting” effect, as in Aeschylus <em>Agamemnon</em> 1144: Ἴτυν Ἴτυν στένουσ᾿ ‘[the nightingale] mourning “´<em>Itun</em> ´<em>Itun</em>”’; also Sophocles <em>Electra</em> 148: ἃ Ἴτυν αἰὲν Ἴτυν ὀλοφύρεται ‘who keeps on mourning “´<em>Itun</em> ´<em>Itun</em>”’. </p>
