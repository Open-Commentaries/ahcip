<p>Detoured by violent winds, the Odysseus of this Cretan Odyssey lands in Crete. The place where he lands is Amnisos, and a poetic landmark for this place is a cave of Eileithuia. As we know from the reportage of Strabo, who flourished in the first century BCE, Amnisos was reputed to be the sea harbor of Minos the king. Here is the precise wording of Strabo (10.4.8 C476): Μίνω δέ φασιν ἐπινείῳ χρήσασθαι τῷ Ἀμνισῷ, ὅπου τὸ τῆς Εἰλειθυίας ἱερόν ‘they say that Minos used Amnisos as his seaport, and the sacred-space [<em>hieron</em>] of Eileithuia is there’. According to Pausanias (4.20.2), the priestess of Eileithuia at Olympia makes a regular offering to this goddess as also to her cult-hero protégé Sosipolis, and this offering is described as <em>mazas</em> ... <em>memagmenas meliti</em> ‘barley-cakes [<em>mazai</em>] kneaded in honey [<em>meli</em>]’ (μάζας ... μεμαγμένας μέλιτι). In Laconia and Messenia, the goddess <em>Eileithuia</em> was known as <em>Eleuthia</em>, and this form of her name is actually attested in a Linear B tablet found at Knossos. Here is my transcription of the relevant wording that is written in Knossos tablet Gg 705 line 1:</p><p>a-mi-ni-so / e-re-u-ti-ja ME+RI AMPHORA 1</p><p><em>Amnisos: Eleuthiāi meli </em>[followed by the ideogram for “amphora”] 1</p><p>‘Amnisos: for Eleuthia, honey, one amphora’.</p><p>We see here at O.19.188 a striking example of details in Homeric poetry that show continuity with the era of Minoan-Mycenaean civilization. My original argumentation concerning the Minoan-Mycenaean heritage of the details we read in this Homeric verse at O.19.188 appeared in Nagy 1969. For further details on what is said by Pausanias 4.20.2 about Eileithuia, see Nagy 2015.02.25. For more on O.19.188 in the overall context of O.19.185–193, I strongly recommend Levaniouk 2011:93–96.  </p>
