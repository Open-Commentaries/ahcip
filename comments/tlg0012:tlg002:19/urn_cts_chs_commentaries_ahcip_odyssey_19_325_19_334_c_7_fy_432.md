<p>Once again, Penelope shows that she knows how to match the hospitality that Odysseus had consistently demonstrated as king of Ithaca—hospitality that will earn for him poetic <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’, O.19.333. This passage, then, will be relevant to the context of <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ at I.24.196.  </p>
