<p>The goddess of the dawn, Ēōs, has a fixed epithet <em>ēri-géneia</em>, meaning ‘early-generated’ or ‘early-generating’, as at O.02.001. This epithet, which is exclusively hers, has a prefix that derives from the old locative adverb <em>êri</em> ‘early’, and Homeric diction actually preserves <em>êri</em> in colloca­tion with <em>ēṓs</em> ‘dawn’ here at O.19.320. This form <em>ēri-géneia</em> is comparable to the name of the earth-encircling river <em>Ēri-danós</em>, as described in Apollonius of Rhodes <em>Argonautica</em> 4.596. The first part of this name <em>Ēri-danós</em> likewise has the prefix <em>êri</em>; the second part –<em>danos</em> seems to mean ‘dew’ or ‘fluid’, and a likely cognate is Indic <em>dā́nu</em>- ‘fluid, dew’.</p>
