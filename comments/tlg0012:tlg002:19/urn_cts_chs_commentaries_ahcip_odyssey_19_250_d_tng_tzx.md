<p>The disguised Odysseus has just finished narrating to Penelope a description of the real Odysseus, giving a variety of details. Here at O.19.250, these details are described as <em>sēmata</em> ‘signs’ that are all ‘recognized’ by Penelope, as indicated by the verb <em>anagignōskein</em> (σήματ&#x27; ἀναγνούσῃ). As noted already in the comment at O.19.215–248, the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note of, notice’ already indicates that a recognition is about to take place.  </p>
