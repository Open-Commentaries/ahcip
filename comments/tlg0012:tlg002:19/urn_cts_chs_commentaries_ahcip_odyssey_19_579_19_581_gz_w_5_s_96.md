<p>Penelope’s memory and mindfulness of her marriage to Odysseus are exceptional in the <em>Odyssey</em>: other women, we are told (O.15.20-23), tend to forget their previous marriage and children when remarrying, but Penelope here, in proposing the contest of the bow to determine the successful suitor, presents herself as doing the opposite (these lines are repeated at O.21.77-79 when she actually issues the challenge). Compare O.24.194-198, where Agamemnon singles out Penelope’s memory of Odysseus as that which deserves commemorating as a <em>kleos</em>. Penelope stands out as an example of socially ethical behavior.</p>
