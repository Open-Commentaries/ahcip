<p>The generic nightingale, as she sings her song, modulates her tune, ‘changing it around’—which is how I translate <em>trōpôsa</em> (τρωπῶσα) here at I.19.521. The sound made by the songbird’s song is described in this same verse as <em>poluēkhḗs</em> ‘with many resoundings’ (accusative πολυηχέα), but there is a variant reading reported by Aelian <em>On the nature of animals</em> 5.36: <em>poludeukḗs</em> (likewise accusative πολυδευκέα) ‘with many continuations’. Morphologically, this form <em>poludeukḗs</em> ‘with many continuations’ is the opposite of <em>adeukḗs</em>, meaning ‘discontinuous, interrupting’—in other words, ‘with no continuations’. For more on the meaning of <em>adeukḗs</em>, see the anchor comment at O.04.489.  </p>
