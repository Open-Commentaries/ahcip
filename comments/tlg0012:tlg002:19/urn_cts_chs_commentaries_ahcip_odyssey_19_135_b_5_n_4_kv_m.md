<p>In the comment at O.17.381–394, I noted the listing there of four kinds of craftsment who belong to the category of <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>) ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’, where <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ is to be understood as a legally-sanctioned zone of activity within which craftsmen are authorized to be practicing their crafts. The four kinds of craftsmen were the <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’, the <em>iētēr</em> ‘physician’, and the <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’ at O.17.384 and the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ or poet at O.17.385. Now we see here at O.19.135 a fifth kind of craftsman, the <em>kērux</em> ‘herald.’  </p>
