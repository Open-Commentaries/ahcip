<p>ἀλλ’ ἄγε μοι τὸν ὄνειρον ὑπόκριναι καὶ ἄκουσον</p><p>Come, respond [<em>hupo-krinesthai</em>] to my dream [<em>oneiros</em>], and hear my telling of it.</p><p>When Penelope challenges the disguised Odysseus to interpret her <em>oneiros</em> ‘dream’, the word that is used in her challenge here at O.19.535 is <em>hupo-krinesthai</em>, which I translate as ‘respond to (a sign), interpret’; the same word is used at O.19.555 when the disguised Odysseus refers to the challenge. The verb <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> is used at O.19.535 in the imperative, and the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>, is in the accusative; likewise at O.19.555, <em>hupo-krinesthai</em> takes the accusative of the word for ‘dream’, <em>oneiros</em>. This verb is derived from <em>krinein</em>/<em>krinesthai</em>, the basic meaning of which is ‘separate, distinguish, judge’. The verb <em>krinein</em>, in the active voice, can be translated as ‘interpret’ when combined with the noun <em>opsis</em>, ‘vision’, as its object (Herodotus 7.19.1-2) or with <em>enupnion</em>, ‘dream’, as its object (Herodotus 1.120.1). It is a question of interpreting-in-performance. In the middle voice, <em>hupo-krinestha</em>i suggests that the performer is interpreting for himself as well as for others. The basic idea of <em>hupo-krinesthai</em>, then, is to see the real meaning of what others see and to quote back, as it were, what this vision is really telling them. Such a vision distinguishes what is real from what is unreal.  </p>
