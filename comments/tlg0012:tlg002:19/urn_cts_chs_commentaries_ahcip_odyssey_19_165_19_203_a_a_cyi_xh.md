<p>Here at O.19.165–203 we see the third example of “Cretan lies” told by Odysseus in the context of his re-entry into the kingdom of Ithaca. The first example is at O.13.256–286 and the second is at O.14.192–359.  The concept of “Cretan lies” was introduced in the anchor comment at O.01.284–286 on <em>Cretan Odyssey</em>.  </p>
