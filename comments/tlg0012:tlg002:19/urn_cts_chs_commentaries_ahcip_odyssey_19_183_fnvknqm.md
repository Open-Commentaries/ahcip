<p>This name Aithōn derives from the participle <em>aíthōn</em> of the verb <em>aíthein</em> ‘burn’. In the lore of fable, <em>aithōn</em> suits such characters as the crafty fox who is ‘burning’ with hunger and will rely on his craftiness to find ways to feed his insatiable stomach. Such lore is reported in the scholia for Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 11.9, where the generic <em>alōpēx</em> ‘fox’ is actually described as <em>aithōn</em>. Such a description can apply in negative contexts to a beggar in pursuit of food for his insatiable stomach, who in turn is comparable to a greedy blame poet in pursuit of rewards for his poetry. See the comment on O.18.001–004. In positive contexts, on the other hand, the name Aithōn can apply to a righteous man who is ‘burning’ with hunger for justice, as in Theognis 1209–1210 (commentary and further details in GMP 273–274). For more on Aithōn, I strongly recommend the analysis of Levaniouk 2011:36–49.  </p>
