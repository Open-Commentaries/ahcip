<p>The emotional response of Penelope to the Third Cretan Tale as told by the disguised Odysseus is to break down in tears. The idea of her <em>melting away in tears</em>, as expressed by way of the verb <em>tēkesthai</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’ at O.19.204 and O.19.208, is directly compared here by way of simile—ὡς ‘just as’ at O.19.205—to the melting of snow on top of a mountain when it makes contact with the West Wind: here the basic physical process of a <em>melting</em> of snow is expressed by way of the verb <em>kata-tēkesthai</em>/<em>kata-tēkein</em> ‘melt away, dissolve’ at O.19.205/O.19.206. If such familiar idioms as <em>melting away in tears</em> did not exist in the English language today, as also in other modern languages, then the very idea that the <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’ of Penelope at O.19.204 and her <em>parēïa</em> ‘cheeks’ at O.19.208 were ‘melting away’, as expressed by <em>tēkesthai</em>’, would surely seem far more defamiliarizing. But the fact is, a feeling that is quite alien is happening in the Homeric comparison here: a macrocosmic process of melting snow is being drawn into a microcosmic personal experience of pouring out your tears from your eyes, all over your complexion—with the result that all of you liquifies. Here the world of similes and metaphors extends into the world of metonymy: the emotional intensity of personal experience connects to the dynamics of the cosmos, as when snow melts.   </p>
