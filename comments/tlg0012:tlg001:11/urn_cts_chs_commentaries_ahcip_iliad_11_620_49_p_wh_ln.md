<p>Eurymedon here is explicitly called the <em>therapōn</em> of Nestor, functioning as the ‘attendant’ of the old hero: at this moment, Eurymedon is taking care of the horse team of Patroklos, who has just driven his chariot to the headquarters of Nestor as the old hero’s guest, I.11.618–622. That passage is analyzed in the context of comparable passages at I.04.227.</p><p>For a complete list of Iliadic occurrences of <em>therapōn</em>, see the comment on I.01.321.</p>
