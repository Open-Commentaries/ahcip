<p>Achilles calls out to Patroklos, who now comes out of the shelter. At this moment Patroklos is described as <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’, and the very application of this epithet here to Patroklos dooms him to die as a ritual substitute for Ares as god of war. That is why the ominous remark is added: ‘and that was the beginning of his doom’ (κακοῦ δ&#x27; ἄρα οἱ πέλεν ἀρχή). Much later, when he is finally killed, Patroklos is described as <em>atalantos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’, I.16.784. For Patroklos, however, the ritual substitution involves not only Ares who is the god of war for the generic warrior: it involves also the god Apollo as the divine antagonist of Achilles. In <em>Iliad</em> 16, the death of Patroklos as a ritual substitute will be marked not only by the epithet <em>atalantos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ at I.16.784 but also by the epithet <em>daimoni īsos</em> ‘equal to a superhuman-force [<em>daimōn</em>]’ at I.16.705 and at I.16.786. This <em>daimōn</em> ‘superhuman force’ will be Apollo, the divine antagonist of Achilles.  </p>
