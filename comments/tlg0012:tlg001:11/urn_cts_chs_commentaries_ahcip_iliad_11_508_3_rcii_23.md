<p>The idea of ‘breathing out’ something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ implies that such power was previously ‘breathed in’, that is, ‘breathed into’ the hero, by a divine force. Such a ‘breathing in’ happens for example at I.10.482: as it is pointed out in the comment on that verse, the goddess Athena is pictured there in the act of literally ‘breathing’, <em>pneîn</em>, into the hero Odysseus something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’. Here at I.11.508, the aggregate of warriors who are ‘breathing-out [<em>pneîn</em>] mental-power [<em>menos</em>]’ are the Achaeans viewed as a group; so also at I.03.008; by contrast, at I.02.536, the epithet applies to a sub-group, the Abantes.</p>
