<p>Here at I.11.297, two verses after I.11.295, where Hector is described as <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ (ἶσος Ἄρηϊ), the same Trojan hero is now further described as <em>īsos aellēi</em> ‘equal to a blast of wind’ (ἶσος ἀέλλῃ). This verse-final phrase <em>īsos aellēi</em> ‘equal to a blast of wind’ (ἶσος ἀέλλῃ) matches rhythmically the verse-final phrase <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ (ἶσος Ἄρηϊ). Aside from the match in form, there is also a deep-seated match in meaning here between the phrases ‘equal to Ares’ and ‘equal to a blast of wind’, since the god of war is traditionally linked with violent winds. See the comment on I.05.430. Such a link is also attested in the cognate poetics of other Indo-European languages besides Greek: analysis in a later comment (via BA 334, 337).  </p>
