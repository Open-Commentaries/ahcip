<p>In the words of Diomedes, the Will of Zeus is now in effect: the plan of the god is to give <em>kratos</em> ‘winning-power’ to the Trojans and to take it away from the Achaeans, I.11.319. In this verse, we see that Zeus ‘wishes’ for this to happen, as expressed by the verb <em>boulesthai</em> ‘want, wish, plan’. See also the comment on I.11.078–079, where <em>boulesthai</em> ‘wish, plan’ is already expressing the same idea. And, by taking <em>kratos</em> ‘winning-power’ away from the Achaeans, Zeus is giving them <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ instead, on which see the comment on I.01.509.  </p>
