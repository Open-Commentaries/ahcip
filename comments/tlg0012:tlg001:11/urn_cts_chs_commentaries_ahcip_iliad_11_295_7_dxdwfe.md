<p>The description of Hector as <em>īsos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ here at I.11.295 is parallel to his being described as <em>atalantos Arēi</em> ‘equal to Ares’ at I.08.215. For Hector and in fact for any heroic warrior in the <em>Iliad</em>, even for generic warriors, the idea of being ‘equal to Ares’ is parallel to the idea of being a <em>therapōn</em> of Ares, where <em>therapōn</em> is to be understood in the deeper sense of ‘ritual substitute’. About this deeper sense, see the comment on I.02.110.  </p>
