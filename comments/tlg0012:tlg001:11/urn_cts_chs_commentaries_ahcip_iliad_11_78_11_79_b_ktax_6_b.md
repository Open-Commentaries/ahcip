<p>At I.11.078, the gods are said to hold Zeus <em>aitios</em> ‘responsible’, as expressed by the verb <em>aitiân</em>, derived from the adjective <em>aitios</em>, for the fact that the Trojans are now winning in the Trojan War while the Achaeans are losing. At I.11.079, this fact is attributed to the Will of Zeus: the god ‘wishes’ for this to happen, as expressed by the verb <em>boulesthai</em> ‘ wish, plan’. </p>
