<p>There are three passages where the word <em>therapeuein</em> seems at first sight to have nothing to do with a meaning such as ‘heal, cure’. I start with <em>Odyssey</em> 13.265. Here the first-person narrator of a “Cretan tale” says that he was unwilling to ‘be a <em>therapōn</em>’, <em>therapeuein</em>, for the over-king of Crete, Idomeneus, preferring instead to be the leader of his own comrades. The next passage is at <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 390, where the god Apollo selects a group of Cretans to serve as his attendants, <em>therapeuein</em>, at his shrine in Delphi. Finally, the third passage is at Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 135, where the prototypical humans who represent the second generation of humankind are said to be unwilling to serve as attendants, <em>therapeuein</em>, to the gods; and, as we read in the next verse, these sacrilegious early humans are likewise unwilling to perform sacrifices to the gods at their altars (<em>Works and Days</em> 136).</p>
