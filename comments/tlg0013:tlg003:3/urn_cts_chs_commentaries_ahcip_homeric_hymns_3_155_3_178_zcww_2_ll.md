<p>The hymning of Apollo at the cult center of his sacred island of Delos is idealized, as I have argued, in the first part of the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> (the second part honors the god as worshipped at the rival cult center of Delphi). But the actual hymning of the god takes on other forms in the historical present. Whereas Apollo is hymned by an idealized chorus of Delian Maidens in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> (156-178), there is evidence for real choruses that hymned the god at his Delian festival in the historical period of the fifth century BCE and thereafter. </p>
