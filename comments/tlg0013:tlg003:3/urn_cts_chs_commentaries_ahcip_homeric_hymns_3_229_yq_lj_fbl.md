<p>comment on the generic verse as at 239 as occurring also here, and omission of 239-242 as solving the problems in the passage, in the context of the analysis of the one real exception to the hymn’s geographical coherence, the Kephisos River’s being out of place, as an expansion by the victors in the First Sacred War</p>
