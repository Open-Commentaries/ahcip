<p>The scholia report that this line was the very last line of the <em>Odyssey</em> as supposedly composed by Homer—in the opinion of both Aristarchus and his predecessor, Aristophanes of Byzantium. Whatever their opinion may have been, there is evidence to show that both these editors of Homeric poetry retained in their editions of the base text the remaining lines of <em>Odyssey</em> 23 and the lines of <em>Odyssey</em> 24. For an example of such evidence, see the comment at O.23.310–343.  </p>
