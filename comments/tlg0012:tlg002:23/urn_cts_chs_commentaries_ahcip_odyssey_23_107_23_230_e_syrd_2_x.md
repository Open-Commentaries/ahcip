<p>The ultimate <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ for the mutual recognition of Penelope and Odysseus is the immovable bed that the king had made to be shared with the queen. Within the space of the lines demarcated by O.23.107–230, the noun <em>sēma</em> recurs at O.23.110, O.23.188, O.23.202, O.23.206, O.23.225. The mutual recognition is confirmed by the verb <em>anagignōskein</em> ‘recognize’, when Penelope at long last overtly recognizes Odysseus at O.23.206.  </p>
