<p>The two divine horses that draw the chariot of Ēōs, goddess of the dawn, are here named as <em>Phaéthōn</em> and <em>Lámpōn</em>. These names, both referring to the radiance of the sun, are parallel to the names for the two daughters of Hēlios, god of sunlight, who are <em>Phaéthousa</em> and <em>Lampetíē</em>. See also the comment at O.12.132. As already noted there, these four names and the myths linked with them reflect mythological traditions that can be reconstructed by way of Indo-European linguistics.</p>
