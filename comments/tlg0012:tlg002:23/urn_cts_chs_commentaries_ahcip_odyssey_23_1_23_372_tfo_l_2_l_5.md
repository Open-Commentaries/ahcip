<p>After the killing of the suitors, Eurykleia rushes to the bedroom of Penelope, waking her up. The queen has slept through it all—the first good night’s sleep she has had in the longest time, she admits. Eurykleia goes on to tell Penelope that Odysseus has really returned and has killed the suitors, but the patient wife will need one more test, to make it perfectly certain that she has recovered her husband. The <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’ of the royal bed that once was theirs and will be theirs once again can now seal their perfect mutual understanding.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/821524001_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Eurykleia waking Penelope (1773).
