<p>At O.23.264–284, Odysseus retells to Penelope the prophecy of Teiresias about the odyssey that still awaits the hero after he has re-established himself as husband of Penelope and as king of Ithaca. The retelling here does not add to what was said already at O.11.119–137, on which I refer to the comment at those lines. But there is one big exception, centering on a most interesting detail: in his quest to travel as far inland as possible, until the oar that he carries on his shoulder is mistaken for a winnowing shovel, the wording of Odysseys has it that he will be passing through many <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ of humankind, Ο.23.267–268. The word <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ here recalls the same word as used in O.01.003, with reference to the journeys of Odysseus in the <em>Odyssey</em>: there too, it is said, the hero will be passing through many <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ of many different kinds of people. The question is, do those <em>astea</em> ‘cities’ belong to the <em>Odyssey</em> or to an odyssey beyond the <em>Odyssey</em>?  </p>
