<p>With reference to the mock feast that Odysseus has orchestrated, the use of this word <em>molpē</em> ‘singing-and-dancing’ at O.23.145 here makes it clear that the merriment of the feasting involves singing as well as dancing. On the use of this same word at O.21.430 with reference to singing and dancing at the festival of Apollo, see the comment at O.21.429–430. While <em>molpē</em> at O.23.145 refers to the actual singing-and-dancing, the playfulness of the song and dance is expressed by the verb <em>paizein</em> ‘play’ at O.23.147. For comparable wording, see the comment at O.06.100–101.</p>
