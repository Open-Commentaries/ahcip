<p>Eurykleia reassures Penelope that the real Odysseus has returned, O.23.073–077, and she notes as proof the hero’s tell-tale scar, O.23.074, which she saw with her own eyes, as first narrated at O.19.388–507. See the comment on those lines. This scar, says Eurykleia, is a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ of the hero’s true identity, O.23.073. Again, I refer to the comment on O.23.073–077.  </p>
