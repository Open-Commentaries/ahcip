<p>Circe instructs Odysseus to offer a <em>khoē</em> ‘libation’ to the dead after he enters Hādēs, O.10.518. This libation, to be poured into a shallow <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’ that he is to dig, O.10.517, will consist of three liquids, which will be poured in the following sequence, O.10.519–520: emulsified honey, water, wine. </p>
