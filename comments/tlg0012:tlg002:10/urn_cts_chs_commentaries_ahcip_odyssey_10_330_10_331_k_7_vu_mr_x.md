<p>In Point 2 of the comment on O.01.001–010, it was noted that the god Hermes, as the ultimate shape-shifter, is described as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> (verses 13, 439). Here at O.10.330, Odysseus is likewise described as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’, and the description is happening in a context where the hero is explicitly being linked with the god Hermes. So, Odysseus too is a shape-shifter, like his divine model Hermes. The importance of this quality of Odysseus as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ is highlighted by the use of this epithet in the very first verse of the <em>Odyssey</em>. Only there at O.01.001 and here at O.10.330 is Odysseus described as <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’. </p>
