<p>|190 ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ ἴδμεν ὅπῃ ζόφος οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἠώς, |191 οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἠέλιος φαεσίμβροτος εἶσ’ ὑπὸ γαῖαν |192 οὐδ’ ὅπῃ ἀννεῖται· ἀλλὰ φραζώμεθα θᾶσσον, |193 εἴ τις ἔτ’ ἔσται μῆτις· ἐγὼ δ’ οὐκ οἴομαι εἶναι.</p><p>|190 My friends, I am speaking this way because I do not know which place is west and which place is east |191 - which is the place where the sun, bringing light for mortals, goes underneath the earth |192 and which is the place where it rises. Still, let us start thinking it through, as quickly as we can, |193 whether there is still any craft [<em>mētis</em>] left. I must tell you, though, I think there is none. </p><p>(Epitomized from H24H 10§§38, 40, 42.) When Odysseus reaches the island of Circe and learns that this place, though it first seems familiar and reminiscent of his own island, is in fact strange and alien and antithetical to home, he despairs. The hero feels he has no intelligence or <em>mētis</em>  left in him to devise a stratagem for a successful homecoming, and his despair is expressed as a feeling of disorientation. He is no longer able to distinguish between orient and occident. To restate in terms of two words used elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the hero is experiencing a loss of orientation in his <em>nóos</em> or ‘thinking’, and this loss is presently blocking his <em>nostos</em>, ‘homecoming’. Despite such moments of disorientation for Odysseus, however, his <em>nóos</em>, ‘thinking’ will ultimately reorient him, steering him away from his Iliadic past and toward his ultimate Odyssean future. That is, the hero’s <em>nóos</em> will make it possible for him to achieve a <em>nostos</em>, which is not only his ‘homecoming’ but also the ‘song about a homecoming’ that is the <em>Odyssey</em>. </p>
