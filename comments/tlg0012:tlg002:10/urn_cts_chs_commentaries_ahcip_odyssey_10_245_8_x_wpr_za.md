<p>See the anchor comment at O.04.489. Again I note the use of this word <em>adeukḗs</em> in a context referring to an interrupted sequence. The <em>potmos</em> ‘fate’ of Odysseus’ companions is <em>adeukḗs</em> because they have been turned into swine and their journey home has thus been <em>interrupted</em>.  </p>
