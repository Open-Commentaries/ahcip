<p>Odysseus here at O.10.189–197 confesses to his companions that he no longer knows where the sun rises or where the sun sets, O.10.190–192, and, accordingly, he expresses his own despair by questioning whether there will be for him any further access to <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, O.10.193. So, the disorientation of Odysseus is linked with loss of <em>mētis</em>. Clearly, the mind of the hero is correlated here with the celestial dynamics of sunset and sunrise. See further the comment on O.10.190–102. (More on this subject in GMP 246.) In response to the hero’s expression of despair, his companions weep uncontrollably, O.10.198–202, and now all they can think about are the horrors they remember having experienced in their encounters with the Cyclops and with Antiphates the Laestrygonian, O.10.199–200. The epithet for one of these two monsters here, the Cyclops, is <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’, O.10.200, which suits not only the cannibalistic Cyclops but also Antiphates the Laestrygonian, who as can see at O.10.115–116 is likewise a cannibal. These memories of cannibalism are most telling, since the name of the Cyclops is linked here with the <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ of this monster, O.10.200. And the link surely extends to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. That monster too, like the Cyclops, is a negative exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’. And such memories evoke the worst moments of the story of the Trojan War as narrated in the <em>Iliad</em>, as when Achilles himself expresses the ghastly urge to eat the body of Hector raw, I.22.346–347. See the comment at I.22.346–348; also at I.23.001–064. So, Achilles as the primary exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ in the <em>Iliad</em> can be seen in this context as a foil for Odysseus as the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in the <em>Odyssey</em>. Even the Iliadic contexts of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ are evoked here, since Cyclops at O.10.200 is described not only as <em>androphagos</em> ‘man-eating’ but also as <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’. Similarly at O.10.106, in an attested variant of that verse, this same description applies also to Antiphates the Laestrygonian. Beyond these two attestations, this epithet <em>megalētor</em> ‘having a heart that is mighty’ occurs nowhere else in the <em>Odyssey</em>, whereas it occurs regularly as a conventional description of generic warriors in the <em>Iliad</em>. That is why I propose to describe the horrific visions of cannibals in the <em>Odyssey</em> as Iliadic nightmares. </p>
