<p>Leaf suggests that these lines “are at least somewhat out of place” because Achilles has just refused to return. This statement follows his argument that it is obvious that <em>Iliad</em> 10 “forms no essential part of the story of the <em>Iliad</em>” (Leaf 1900:423). Hainsworth (1993, <em>ad loc.</em>) similarly remarks, “The open condition, implying the possibility of Akhilleus reentering the fray, is unexpected when such a change of heart has just been ruled out of court. A remote condition … would certainly be more appropriate.” Petegorsky states, “Nestor’s reference to Achilles is curious; for it has the effect of conceding to Achilles the role of the hero who will put a stop to Hector, at the very moment when we would expect him to be suggesting an alternative” (1982:203). But, Petegorsky argues, Achilles’ refusal has in effect made the situation revert to what it was before the Embassy, and this deference to Achilles as the only way to stop Hektor in fact shows how much the Doloneia takes part in the Iliadic tradition, both thematically and in its narrative momentum towards Achilles’ eventual return (1982:177–185). The alternative strategy adopted in <em>Iliad</em> 10, one focused on <em>mētis</em>, spying, and ambush, will not change the <em>Iliad</em>’s traditional course of events, but will highlight through contrast the need for Achilles’ strength to save the Achaeans.</p>
