<p>The goddess Athena is engaged here in the act of <em>en-pneîn</em> ‘breathing into’ the hero Diomedes something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’, I.10.482. Such ‘mental power’ makes the hero aware of his physical power and thus energizes him to perform heroic deeds. At highlighted moments in the <em>Odyssey</em>, Athena engages in comparable moments of intervention.  </p>
