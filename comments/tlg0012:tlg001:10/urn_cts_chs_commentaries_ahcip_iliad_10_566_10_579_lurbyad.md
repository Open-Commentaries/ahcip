<p>The end to the episode confirms what we have seen earlier: that the ambush theme is structurally similar to that of the journey, in that the return takes on a special importance. Now that Diomedes and Odysseus have been welcomed “home” to the camp, the end of their journey into the enemy camp and their successful return is marked by taking a bath and eating a meal, as we see so often in the <em>Odyssey</em>, an epic which is itself an extended version of a journey theme with many journeys and arrivals embedded within it. </p>
