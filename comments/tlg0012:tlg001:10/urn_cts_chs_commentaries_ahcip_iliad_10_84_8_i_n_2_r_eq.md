<p>ἠέ τιν᾽ οὐρήων διζήμενος, ἤ τιν᾽ ἑταίρων</p><p>The idea that someone would be out at night looking for a mule (τιν᾽ οὐρήων) seemed odd to Alexandrian scholars, as it might to us. The A scholia indicates that Aristarchus athetized the line because of that word, suggesting that it should be some form of κοῦρος, to indicate the young men of the guard. Instead of assuming a mistake by the poet (as the scholiast does) or by a scribe, another approach would be to see if there are any traditional associations with mules getting loose at night. There are no examples in surviving Homeric poetry, but there may well have been in the larger tradition. In any case, mules are used in a variety of contexts in the <em>Iliad</em>, by both the Trojans and the Achaeans. (See <em>Iliad</em> 1.50, 23.111 and 115, 24.716 for οὐρεύς; the word ἡμίονος is also used in this book at 10.352 and throughout the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>.)   </p>
