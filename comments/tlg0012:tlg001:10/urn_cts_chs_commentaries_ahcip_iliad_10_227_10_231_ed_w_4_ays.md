<p>We can compare this list with the list of those willing to duel with Hektor (after Nestor’s rebuke) in <em>Iliad</em> 7.162–168. These lists comprise a kind of subtheme that occurs in these types of “selection” situations but also in situations in which the Achaeans “regroup” to fight back (e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 8.261–266, after Diomedes leads the charge). This subtheme seems related both to the idea of volunteering for dangerous assignments, and, in the larger scheme, to the contention among the heroes for who is the “best”—for more on which, see below on 10.236. </p>
