<p>ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δή ῥ᾽ ἄπεσαν δουρηνεκὲς ἢ καὶ ἔλασσον</p><p>As at 10.351, here distance is expressed through comparison. Scott observes that in the Homeric epics, “Similes of distance are the most numerous type of approximate measure” (Scott 1974:21). Since Diomedes will indeed throw his spear at Dolon (10.372–374), this comparison also seems to anticipate how far they remain apart during the chase. The distance of a spear cast is used to picture other distances, such as the length of the pathway by which Apollo bridges the Achaean ditch (<em>Iliad</em> 15.358–360), the length of Achilles’ leap away from the river Xanthos as it pursues him (<em>Iliad</em> 21.251), and how far the Trojans give way to the Achaean charge (<em>Iliad</em> 16.589–592: there, the spear cast may be either in battle or in athletic games, compare 10.351–352 above).  </p>
