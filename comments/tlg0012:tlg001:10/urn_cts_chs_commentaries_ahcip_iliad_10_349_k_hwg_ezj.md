<p>πὰρ᾽ ἒξ ὁδοῦ </p><p>An ambusher may hide just off a road to attack someone traveling along it. In the Homeric epics we have another example of this strategy in one of Odysseus’ Cretan lies in <em>Odyssey</em> 13; Odysseus describes a similar position for the ambush he narrates there: ἐγγὺς ὁδοῖο λοχησάμενος (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.268). We also see such a place for an ambush in Pindar’s description of Herakles’ ambush of the Molione (<em>Olympian</em> 10.26–34, ἐφ’ ὁδῷ, 10.30). At this point we begin to see how easily a spying mission transitions into an ambush once the presence of the enemy is detected.  </p>
