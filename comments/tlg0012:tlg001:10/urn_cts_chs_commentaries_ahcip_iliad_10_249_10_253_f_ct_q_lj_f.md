<p>The words of Odysseus here, I.10.249–253, spoken in response to the preceding words of Diomedes, I.10.241–247, highlight the need for balancing the positive force of praise poetry and the negative force of blame poetry, as expressed respectively here by way of <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’. The idea that Diomedes is speaking to a group who are ‘knowing’, <em>eidótes</em>, is a stylized way of referring to the audiences of epic in general: such audiences would be knowledgeable about how much praise and how much blame Odysseus deserves. </p>
