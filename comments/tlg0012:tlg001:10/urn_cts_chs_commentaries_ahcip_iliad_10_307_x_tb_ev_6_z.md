<p>κῦδος ἄροιτο</p><p>For this use of <em>arnumai</em> with <em>kudos</em> or <em>kleos</em>, compare <em>Iliad</em> 4.95 and 5.3 and <em>Odyssey</em> 1.240. Just as Nestor promises both κλέος and a δόσις for whoever will undertake the spying mission for the Achaeans (see above on 10.212–213), so also Hektor promises a δῶρον (304) and also κῦδος to the volunteer among the Trojans. As we argued above, these are clear indications that success on an ambush was considered prestigious for Homeric warriors.</p>
