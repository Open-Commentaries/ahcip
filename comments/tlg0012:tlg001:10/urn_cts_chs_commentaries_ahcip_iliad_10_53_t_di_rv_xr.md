<p>Αἴαντα</p><p>The Ajax being referred to here is the son of Telamon. (See below on 10.110–113.) Evidence from the Venetus A scholia indicates that Aristarchus may have known a reading Αἴαντε instead of Αἴαντα:</p><p>ὁ μὲν Δίδυμος τὴν Ἀριστάρχειον γραφὴν λέγει “Αἴαντε” δυϊκῶς, ὁ δὲ Τήλεφος λέγει κακῶς εἰρηκέναι τὸν Δίδυμον· οὐ γὰρ ἐπ’ ἀμφοτέρους τοὺς Αἴαντας ὁ Μενέλαος πέμπεται.</p><p>Didymus says that the Aristarchean reading is “Αἴαντε” in the dual, but Telephos says that Didymus has misspoken, since Menelaos is not sent to both Ajaxes.</p><p>This disagreement in the scholia about Aristarchus’ reading may reflect an evolution in the meaning of the dual form Αἴαντε that has been noted by previous scholars. In some early stage of the Greek epic tradition, the dual Αἴαντε referred not to Ajax the son of Telamon and Ajax the son of Oileus as a pair, but rather to Telamonion Ajax and his brother Teucer (whose special fighting style is discussed above at p.60; see Ebbott 2003:41–43 with references <em>ad loc.</em>) The dual form of the name that Aristarchus knew here would be perfectly appropriate in a time when it was understood to refer to Ajax and Teucer. In any case, at 10.228 the two Ajaxes (Αἴαντε δύω) volunteer to go on the spying mission with Diomedes, but it is not clear whether at that point both Ajaxes are volunteering, or whether it is the fighting pair of Ajax and Teucer. It is possible that the dual would have been understood differently by audiences of different periods.  </p>
