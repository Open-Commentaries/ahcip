<p>μερμήριξε</p><p>A type scene in which two options are pondered appears numerous times in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, and this verb is a signal of that traditional scene (see also Arend 1933:106–115 for this type scene). Some of these type scenes involve ambush, as here: Odysseus ponders several times how to ambush and slaughter the suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 16.237, 16.256, 16.261, 19.2 = 19.52, 20.10, 20.28, 20.38, 20.41), while Phemios ponders during that ambush whether to try to escape or to supplicate Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 22.333). Aegisthus is also “pondering hideous things” (ἀεικέα μερμηρίζων, <em>Odyssey</em> 4.533) when he plans his ambush of Agamemnon. In addition, although these episodes are not strictly ambush themes, we find such “pondering” involved prior to plans to deceive, such as Zeus’ sending the deceptive dream to Agamemnon (<em>Iliad</em> 2.3), Hera’s seduction of Zeus (<em>Iliad</em> 14.159), Penelope’s “trick” (<em>dolos</em>) against the suitors (<em>Odyssey</em> 2.93, <em>Odyssey</em> 24.128), and Odysseus’ deception of his father about his identity (<em>Odyssey</em> 24.235).   </p>
