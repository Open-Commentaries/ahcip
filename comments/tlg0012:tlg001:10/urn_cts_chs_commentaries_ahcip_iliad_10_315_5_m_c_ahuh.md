<p>πολύχρυσος πολύχαλκος</p><p>Dolon is also described as wealthy: “rich in gold, rich in bronze.” These epithets are more commonly used of places in our texts, and Dolon is the only person to be called by them. Mycenae is called πολύχρυσος three times (<em>Iliad</em> 7.180, 11.46, <em>Odyssey</em> 3.305). Sidon is called πολύχαλκος (<em>Odyssey</em> 15.425), as is the <em>ouranos</em> (<em>Iliad</em> 5.504; <em>Odyssey</em> 3.2), perhaps because of an association between the sky and the homes of the gods, which have bronze floors (<em>Iliad</em> 1.426, 14.173, 21.438, 21.505, <em>Odyssey</em> 8.321). The combination of both adjectives πολύχρυσος and πολύχαλκος is used only of Troy in our texts (<em>Iliad</em> 18.289), when Hektor says that formerly all mortals used to speak of Priam’s city as rich in gold, rich in bronze, but now the Trojans have had to sacrifice most of that wealth (<em>Iliad</em> 18.285–292). So the question emerges whether the combination of these adjectives evokes an association between Dolon and Priam’s Troy and its eventual doom, despite its wealth. Such an association may be too far-reaching, since in our texts Troy is described with these adjectives only once, although it is a very wealthy city according to tradition. Certainly Dolon’s wealth comes into play after his capture: when he promises Diomedes and Odysseus a great ransom (10.378–381) the traditional characteristic of his wealth indicates that he could indeed pay handsomely in exchange for his life.  </p>
