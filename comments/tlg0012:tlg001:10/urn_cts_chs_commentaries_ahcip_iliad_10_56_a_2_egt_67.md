<p>ἐλθεῖν ἐς φυλάκων ἱερὸν τέλος ἠδ᾽ ἐπιτεῖλαι</p><p>A night watch is explicitly set up in <em>Iliad</em> 9.80–88, where the guards assemble and take their post armed. There, we hear that the guard consists of seven leaders, each of whom is named, and each leader has a hundred young men with long spears. As we will see later (10.196–197), Meriones and Thrasymedes, named as two of the seven in <em>Iliad</em> 9 but given special mention here at 10.57–59, will join the leaders to deliberate about the plan, and, importantly, give Diomedes and Odysseus some of their armor. Back in <em>Iliad</em> 9.87, we are told that the guard takes up their post between the ditch and the wall (see further on 10.194). For more on the anxieties about the watch falling asleep, see on 10.98. See Singor 1992:403 for his arguments that the seven leaders of the night watch implies that the Achaean wall has seven gates, and that the adjective <em>hieros</em> is used here, as well as for both the gatekeepers of Troy (<em>Iliad</em> 24.681) and the walls of Thebes (<em>Iliad</em> 4.378), because defensive walls and the life-sustaining protection they provide are “sacred.”  </p>
