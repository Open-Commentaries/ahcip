<p>Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη  </p><p>Walter Burkert describes Athena this way: “More than any other Greek deity, Athena is always near her protégés—‘Goddess of Nearness’ is how Walter F. Otto described her [Otto 1929/1956]. Wherever difficulties disappear and the impossible becomes possible, Athena is at hand, but her presence does not detract from the achievement of the other” (Burkert 1985:141). Athena is present for Odysseus throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>, and indeed she guides his entire <em>nostos</em> from the opening scene among the gods in Olympia to the conclusion of the strife on Ithaka in the final lines of Odyssey 24. They rival one another in cunning intelligence (<em>mētis</em>) and, as Burkert notes, Odysseus and Athena’s special relationship is exemplified by the way they reveal themselves to one another in <em>Odyssey</em> 13. Each knows the other by the false identity/lying tale that each offers to the other. Odysseus’ story is that he killed a man in Crete (by ambush—λοχησάμενος, 13.268) and fled, ending up in Ithaka. But Athena knows exactly who he is:</p><p>ὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,</p><p>χειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξε· δέμας δ’ ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ</p><p>καλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ·</p><p>290  καί μιν φωνήσασ’ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα·</p><p>κερδαλέος κ’ εἴη καὶ ἐπίκλοπος, ὅς σε παρέλθοι</p><p>ἐν πάντεσσι δόλοισι, καὶ εἰ θεὸς ἀντιάσειε.</p><p>σχέτλιε, ποικιλομῆτα, δόλων ἄατ’, οὐκ ἄρ’ ἔμελλες,</p><p>οὐδ’ ἐν σῇ περ ἐὼν γαίῃ, λήξειν ἀπατάων</p><p>295  μύθων τε κλοπίων, οἵ τοι πεδόθεν φίλοι εἰσίν.</p><p>ἀλλ’ ἄγε μηκέτι ταῦτα λεγώμεθα, <strong>εἰδότες ἄμφω</strong></p><p><strong>κέρδε’, ἐπεὶ σὺ μέν ἐσσι βροτῶν ὄχ’ ἄριστος ἁπάντων</strong></p><p><strong>βουλῇ καὶ μύθοισιν, ἐγὼ δ’ ἐν πᾶσι θεοῖσι</strong></p><p><strong>μήτι τε κλέομαι καὶ κέρδεσιν</strong>· οὐδὲ σύ γ’ ἔγνως</p><p>300  Παλλάδ’ Ἀθηναίην, κούρην Διός, ἥ τέ τοι αἰεὶ</p><p>ἐν πάντεσσι πόνοισι <strong>παρίσταμαι</strong> ἠδὲ φυλάσσω,</p><p>καὶ δέ σε Φαιήκεσσι φίλον πάντεσσιν ἔθηκα.</p><p>νῦν αὖ δεῦρ’ ἱκόμην, ἵνα τοι σὺν <strong>μῆτιν</strong> ὑφήνω</p><p>χρήματά τε κρύψω, ὅσα τοι Φαίηκες ἀγαυοὶ</p><p>305  ὤπασαν οἴκαδ’ ἰόντι <strong>ἐμῇ βουλῇ τε νόῳ</strong> τε …</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 13.287–305</p><p>So he spoke, and the goddess owl-radiant Athena smiled,</p><p>and took him by the hand. In form she resembled a woman</p><p>who was beautiful and tall and skilled in splendid handiwork.</p><p>290  She spoke out and addressed to him winged words:</p><p>“He would have to be a wily thief, the man who could get past you</p><p>in every sort of deception, even if you had a god for an antagonist.</p><p>You are intractable, crafty in intricate ways, insatiate of deception, nor were you about,</p><p>even now that you are in your own country, to leave off from deceiving</p><p>295  and the beguiling words that are constantly dear to you.</p><p>But let’s no longer talk about these things, <strong>since we both know how to be</strong></p><p><strong>wily. You are the best of all mortals</strong></p><p><strong>in planning [<em>boulē</em>] and words, while I among all the gods</strong></p><p><strong>have glory for my craft [<em>mētis</em>] and wiles</strong>. Yet you did not know that</p><p>300  I am Pallas Athena, the daughter of Zeus, who always</p><p><strong>stands by</strong> you in all your labors and watches over you,</p><p>who made you dear to all the Phaeacians.</p><p>Now again I have come here, in order to weave <em>mētis</em> with you</p><p>and hide all the goods that the noble Phaeacians</p><p>305  gave to you when you went homewards <strong>by my planning <em>[boulē] </em>and my thinking</strong> … ”</p><p>Athena is the god that most resembles Odysseus; she embodies the <em>boulē</em>, <em>mētis</em>, <em>kerdea</em>, <em>doloi</em>, and <em>noos</em> that Odysseus is legendary for in the epic tradition (skills that are the hallmark of ambush warfare). So here too in <em>Iliad</em> 10 Athena is near to Odysseus, and he prays that she stand by him as she has done in the past (παρίστατσαι, 10.279). Note the same formula used in 10.279 and <em>Odyssey</em> 13.301: Athena there asserts that she does indeed stand by him in his many labors.</p><p>On Odysseus’ relationship with Athena in the <em>Iliad</em>, see also Haft 1990:42, who, in discussing the many parallels between <em>Iliad</em> 2 and 10, notes that Athena makes an epiphany to Odysseus in that book. On Diomedes’ relationship with Athena, see below on 10.285.</p>
