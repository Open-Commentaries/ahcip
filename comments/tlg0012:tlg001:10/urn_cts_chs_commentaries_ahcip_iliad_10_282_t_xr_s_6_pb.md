<p>ῥέξαντας μέγα ἔργον, ὅ κεν Τρώεσσι μελήσει</p><p>An interlinear scholion on this line in the Venetus A indicates that Aristarchus understood this “great deed” to mean murdering Hektor. See the Rhesos section of the “Tradition and Reception” essay for more on the theory that a mission to assassinate Hektor might have been told in some versions. Just such an assassination attempt is the initial object of Odysseus and Diomedes’ mission in the tragedy <em>Rhesos</em> (575–576). But we should note that, within the context of <em>Iliad</em> 10, the murder of Rhesos and his men fulfills Odysseus’ prayer (see below on 10.524).   </p>
