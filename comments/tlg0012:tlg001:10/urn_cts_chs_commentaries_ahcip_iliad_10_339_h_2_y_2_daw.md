<p>ἐφράσατο</p><p>Odysseus does just what Diomedes had wanted from a partner (see above, 10.224–226): he observes first what Diomedes has not yet seen—the presence of another man out in the night. His powers of observation stand in contrast to Dolon’s lack of attention, his ἀφραδίη (10.350), which shares the same root with this verb.   </p>
