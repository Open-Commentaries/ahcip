<p>ἄμφω νοστήσαιμεν, ἐπεὶ περίοιδε νοῆσαι</p><p>Odysseus’ primary heroic identity is concerned with <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, which is the subject of the epic devoted to him. (See Nagy 1979:35 and 38–39.) Douglas Frame has shown that the words <em>nostos</em> and <em>noos</em> ‘mind’ share the verbal root <em>*nes-</em>, whose meaning has to do with “returning to life and light” (a meaning best understood, according to Frame, in the context of solar symbolism), and that the two concepts are combined on a conceptual and verbal level throughout the <em>Odyssey</em>. (Cf. e.g. the opening lines of the <em>Odyssey</em>, 1.3–5: πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ <strong>νόον</strong> ἔγνω … ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ <strong>νόστον</strong> ἑταίρων [“Many are the cities of men and their <strong>ways of thinking</strong> he came to know, as he strove to win the life and <strong>homecoming</strong> of his companions.”]) See especially Frame 2005a and 2005b; on the root <em>*nes</em>, see also Frame 2009 and Bonifazi 2009. We can see that the deep connection between <em>nostos</em> and <em>noos</em> is built into the traditional character of Odysseus and comes into focus whenever he is featured, be it in the Iliad or the <em>Odyssey</em>.</p><p>We have already seen some indications (on 10.211–212) that spying missions share some traditional language and thematic associations with journeys. Diomedes’ choice of Odysseus as the master of the kind of journey called a <em>nostos</em> (due to his quality of <em>noos</em>) is another example of this commonality. See also below on 10.509.  </p>
