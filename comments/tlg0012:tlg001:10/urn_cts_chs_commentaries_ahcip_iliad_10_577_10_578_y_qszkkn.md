<p>τὼ δὲ <strong>λοεσσαμένω</strong> καὶ <strong>ἀλειψαμένω</strong> λίπ᾽ ἐλαίῳ / δείπνῳ <strong>ἐφιζανέτην</strong></p><p>Even at the end of the mission, dual forms are used for the actions of Diomedes and Odysseus. Such dual verbs and the teamwork they embody are such a deep-rooted part of the ambush theme that they continue to be used in these final actions of the night. See above on 10.243 and 10.254 for more on these dual forms.  </p>
