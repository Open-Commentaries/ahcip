<p>τῷ δ᾽ ἔμπνευσε μένος γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη</p><p>Athena breathes <em>menos</em> ‘force’ into Diomedes as he starts the slaughter. A similar expression is used for Apollo breathing <em>menos</em> into Hektor so that he may return to battle (ὣς εἰπὼν ἔμπνευσε μένος μέγα ποιμένι λαῶν, <em>Iliad</em> 15.262; Apollo does so at Zeus’ suggestion, see <em>Iliad</em> 15.60), and he does the same for Aeneas later (<em>Iliad</em> 20.110). We also see a connection between <em>menos</em> and breathing at <em>Iliad</em> 3.8, where the Achaeans breathe <em>menos</em> as they enter battle. During Diomedes’ <em>aristeia</em> in the <em>polemos</em>, Athena tells him that she has put <em>menos</em> into his chest, the kind of <em>menos</em> his father used to have (<em>Iliad</em> 5.124–126). Thus this “inspiration” happens between gods and their favorites, and we find in this episode in Book 10 a pattern of opposition between Athena and Apollo (we can compare their direct rivalry in <em>Iliad</em> 7). In the <em>Rhesos,</em> Athena uses speech instead to incite ambush, as she prompts Diomedes and Odysseus to attack Rhesos and the Thracians though they are ready to turn back to their own camp (<em>Rhesos</em> 594–625; see also Fantuzzi 2006b:163–170).  </p>
