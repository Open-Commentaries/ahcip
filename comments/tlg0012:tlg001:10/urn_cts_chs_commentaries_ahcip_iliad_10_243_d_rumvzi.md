<p>This verse is also used at <em>Odyssey</em> 1.65 (and compare how the phrasing of <em>Odyssey</em> 1.66 is similar to that of 10.244). There, it is Zeus speaking in response to Athena, saying that he could not overlook Odysseus. Since <em>Iliad</em> 10, like the <em>Odyssey</em>, features Odysseus in a prominent role, the formula seems to be useful and good for introducing Odysseus in a starring role. </p>
