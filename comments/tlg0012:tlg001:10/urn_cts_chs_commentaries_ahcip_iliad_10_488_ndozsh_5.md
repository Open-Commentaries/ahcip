<p>δυώδεκ᾽(α) </p><p>Gernet (1936:200) argues that twelve victims is a number with ritual significance, and we can compare the sacrifices of twelve cows (<em>Iliad</em> 6.93 = 6.274 = 6.308) and twelve sheep (<em>Odyssey</em> 8.59), as well as the twelve Trojan youths Achilles sacrifices on Patroklos’ pyre (<em>Iliad</em> 21.27–28, <em>Iliad</em> 23.175). Germain (1954:17–18) notes that in the <em>Iliad</em> twelve is a number used for enemies killed and similarly relates that usage to its use as a number of sacrificial victims. </p>
