<p>χρεὼ βουλῆς ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ … κερδαλέης</p><p>Here again we see a parallel with <em>Iliad</em> 9. Compare Nestor’s words at 9.74–76: πολλῶν δ’ ἀγρομένων τῷ πείσεαι ὅς κεν ἀρίστην/βουλὴν βουλεύσῃ· μάλα δὲ χρεὼ πάντας Ἀχαιοὺς/ἐσθλῆς καὶ πυκινῆς (“When many are gathered you can be persuaded to obey him who counsels the best plan. All of the Achaeans are especially in need of good, close [<em>pukinos</em>] counsel”). In 10.17, Agamemnon, after tossing and turning with grief and worry, comes up with a plan (βουλή), a sequence that, as we have seen, parallels the opening of Book 2. He decides that he will go to Nestor and ask <em>him</em> to come up with a plan (there called μῆτιν). <em>Boulē</em> is used therefore in several places in <em>Iliad</em> 2, 9, and 10 to denote a plan of action. As it happens, all three plans are conceived and carried out during the night, and it seems that in these contexts <em>boulē</em> is closely associated with <em>mētis</em>. (See also 10.302, where Hektor likewise conceives of a πυκινὴν … βουλήν in a line that matches <em>Iliad</em> 2.55 in our texts. According to the testimony that has survived about the <em>Cypria</em> [testimonium 1 Bernabé], that epic opened with Zeus in distress about the overpopulation of the earth. It is unfortunately not clear from the context whether Zeus is attempting to sleep or if these thoughts are in fact occurring during the day, but the thoughts that lead to the plan he formulates, called βουλή in line 7 of the surviving fragment, are termed πυκιναῖς πραπίδεσσιν [3].) Here in Book 10 Agamemnon says that their plan must be wily (κερδαλέης); in Book 9 the adjective used is <em>pukinos</em> (as at 10.302; see also on 10.5–9 above). In <em>Odyssey</em> 13, Athena calls Odysseus “by far the best of all mortals in planning” (βροτῶν ὄχ’ ἄριστος ἁπάντων βουλῇ, 13.297–298) and “crafty in intricate ways” (ποικιλομῆτα, 13.293). In <em>Odyssey</em> 22.230, Athena tells Odysseus that the city of Troy was taken by his <em>boulē</em> (σῇ δ’ ἥλω βουλῇ Πριάμου πόλις εὐρυάγυια)—another ambush that according to epic tradition occurred at night. This is how Menelaos describes Odysseus in the wooden horse when he tells Telemakhos the story in <em>Odyssey</em> 4:</p><p>ἤδη μὲν πολέων ἐδάην βουλήν τε νόον τε</p><p>ἀνδρῶν ἡρώων, πολλὴν δ’ ἐπελήλυθα γαῖαν·</p><p>ἀλλ’ οὔ πω τοιοῦτον ἐγὼν ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν</p><p>οἷον Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἔσκε φίλον κῆρ.</p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 4.267–270</p><p>I have become familiar with the planning and thinking</p><p>of men who are heroes, and I have traveled over much of the earth.</p><p>But I have not yet known with my eyes a man equivalent</p><p>to my friend Odysseus’ enduring mind.</p><p>The <em>boulē</em> of the wooden horse is arguably Odysseus’ signature <em>mētis</em>, on which see Haft 1990.</p>
