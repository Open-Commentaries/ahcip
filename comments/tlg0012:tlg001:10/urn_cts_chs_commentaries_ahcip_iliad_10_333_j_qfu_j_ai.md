<p>καμπύλα τόξα</p><p>Odysseus, too, carries a bow on this night mission (which he will end up using only to whip the horses, see 10.260 and 10.500). McLeod (1988) argues that the bow is an effective weapon at night. See on 10.29, 10.260, and our essay “The Poetics of Ambush” for thematic associations between archery and ambush.   </p>
