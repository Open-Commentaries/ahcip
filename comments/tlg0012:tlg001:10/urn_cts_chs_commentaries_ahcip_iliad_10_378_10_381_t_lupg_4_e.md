<p>This offer of ransom for being taken alive rather than killed is another example of both the traditional language of <em>Iliad</em> 10 and the Doloneia’s place within the Iliadic tradition. Donna Wilson has demonstrated that, although there are references to ransoming practices that occur before the direct action of the <em>Iliad</em>, within that direct action the taking of prisoners does not happen, and all appeals to ransom are rejected (2002:29–34). As she notes, “The <em>Iliad</em> develops the compensation theme temporally in such a way that all offers of <em>apoina</em> mentioned as taking place <em>before</em> Chryses’ offer in Book 1 or <em>after</em> Priam’s in Book 24 are successful or potentially successful. But all offers of <em>apoina</em> in the time <em>between</em> Chryses’ and Priam’s offers fail” (Wilson 2002:31, original emphasis). Thus the refusal to ransom Dolon (and killing him instead) fits into the overall treatment of this theme in the <em>Iliad</em>. See <em>Iliad</em> 21.34–44 for the example of Lykaon as a prisoner taken alive during a nighttime ambush (which temporally happens before Chryses’ offer).</p><p>The offer that Dolon makes uses the traditional, formulaic language of such offers of <em>apoina</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>. We see the same language of 10.379–381 used at <em>Iliad</em> 6.48–50, when Adrestos supplicates Menelaos to ransom him, and also at <em>Iliad</em> 11.133–135, when two brothers, Peisandros and Hippolokhos, supplicate Agamemnon (with the necessary changes of singular and dual/plural pronouns in each of the three situations). In all three cases, just as Wilson has observed, the plea is rejected and the supplicant is killed instead (Dol</p><p>on will attempt a supplicatory gesture just before he is killed, see 10.454–456).</p>
