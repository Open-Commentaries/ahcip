<p>ἠθεῖε  </p><p>This word cannot be precisely translated into English. Its contexts suggest that it conveys both the affection and respect of younger person for an older one (as of Paris and Hektor in <em>Iliad</em> 6.518, Deiphobos and Hektor in <em>Iliad</em> 22.229 and 239, and Achilles and Patroklos in <em>Iliad</em> 23.94), or of a trusted servant for a respected master (Eumaios and Odysseus in <em>Odyssey</em> 14.147). </p>
