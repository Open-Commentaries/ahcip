<p>τὸν ἄριστον</p><p>Agamemnon tells Diomedes to choose the “best” man. The question of who is the “best of the Achaeans” is a theme that runs throughout the <em>Iliad</em>, as Gregory Nagy has shown. In the catalogue of ships (<em>Iliad</em> 2.761), the narrator asks the Muses who was the best (<em>aristos</em>) of the Achaeans, and answers that it was Ajax, so long as Achilles had <em>mēnis</em> (2.768–769). But as Nagy points out, the claim to being best of the Achaeans is a disputed and divided one in the <em>Iliad</em>, precisely because the acknowledged best, Achilles, has withdrawn. The <em>Odyssey</em> tradition is not divided, however. There, Odysseus is the unquestioned best (Nagy 1979:26–35 and passim). So too in the Doloneia tradition is Odysseus the “best,” and here he is so in part because of his association with <em>nostos</em> ‘return, homecoming’, as Diomedes states explicitly (see below on 10.243).</p><p>An interesting correlation to this competition to be the “best” in epic is that ambushes feature the “best” men. (See also Edwards 1985:18–24.) There are several examples of the best men going on ambush in Homeric epic. Achilles states that Agamemnon does not go on ambush with the best (σύν ἀριστήεσσιν, <em>Iliad</em> 1.227). Idomeneus’ description of ambush involves a gathering of the best (ἄριστοι, <em>Iliad</em> 13.276). Those in the Wooden Horse are the best (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.272, 8.512–513, 11.523–524), and the best men are selected for ambushes of Bellerophon (<em>Iliad</em> 6.188), Proteus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.409), and Agamemnon (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.530–531). Even in a Cretan lie, Odysseus says that he used to choose the best men for ambush (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.217–218). We can also see that the best are involved in ambush warfare because both Odysseus and Achilles participate in nighttime ambushes (see “The Poetics of Ambush”).  </p>
