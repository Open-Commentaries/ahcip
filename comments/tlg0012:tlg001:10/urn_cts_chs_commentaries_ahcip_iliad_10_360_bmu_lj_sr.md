<p>καρχαρόδοντε δύω κύνε εἰδότε</p><p>The dual forms that the text of the Venetus A manuscript records for the hunting dogs in this simile seem to emphasize the coordinated attack by the dogs and, by association, by Diomedes and Odysseus. We often see dual forms used for these two in this book (see also on 10.243), and we find dual forms used in another simile elsewhere when the Aiante are compared to two lions in the dual as they fight together (<em>Iliad</em> 13.198–202). Some manuscripts, however, record the plural κύνες instead.   </p>
