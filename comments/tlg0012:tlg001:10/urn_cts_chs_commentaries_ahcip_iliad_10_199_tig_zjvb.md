<p>ἐν καθαρῷ, ὅθι δὴ νεκύων διεφαίνετο χῶρος</p><p>Another significant feature of the landscape on this night is the number of corpses left on the battlefield. No truce has been allowed this time for the gathering of the dead (compare the truce agreed to at <em>Iliad</em> 7.407–411). The Trojan camp is also in a space specifically said to be free of corpses (this same line is also used at <em>Iliad</em> 8.491), and a picture of the landscape covered with corpses is repeatedly evoked (10.298, 10.343 = 10.387, 10.469). Such a detail is a reminder of the intense battle of the day before, which is the reason both for the embassy to Achilles and for this meeting, which will result in the spying mission and ambush. It is also a harbinger of the even greater battle that will happen on the next day, adding to the eerie atmosphere of the nighttime landscape.   </p>
