<p>νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην</p><p>In the Venetus A, the oldest complete medieval manuscript of the <em>Iliad</em>, ὀρφναίην is written in the margin next to νύκτα δι᾽ ἀμβροσίην at this line (see Figure 5), and a thirteenth-century manuscript (Vaticanus Graecus 26) prints ὀρφναίην here instead of ἀμβροσίην. On the significance of the two adjectives and the variation we find here, see above on 10.41.   </p>
