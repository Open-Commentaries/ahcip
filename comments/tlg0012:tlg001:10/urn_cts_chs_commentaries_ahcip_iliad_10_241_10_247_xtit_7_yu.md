<p>Diomedes chooses Odysseus as the most qualified to accompany him, saying at I.10.247 that he and Odysseus would have the best chance at ‘having a (successful) homecoming’, expressed here by the verb <em>nosteîn</em>, because Odysseus has superior expertise in ‘taking note’, expressed here by the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’. Here we see the special links of the hero Odysseus with the Odyssean themes expressed by the noun/verb <em>nóos</em>/<em>noeîn</em>, basically meaning ‘mind’ / ‘take note (of), notice, have in mind’, and the noun/verb <em>nóstos</em>/<em>nosteîn</em>, basically meaning ‘homecoming’/’have a homecoming’. On the ideas expressed by <em>noeîn</em> in connection with Odysseus, see the anchor comment at I.05.669.  </p>
