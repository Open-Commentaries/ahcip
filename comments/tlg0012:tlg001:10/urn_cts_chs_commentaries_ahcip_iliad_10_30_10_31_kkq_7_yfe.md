<p>αὐτὰρ ἐπὶ στεφάνην κεφαλῆφιν ἀείρας / θήκατο χαλκείην</p><p>Menelaos wears a helmet that is unsuited to a spying mission or ambush. It is bronze, which, as we hear about the spear points in Diomedes’ encampment, shines even through the dark of night (see 10.152–154). Such armament is a liability, therefore, to stealth and to remaining undetected in the dark (see more on 10.257). Diomedes, Odysseus, and Dolon all wear leather caps to protect their heads on these missions (10.257–259, 10.261–265, 10.335). Although Menelaos is involved in other ambushes within the epic tradition, this subtle detail of his chosen dress here may indicate to a traditional audience that Menelaos is not going to be chosen for this expedition. We may note the anxiety expressed in Agamemnon’s words to Diomedes about his choice of partner; the narrator explicitly states that Agamemnon was afraid for his brother Menelaos (see 10.237–240). In the <em>Odyssey</em>, however, Menelaos is portrayed as an ambusher: he is inside the Trojan Horse with Diomedes and Odysseus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.280), he is one of the leaders of the night mission Odysseus describes to Eumaios (<em>Odyssey</em> 14.470–471), and he successfully ambushes Proteus (<em>Odyssey</em> 4.388–463; see above on pp. 72–73 for more on this ambush).</p>
