<p>Anthony Edwards (1985:22) identifies two leaders as a common feature of the Homeric ambush, and so Diomedes’ request for a partner may already indicate that the spying mission that Nestor proposed will become an ambush. Robert Rabel (1991, see esp. 288–291) sees an emphasis in <em>Iliad</em> 10 on cooperation among heroes in order to achieve success that contrasts strongly with Achilles’ choice to “go it alone” in <em>Iliad</em> 9. In Diomedes’ description of the ideal night raid team, νόος and νοέω are cited three times in three lines, together with μῆτις (cf. <em>Iliad</em> 23.590). It is no surprise, therefore, that he chooses Odysseus. For Odysseus’ association with <em>mētis</em> and <em>noos,</em> see on 10.137 and 10.247, respectively. </p>
