<p>ποικίλον ἀμφ᾽ ὤμοισι σάκος θέτο</p><p>Agamemnon and Diomedes each wear a lion skin, Menelaos wears a leopard skin, Nestor wears a <em>khiton</em> and <em>khlaina</em>, and all take a weapon (<em>egkhos</em> or <em>doru</em>), but Odysseus takes only a shield and leaves without putting on any outerwear of any kind. This seemingly mundane detail actually serves two significant narrative functions. First and foremost, it sets up the extended arming scene that takes place at the assembly, just before the raid itself (see below on 10.254–272). Odysseus’ lack of appropriate gear here means that he will have to borrow armor at the assembly. Second, Odysseus’ lack of an animal skin has an intriguing corollary the Odyssey, where, in one of his Cretan lies to Eumaios in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, Odysseus comes close to revealing his true identity, at least from the perspective of a traditional audience of epic. Odysseus describes how once on a cold night at Troy he went out on an ambush. All the other heroes were dressed for the weather, but he himself had no cloak, and had to come up with a clever scheme to get one from one of his companions on the lokhos. Odysseus’ Cretan lie may well be playfully alluding to a Doloneia tradition, in which case the story is a coded verbal message (<em>ainos</em>) directed at both the internal audience (Eumaios) and the external audience, who will “get” the inside reference. Such a reference is possible if we understand the <em>Iliad</em> (including the Doloneia) and Odyssey to be co-existing oral traditions, evolving in conjunction with one another. (On the <em>ainos</em> as a coded verbal message in <em>Odyssey</em> 14, see both Muellner 1976:97 and Nagy 1979:234–237, with further reference <em>ad loc.</em>) On the multiple significances of the shield being “intricately patterned” (<em>poikilos</em>), see above on 10.30.   </p>
