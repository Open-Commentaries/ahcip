<p>At the very beginning of the Iliadic text of Rhapsody 10, we find an interesting claim in the accompanying annotations known as the T Scholia, which stem from Homeric research ongoing in the ancient world. According to that claim, this <em>rhapsōidíā</em> had been composed by Homer separately, not as part of the <em>Iliad</em>, and the separate composition was later arranged, <em>tetákhthai</em>, by Peisistratos to fit into the <em>Iliad</em>. Such a sense of separateness in the content of Rhapsody 10—a separateness already noted, as we have just seen, in the ancient world—is due at least in part to a single basic fact: <em>the actions of heroes here take place at night, not in the daytime</em>. The tactics and even the ethics of nighttime warfare are in many ways different from the protocols of daytime warfare as narrated in the rest of the <em>Iliad</em>, and the differences are traced in the commentary of Dué and Ebbott 2010. And I would add that there are cognate patterns of nighttime warfare in Iranian epic traditions: see Davidson 2013:95–97 (for relevant observations on the figure of Dolon in Rhapsody 10 of the <em>Iliad</em>, see also Davidson 1979). As for the ancient claim that Rhapsody 10 was supposedly inserted into a pre-existing series of 23 rhapsodies, I have serious problems even with the chronology of such a claim. Whereas Peisistratos of Athens lived in the sixth century BCE, the division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> each into 24 performance-units or <em>rhapsōidiai</em> can now plausibly be dated as far back as the late eighth and early seventh century BCE: see Nagy <em>Classical Inquiries </em>2015.12.24 following Frame 2009 ch. 11. My view here supersedes an earlier view of mine as noted in <em>Poetry as Performance</em> 181–182, where I considered the era of Demetrius of Phaleron, late fourth century BCE, as a possible setting for the division of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> into 24 <em>rhapsōidiai</em>.</p>
