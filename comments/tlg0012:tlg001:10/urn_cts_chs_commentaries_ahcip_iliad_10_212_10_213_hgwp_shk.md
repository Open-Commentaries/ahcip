<p>Nestor is speaking to the assembled Achaean chieftains about a spying mission to be undertaken by a volunteer Achaean: whoever succeeds in accomplishing such a mission will have <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ because he will be remembered and named in a song of praise that will be sung about him, I.10.212, and such a song will be sung <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em> ‘throughout humankind’, I.10.21.  </p>
