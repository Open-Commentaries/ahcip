<p>ἕως ὃ ταῦθ᾽ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα, τόφρα δ᾽ Ἀθήνη</p><p>This line is formulaically similar to the first four feet of <em>Iliad</em> 1.193 and the last two feet of <em>Iliad</em> 1.194 (ἧος ὃ ταῦθ’ ὥρμαινε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν, / ἕλκετο δ’ ἐκ κολεοῖο μέγα ξίφος, ἦλθε δ’ Ἀθήνη) and thus may be considered a slightly more compressed version of Athena’s appearance to a hero who is deciding on a course of action. This is a more specific form of the type scene of “pondering options” (see 10.503) and scenes in which a decision must be made between two options, of which there are several examples in the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. We can compare also <em>Iliad</em> 5.671 (μερμήριξε δ’ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν) where it is Odysseus who is divided and then Athena directs his <em>thumos</em>. Stagakis (1986:237–239) argues that the situation here is parallel to that in <em>Iliad</em> 1, when Athena appears to a pondering Achilles and offers an option different from the two the hero had been contemplating. Just as Athena’s suggestion to Achilles to insult Agamemnon with words (<em>Iliad</em> 1.211) is related to his previously considered option of checking his fury (<em>Iliad</em> 1.192), so also may Athena’s command to remember their <em>nostos</em> here be related to the previously considered option of taking the chariot, if we understand that Diomedes does take the chariot for their getaway. For more on Athena’s role in this ambush, see our commentary on 10.285, 10.482, and 10.497.  </p>
