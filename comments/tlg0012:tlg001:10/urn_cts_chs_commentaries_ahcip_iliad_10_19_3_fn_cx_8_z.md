<p>μῆτιν  </p><p>The plan that Agamemnon hopes Nestor will construct is called simply <em>mētis</em>. In <em>Iliad</em> 9.423, Achilles had in fact advised the Achaeans to come up with a “better <em>mētis</em>” (μῆτιν ἀμείνω), since he was not going to accept Agamemnon’s offer. The plan that Nestor devises is to send someone on a nighttime spying expedition. Night raids and ambush warfare are linked in the epic tradition by their use of cunning or trickery (<em>mētis</em>) and endurance of prolonged hardship as opposed to the outright brute force (<em>biē</em>) of the battlefield (Edwards 1985:18 and above, “The Poetics of Ambush”). Many of the ambushes that are mentioned in epic occur at night: see e.g. <em>Iliad</em> 21.34–39 and <em>Odyssey</em> 14.468–503. Diomedes will be the hero who volunteers for this particular raid (10.219ff.), and he chooses as his companion Odysseus (10.243), the hero of <em>mētis</em>-style warfare. (For more on the relationship between Diomedes and Odysseus, see below on 10.243.) </p>
