<p>ποικίλῃ  </p><p>The leopard skin is further described as <em>poikilos</em>, which in this case has meaning for its physical qualities: the spotted pattern makes it “intricate.” But, as we saw with the wide semantic range of <em>pukinos</em>, which joins many concepts that might seem quite disparate at first to us, so also in the case of <em>poikilos</em> there is another important meaning here. As Detienne and Vernant (1974/1978) have shown, there is an association of this word with <em>mētis</em> and with trickery (“la ruse”). In this way, too, the leopard skin in particular shares common associations with ambush. For more on <em>mētis</em> and ambush, see above on 10.19 and below on 10.43–44.</p>
