<p>ἢ κεμάδ᾽ ἠὲ λαγωὸν</p><p>Providing alternative possibilities is a traditional feature of Homeric similes (Muellner 1990:62–64). κέμας is a <em>hapax legomenon</em>, but λαγωός appears in two other contexts, both related to this one in different ways. It appears in another simile, as Hektor swoops at Achilles like an eagle at a lamb or a hare (<em>Iliad</em> 22.308–310, note here also the alternatives for the prey). We can compare also the hunting dog simile at <em>Iliad</em> 22.188–193 as Achilles pursues Hektor. As we will see further at 10.363–368, this scene shares language in common with <em>Iliad</em> 22; so also in these two similes, the object of the chase or attack in both places can be a hare. The other place we see a similar alternation of the object of a hunting dog’s pursuit is in a description of an actual hunt rather than a simile: Odysseus’ dog Argos is described as having hunted wild goats and deer and hares (<em>Odyssey</em> 17.295) when he was younger.  </p>
