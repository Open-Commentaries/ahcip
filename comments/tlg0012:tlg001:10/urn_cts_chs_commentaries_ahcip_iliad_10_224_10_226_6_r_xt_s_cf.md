<p>In the wording of Diomedes here, it all comes down to the need for <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’ in the special sense of ‘taking the initiative’, as the verb is used at I.10.224 and at I.10.225, both times in conjunction with the related noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ at I.10.226. See also anchor comment at I.05.669 on: <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note (of), notice’.  </p>
