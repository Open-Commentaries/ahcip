<p>Διὸς τέκος Ἀτρυτώνη</p><p>As an epithet of Athena, Ἀτρυτώνη is used within the epic tradition for direct address: in our texts, she is addressed this way either by Hera (<em>Iliad</em> 2.157, 5.714, 21.420) or by a mortal praying to her (Diomedes here and at <em>Iliad</em> 5.115; Penelope at <em>Odyssey</em> 4.762; Odysseus at <em>Odyssey</em> 6.324). The Venetus A manuscript at <em>Iliad</em> 2.157 has a gloss written directly above this epithet that says “inexhaustible” (ἀκαταπόνητε). In all of these cases the name is part of an extended formula Διὸς τέκος Ἀτρυτώνη, and in all other instances besides this αἰγιόχοιο precedes Διὸς (see 10.278 for a use of the formula αἰγιόχοιο Διὸς τέκος without Ἀτρυτώνη). Thus the formula is one we see regularly throughout the epics, and it is therefore an example of the traditional nature of the language of <em>Iliad</em> 10. But should we find the absence of αἰγιόχοιο in this line evidence of nontraditional usage? We would argue no, since what actually seems to alter the compositional needs of this line is the fact that this is the second in a two-fold prayer to Athena (“Hear now <strong>also me</strong>”), which is not the case in the other attested examples.</p><p>Wherever this formula is used, Athena is reported as having listened to the prayers of the mortals who address her as such (see <em>Iliad</em> 5.121, <em>Iliad</em> 10.295, <em>Odyssey</em> 4.767, and <em>Odyssey</em> 6.328). When Hera addresses her with this epithet, Athena springs into action to do whatever Hera has asked after that initial address. Thus within the tradition it seems a particularly effective way to address the goddess in order to gain her attention. Formulas involving the gods are used especially in prayer contexts (Parry MHV 77–78, 181–182), and this one should be counted among them.  </p>
