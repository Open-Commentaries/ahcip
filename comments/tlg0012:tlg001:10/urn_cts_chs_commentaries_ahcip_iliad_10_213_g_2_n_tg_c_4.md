<p>occurrences of <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em> ‘throughout humankind’: I.10.213 (with <em>kléos</em> [κλέος] at I.10.212); I.24.202 (with <em>kleesthai</em> [ἔκλε(ο)] at the same verse); I.24.535 (with <em>kekasthai</em> [ἐκέκαστο] at the same verse); O.01.299 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at O.01.298); O.03.252 (in this context, the question is where Menelaos was wandering when Agamemnon was killed by Aigisthos: the question is about that story, but the word for ‘story’ or ‘song’ here is not made explicit); O.14.403 (with <em>eükleiē</em> [ἐϋκλείη] at O.14.402); O.19.334 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at O.19.333); O.23.125 (there is a reference here to the storied fame of the <em>mētis</em> ‘intelligence, mind’ of Odysseus, but the word for ‘fame’ here is not made explicit); O.26.094 (with <em>kleos</em> [κλέος] at the same verse); O.24.201 (with <em>aoidē</em> [ἀοιδή] ‘song’: here the song about Klytaimestra is not glorious but inglorious); <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 82 with <em>poluōnumos</em> [πολυώνυμος] at the same verse: the temple of Apollo will have great fame and thus it will be ‘having many names’]</p><p>The syntax of this expression <em>ep’ anthrōpous</em>, meaning ‘throughout humankind’, is unusual in Homeric diction, since there are no obvious parallels to be found for the combination of the preposition <em>epi</em>, ordinarily meaning ‘on’, with the accusative of <em>anthrōpoi</em> ‘humans’. Here and in other occurrences of this expression, what holds the syntax together, it appears, is the idea of a song that spreads the remembrance or even the fame and glory of a story throughout all of humanity. The anchor comment here at I.10.213 accounts for all the occurrences of this expression in Homeric diction.  </p>
