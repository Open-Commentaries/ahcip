<p>In this speech by Odysseus, words indicating good mental abilities, <em>pepnumenos</em>, ‘being in full possession of one’s senses’, ‘wise’ and <em>epētēs</em>, ‘courteous’, ‘gentle’, or, as Annette Dale argues, ‘very proficient in speech,’ are applied to Amphinomos, the noblest among the suitors. The first of these, <em>pepnumenos</em>, is often applied to Telemakhos to indicate his good sense (e.g. O.1.367, O.2.208, O.4.593), whereas <em>epētēs</em> is used in conjunction with adjectives pointing to good sense: <em>angkhinoos</em>, ‘ready of wit’, ‘shrewd’, and <em>ekhephrōn</em>, ‘sensible’, literally, ‘having <em>phrenes</em>’ – and all three are applied to Odysseus, a prime example of possessing a good mind (O.13.322, the only other occurrence of <em>epētēs</em> in Homer). Furthermore, <em>epētēs</em>, especially in the sense ‘very proficient in speech,’ ties in with Amphinomos’ description at O.16.397-398: that he is most pleasing to Penelope when it comes to speech (see also my comment at O.16.397). </p><p>In another passage illustrating Amphinomos’ positive difference from the rest of the suitors, he seconds Telemakhos’ reproach of the suitors’ riotousness at supper and suggestion it is time they go home (O.18.414-421). Amphinomos maintains that Telemakhos is right and proposes a libation before they head home - and here too, his ability at speaking plays a part: what he says is to all <em>ἑαδότα μῦθον</em>, “a pleasing speech” (O.18.422). His good sense not only leads to sensible speech, but his speech is effective, he can persuade his listeners: the suitors leave. So even in one of the suitors – the noblest one – we are shown the connection between good sense and speaking well, and that the first needed for the second.</p><p></p><p>See further:</p><p>Dale, Annette Teffeteller. 1982. “Homeric ἐπητής/ἐπητύς: Meaning and Etymology.” <em>Glotta </em>60:205-214.</p><p>Russo, Joseph, Manuel Fernández-Galiano, and Alfred Heubeck. 1992. <em>A Commentary on Homer’s </em>Odyssey, vol.
