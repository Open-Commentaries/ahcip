<p>Even before the physical combat between the disguised Odysseus and Iros takes place, Iros is already losing his nerve as he sees Odysseus half-revealed in the hero’s true form through the intervention of the goddess Athena, O.18.069–071. The reaction of the suitors is to start maliciously gloating over the fear shown by Iros, and the Master Narrator quotes here at O.18.073–074 what any one of the suitors might be saying as they gloat. And what the suitors say is already mocking Iros for failing to live up to his outward appearance of manly strength: the suitors are saying derisively that Iros is really unmanly, not manly. Just as the Master Narrator had previously said—and I highlighted this already in the comment at O.18.001–004—Iros may seem to be <em>megas</em> ‘great, big’ on the outside, O.18.004, but he is ridiculously weak on the inside: that is, he lacks the epic inner quality of īs ‘force, violence, strength’, O.18.003. This quality, so blatantly lacking in the character of Iros, is also indicated by way of the word <em>biē</em> at O.18.04, which means the same thing as does <em>īs</em> at O.18.03: ‘force, violence, strength’. The fear shown by Iros, leading to his defeat at the hands of Odysseus, proves that he really has no <em>īs</em>, no <em>bíē</em>. Accordingly, the suitors now call him <em>Á-īros</em>, O.18.073, which may be reconstructed as *<em>n̥-u̯īros</em> and glossed etymologically as ‘he who has no force = *<em>u̯īs</em>’. This form serves as a comic correction for what now emerges as the sarcastically misapplied meaning of the &quot;speaking name&quot; (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Îros</em> as *<em>u̯īros</em> ‘he who has force = *<em>u̯īs</em>’. Now we see that the form <em>Îros</em> seems is a play on an unattested Greek word *<em>u̯īros</em>, cognate with Latin <em>vīr</em> ‘man’, etc. The mocking name <em>Á-īros</em> O.18.073 explains the sarcasm built into the mocking name <em>Îros</em>. This mocking name <em>Îros</em> in the sense of *<em>u̯īros</em> ‘he who has *<em>u̯īs</em>’ is not incompatible with the likewise mocking association of Iros with Iris, the messenger of the gods, as analyzed in the comment at O.18.006–007: as I argued in that comment, the name <em>Îris</em> itself can be derived from the same root *<em>u̯ī</em>- as in <em>ī́s</em> ‘force, violence, strength’. </p>
