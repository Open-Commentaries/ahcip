<p>|1 ἦλθε δ᾽ ἐπὶ πτωχὸς πανδήμιος, ὃς κατὰ ἄστυ |2 πτωχεύεσκ᾽ Ἰθάκης, μετὰ δ᾽ ἔπρεπε γαστέρι μάργῃ |3 ἀζηχὲς φαγέμεν καὶ πιέμεν· οὐδέ οἱ ἦν ἲς |4 οὐδὲ βίη, εἶδος δὲ μάλα μέγας ἦν ὁράασθαι </p><p>|1 Then came a beggar [<em>ptōkhos</em>], ranging-all-over-the-district [<em>dēmos</em>], who all through the town [<em>astu</em>] |2 of Ithaca would go around begging. He stood out, with his gluttonous [<em>margē</em>] stomach, |3 because of his endless eating and drinking. And he had no <em>īs</em>, |4 nor <em>biē</em>, but in appearance he was big to look at.</p><p>Here I leave untranslated the synonyms <em>īs</em> and <em>biē</em>, both of which I had previously translated as ‘force, strength, violence’ in the note at O.18.001–117. As I already observed in that note, appearances here are deceiving: Iros looks strong on the outside but he is weak on the inside, and the exposure of his weakness will prove to be something that is ridiculed in epic. The act of ridiculing is the program, as it were, of mock epic, but here the mocking is reversed: now it is epic that will be mocking mock epic. As we are about to see, epic will overcome mock epic. Odysseus, even though he looks weak on the outside, will beat up on Iros, who looks strong on the outside. The mock epic form to which the epic refers here is signaled by a most telling word: it is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’, at O.18.002, describing the <em>gastēr</em> ‘stomach’ of Iros, who stands out as an ostentatiously greedy consumer of food and drink, O.18.002–003. A character who is <em>margos</em> is not just a negative example of lowly humans in general: in the poetic language of praise/blame, such a character is a negative example of lowly poets in particular. A lowly man who is <em>margos</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’ is to be seen generically as a greedy blame poet. Such a blame poet, as we will now see, is typical of a poetic form that I describe here as mock epic. We can see the formal features of such a poetic form at the very beginning of Rhapsody 18, where the wording matches in syntax the beginning of a mock epic known as the <em>Margites</em>. There the main character to be introduced on stage, as it were, is described not as a <em>ptōkhos</em> ‘beggar’, as here at O.18.001, but as a poet who turns out to be a blame poet. I show here the actual wording that we find at the beginning of that mock epic (<em>Margites</em> F 1 ed. West):</p><p>|1 ἦλθέ τις ἐς Κολοφῶνα γέρων καὶ θεῖος ἀοιδός, |2 Μουσάων θεράπων καὶ ἑκηβόλου Ἀπόλλωνος, |3 φίλῃς ἔχων ἐν χερσὶν εὔφθογγον λύρην</p><p>|1 Then came to Colophon some man, an old man, a divine [<em>theios</em>] singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |2 surrogate [<em>therapōn</em>] of the Muses and of Apollo who shoots from afar, |3 and in his hands, those hands of his, he held a lyre that made a beautiful sound.</p><p>As we see from the explicit description here, Margites is an <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’: that is, he is a poet. Moreover, he is a blame poet, as we see even from the morphology of his name <em>Margī́tēs</em>, derived from the adjective <em>margós</em> ‘gluttonous, wanton’. This “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Margī́tēs</em> is morphologically parallel to another &quot;speaking name,&quot; <em>Thersī́tēs</em>, which means &#x27;the bold one&#x27; (tharsos/thersos is &#x27;boldness&#x27; in negative contexts of blame poetry). This character named Thersites is represented in the <em>Iliad</em> as a blame poet of the worst kind: see the comments at I.02.214, I.02.216, I.02.217–219, I.02.221, I.02.222, I.02.224, I.02.225–242, I.02.235, I.02.241–242, I.02.243, I.02.245, I.02.246–264, I.02.246, I.02.247, I.02.248–249, I.02.251, I.02.255, I.02.256, I.02.265–268, I.02.269–270, I.02.275, I.02.277. In the narrative about Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, as I pointed out in my comments on the verses I just listed, it is clear that blame poetry is antithetical not only to praise poetry but also to epic, and that epic has the power to blame, in its own right, this blame poetry. Thus, epic can defeat blame poetry, making it an object of ridicule just as blame poets attempt to make epic an object of ridicule. When Odysseus beats up on Thersites in the <em>Iliad</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry. Similarly, when Odysseus beats up on Iros in the <em>Odyssey</em>, epic is defeating blame poetry and, further, epic is also defeating mock epic. In the case of the <em>Margites</em>, this mock epic starts off mock seriously by describing the poet simply as a poet, though the he will turn out to be a blame poet as the narrative proceeds. The metrical form of such mock epic is a combination of two kinds of verses: (1) dactylic hexameters, which are the medium of epic, and (2) iambic trimeters, which had once been the medium of mock poetry in general—the word for which is <em>iambos</em> (BA 243–252). A case in point is what we find in the attested fragments of the <em>Margites</em>: in the three verses of this poem’s beginning, already quoted above, the first two verses are dactylic hexameters, to be contrasted with the third verse, which is an iambic trimeter (Nagy 2015.10.15 §§28–29). At a later point in this same fragmentary poem, we see other such iambic trimeters, the most notable example of which is this verse (<em>Margites</em> F 201.1 ed. West F 4b.1):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>The same verse is attested in a fable, “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” which is embedded in blame poetry attributed to Archilochus (F 201.1 ed. West):</p><p>πόλλ’ οἶδ’ ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ’ ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα.</p><p>The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.</p><p>Such uses of fables in both poetry and prose are suitable for praising or for blaming or simply for warning (BA 280–288; Nagy 2011a §§6–7, 129, 138–146). In the case of “The Fox and the Hedgehog,” Fable 427 (ed. Perry), there is such an element of warning attested in a version attributed to Aesop by Aristotle <em>Rhetoric</em> 2.1393b22–1394a1, who reports that this fable was narrated by Aesop to the people of Samos on the occasion of their impending execution of a ‘demagogue’. [[GN 2017.07.20.]]</p><p>Addendum:</p><p>In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b24–34, Aristotle reconstructs an early phase of praise poetry and blame poetry where praise evolves into epic, as exemplified by the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, while blame evolves into the poetry of playful ridicule, as exemplified by the mock epic <em>Margites</em>, which Aristotle actually attributes to Homer. In <em>Poetics</em> 1448b34–1449a6, Aristotle goes on to argue that the poetry of epic evolved further into tragedy while the poetry of playful ridicule evolved further into comedy (additional comments in Nagy 2015.10.15 §§15–16). In terms of Aristotle’s terminology, then the mock epic <em>Margites</em> can be described as a hybrid form of comedy. [[GN 2017.07.20.]] </p>
