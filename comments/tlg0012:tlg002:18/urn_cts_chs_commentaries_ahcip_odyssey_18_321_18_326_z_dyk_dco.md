<p>The insults hurled by Melantho at the disguised Odysseus are replete with words indicating the language of blame poetry. For <em>aiskhro</em>- ‘disgraceful, shameful’, see the comments at I.02.216, I.03.038, I.06.325. For <em>oneideio</em>- ‘insulting’, see the comments on <em>oneidos</em> (plural <em>oneidea</em>) ‘words of insult’ at I.01.291, I.02.222, I.03.242, I.20.244–256. As for <em>eniptein</em> ‘scold’ at O.18.321 and O.18.326, it applies not only to unrighteous blame, as here, but also to righteous blame, as when Penelope scolds Antinoos at O.16.417.  </p>
