<p>When Iros ‘quarrels with’ Odysseus, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> here at O.18.009, he is acting as a blame poet who is hostile not only to Odysseus but also to the epic of the <em>Odyssey</em>. See the comment at I.02.221, where <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ refers to the blame that Thersites aims at both Achilles and Odysseus, the main heroes of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em> respectively. On blame as blame poetry, see the comment at O.18.001–004.  </p>
