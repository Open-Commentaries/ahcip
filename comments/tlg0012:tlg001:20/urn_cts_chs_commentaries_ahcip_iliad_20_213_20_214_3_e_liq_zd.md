<p>The use of the verb <em>eidénai</em> ‘know’ in both verses here at I.20.213–214 is relevant to the poetics of knowing something by way of hearing the authoritative testimony of epic. There is a reference to such poetics already earlier at I.20.203, where <em>eidénai</em> ‘know’ refers to knowing the facts of genealogy by way of hearing <em>epea</em> as ‘epic’, described at I.20.204. On this point, see the general comment on the speech of Aeneas at I.20.200–258. And the basic fact about that entire speech of Aeneas is a fact of genealogy. As we saw in the comment on I.20.209, Aeneas is making a most solemn heroic boast, signaled by the word <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘claim’, that he is the son of the goddess Aphrodite herself.  </p>
