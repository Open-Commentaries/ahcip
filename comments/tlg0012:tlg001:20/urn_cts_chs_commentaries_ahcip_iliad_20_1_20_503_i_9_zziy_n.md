<p>By now Achilles has a new set of armor, and he is ready to fight the Trojans. But his first major opponent seems to be a distraction. At least, our initial impression may lead us to think that there is a distraction going on here. The first major opponent of Achilles in <em>Iliad</em> 20 is Aeneas, hero of epic traditions that eventually became absorbed into the <em>Aeneid</em> of Virgil. Is this hero, we may ask, a truly worthy opponent of Achilles? Are the epic traditions that figure this son of Aphrodite / Venus truly worthy of the epic that is the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>? Once we examine more closely the oldest Greek epic traditions of Aeneas, it will become clear that this hero is indeed a most important opponent of Achilles, in that he represents ancient Greek epic traditions that are different from and antithetical to the epic tradition that prevailed in the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> as we know it. Not only does Aeneas challenge Achilles: even the epic traditions that figure Aeneas will challenge the epic traditions that figure Achilles. To say it another way, Aeneas represents a proto-Aeneid that challenges the proto-Iliad of Achilles. What makes Aeneas and his Aeneid—or, better, Aeneids—such a formidable challenge to Achilles is the enormous political prestige of the epic tradition that backs up Aeneas. By virtue of being the son of Aphrodite/Venus, Aeneas possesses a genealogical and dynastic charisma that threatens to overshadow the purely epic charisma of his Iliadic opponent Achilles.  </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Luca_Ferrari_-_Venus_preventing_her_son_Aeneas_from_killing_Helen_of_Troy_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Venus preventing her son Aeneas from killing Helen of Troy,” Luca Ferrari, circa 1650. <br/>Luca Ferrari [Public domain], via <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Luca_Ferrari_-_Venus_preventing_her_son_Aeneas_from_killing_Helen_of_Troy_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a><u><a>.</a></u></p>
