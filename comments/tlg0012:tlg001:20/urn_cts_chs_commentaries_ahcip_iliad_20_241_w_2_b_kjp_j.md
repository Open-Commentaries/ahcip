<p>In boasting about his own genealogy, the hero Aeneas started the boast by signaling it with the verb <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’ at I.20.209, thus making a most definitive epic statement of identity. Now that the genealogy is completed at I.20.241, the verb <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’ recurs, indicating by way of ring-composition the simultaneous completion of the boast. For more on the semantics of boasting as signaled by <em>eukhesthai</em> ‘declare’, see Muellner 1976. </p>
