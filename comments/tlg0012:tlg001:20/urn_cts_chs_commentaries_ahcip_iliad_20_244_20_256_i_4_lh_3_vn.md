<p>As noted in the general comment on I.20.200–258, Aeneas uses the noun <em>neikea</em>, plural of <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’, in referring to the mutual negativity that he and Achilles are expressing in their speeches to and about each other. Also used in the same context is the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.20.252 and I.20.254. On the noun <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ and the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ as programmatic markers of blame poetry, see especially the comments on I.02.221, I.03.059, I.03.100, I.10.249–253. Yet another word that is used in the same context here at I.20.244–256 is the noun <em>oneidea</em>, plural of <em>oneidos</em> ‘words of insult’, at I.20.244. On this word, see the comments on I.02.222.  </p>
