<p>This phrase about the good mental abilities of a character is here used of Amphinomos, the suitor who appears to be the least rotten of the lot. His better qualities are further brought out in this passage by mentioning that he pleases Penelope the most with words (<em>μύθοισι</em>; O.16.397-398) and that he thinks well (<em>ἐῢ φρονέων</em>, O.16.399), in both cases vocabulary we can see elsewhere in the <em>Odyssey</em>to connect with a good mind and memory. The same formulaic phrase <em>φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ&#x27; ἀγαθῇσιν</em>, “for he had good <em>phrenes</em>,” is used of Eumaios and his unforgetful, unfailing observance of the gods (O.14.420-421): the formula indicates the connection between good memory, good <em>phrenes</em>, and respect of the cosmic order. Sharing this formulaic description with Odysseus’ exemplarily upright swineherd, Amphinomos appears to be of this more mindful sort, too. This characterisation is furthermore supported by Amphinomos’ deference to the gods’ will (O.16.402-403). Elsewhere, his exceptionality among the suitors is brought out in his treatment of Odysseus disguised as a beggar (O.18.122-123): he is deferential and kind when all others insult Odysseus.</p>
