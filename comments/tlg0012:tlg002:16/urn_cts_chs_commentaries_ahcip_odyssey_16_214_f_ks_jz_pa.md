<p>The image of ‘pouring all over’ someone whom you are embracing, as expressed here by way of the verb <em>amphi-khu-</em>, extends from the idea of <em>dissolving in tears</em>: when you are weeping, pouring out your tears from your eyes, it is as if your whole self were dissoving into tears, which can then ‘pour all over’ that beloved someone whom you are embracing. The metaphor of dissolving while weeping, as here, can also be found at O.08.527. See also the comment at O.19.204–212.  </p>
