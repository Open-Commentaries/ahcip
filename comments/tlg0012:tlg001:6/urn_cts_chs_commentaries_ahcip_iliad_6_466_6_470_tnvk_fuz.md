<p>The “great floating horsetail crested helmet” worn by Hector frightens his child when he first tries to embrace him: I follow here the incisive observation of Vermeule 1987:146. This wistful detail can be dated back to a world otherwise long forgotten, if Vermeule is right in saying that this kind of helmet went out of production sometime around the middle of the second millennium BCE.  </p>
