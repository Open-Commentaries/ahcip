<p>lemmatizing: <u>δακρυόεν γελάσασα</u></p><p>As Andromache watches her husband Hector embracing their child and then giving him back into her arms, she ‘smiles through her tears’, or, more literally, she ‘smiles a smile that is tearful’. This weak smile carries over from I.06.471, where both father and mother smile when their child is frightened by the helmet of Hector.</p>
