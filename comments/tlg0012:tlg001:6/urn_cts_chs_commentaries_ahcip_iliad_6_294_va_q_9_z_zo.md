<p>The noun <em>poikilma</em> at I.06.294 refers to ‘pattern-weaving’ in a concrete and not an abstract sense: so, ‘pattern-woven thing’. The ‘pattern-woven things’ here are the <em>peploi</em> ‘robes’ described by the adjective <em>pan-poikilo</em>- ‘completely pattern-woven’ at I.06.289. These words <em>pan-poikilos </em>and <em>poikilma</em>, which refer to the peplos ‘robe’ that is being chosen for Athena, convey not only the general idea of <em>variation</em>, which is relevant to the variability of the wording that describes the ritual of presenting the <em>peplos</em> to Athena. More than that, they convey also the specific idea of pattern-weaving a picture into a fabric. Such a picture was pattern-woven into the Panathenaic Peplos of Athena. See the comment on I.05.734–735. The adjective <em>pan-poikilos</em> ‘completely pattern-woven’ is the epithet of the Panathenaic Peplos (scholia for Aristophanes <em>Birds</em> 827), and the noun <em>poikilma</em> designates the pattern-weaving of the charter myth of the Gigantomachy into the Panathenaic Peplos (Plato <em>Euthyphro</em> 6b-c).  </p>
