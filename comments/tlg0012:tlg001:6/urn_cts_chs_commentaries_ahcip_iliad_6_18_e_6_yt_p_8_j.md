<p>The hero Kalēsios is identified here at I.06.018 as the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’ of the hero Axulos, who is named at I.06.12–13. In the immediate context, at I.06.018, only the surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘attendant’ is evident. But Kalēsios is not only the <em>therapōn</em> of Axulos: he is also described at I.06.019 as the <em>hup- hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ of Axulos. This description of Kalēsios not only as a <em>therapōn</em> but also as a <em>hup- hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ points to the deeper meaning, ‘ritual substitute’, for <em>therapōn</em>.  </p>
