<p>Hector quarrels with Paris, as signaled by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’. He aims words of blame at Paris, and these words are <em>aiskhra</em> ‘disgraceful, shameful’ because they are meant to make Paris feel ashamed. Hector’s words are shaming, since he blames things done by Paris that are perceived as shameful and disgraceful.  </p>
