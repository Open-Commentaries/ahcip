<p>In contexts where the plural <em>therapontes</em> in combination with <em>Arēos</em> ‘of Ares’ is applied to the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives (at I.06.067, to the Danaoi) as a grouping of warriors, the deeper meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’ is more evident than in other contexts.  </p>
