<p>With each repetition of the wording for the presentation of the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Troy—from I.06.090–093 to I.06.271–273 to I.06.286–296—the master plan seems to fit more and more the ritual of presenting a pattern-woven <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena as goddess of Athens at the Athenian festival of the Panathenaia. On the Panathenaic Peplos, see again the comment on I.05.734–735; see also HPC 270. Looking back at the entire narrative sequence as analyzed here—I.06.090–093, I.06.271–273, I.06.286–296, I.06.297–310—I highlight two most salient visual details at Ι.06.297, namely, the citadel or acropolis of Troy and the temple on top of that acropolis. These two details correspond to the two most visible details distinguishing the city of Athens from most other cities. At work here is a process I describe as <em>split referencing</em>. The reference is split between Troy and Athens. The referent is both the prehistorical citadel of Troy and the historical citadel or acropolis of Athens. As for the narrative here at I.06.286-311 about the presentation of the <em>peplos</em> ‘robe’ to Athena, the <em>peplos</em> to be chosen is highlighted as the biggest of all the <em>peploi</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271, I.06.294). It is the <em>peplos</em> that is most ‘beautiful’ or <em>kalon</em> (I.06.294), with the most ‘pleasurable beauty’ or <em>kharis</em> (I.06.90, I.06.271). The size and the beauty of the fabric evoke a vision of the quadrennial Panathenaic Peplos, which is notionally the biggest and most beautiful of all imaginable <em>peploi</em>. As for the association of the word <em>kharis</em> ‘pleasurable beauty’ with the fabric, it is appropriate not only to the <em>peplos</em> that is being described but also to the medium that describes the <em>peplos</em>. That medium is Homeric poetry as performed at the quadrennial festival of the Panathenaia. The concept of <em>kharis</em> conveys the charisma of Homeric poetry as described by Homeric poetry. In terms of this description, the <em>peplos</em> in this narrative, I.06.286-311, can be seen as a metaphor for epic as performed at the Panathenaia. This epic is notionally the biggest and the most beautiful of all epics. Like the <em>peplos</em> that is being offered by the women to Athena, this epic as performed at the Panathenaia has more <em>kharis</em> than all other epics.  </p>
