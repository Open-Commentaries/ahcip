<p>The <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the goddess Athena, O.03.135, is provoked by a failure, on the part of some of the Argives=Achaeans, to be <em>dikaioi</em> ‘righteous’ and <em>noēmones</em> ‘mindful [= having <em>nóos</em>]’, O.03.133–134. The wording of Nestor is diplomatic in avoiding the mention of specific heroes as deserving blame for a failure in <em>dikē</em> ‘justice, righteousness’ and <em>nóos</em> ‘mind, mindfulness’. Among those heroes who are implicated, even without being named, as Odysseus himself, so that even this hero may be a target here of the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Athena. </p>
