<p>Nestor’s story about the <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ of the Achaeans’ is in and of itself a ‘song of / about homecoming’, as we see from the description of this <em>nostos</em> as <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’, an adjective that is used here as an epithet of the narrative subject. See the comment on O.01.326–327, where <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 is described as <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327. See also the comment on I.01.002, where the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’, describing <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the previous verse, I.01.001, is likewise an epithet of the narrative subject. In that case, the narrative subject is the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles. Similarly in the context of the ‘disastrous [<em>lugros</em>] homecoming [<em>nostos</em>]’ of the Achaeans here at O.03.130, there is a foregrounding of <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’, at O.03.135. In this case, the anger emanates from the goddess Athena herself.  </p>
