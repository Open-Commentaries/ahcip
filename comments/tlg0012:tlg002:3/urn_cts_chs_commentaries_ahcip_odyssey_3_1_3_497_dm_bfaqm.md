<p>Aided by the goddess Athena, young Telemachus becomes an ideal guest for his host, the elderly Nestor. Telemachus dearly needs the diplomatic skills of Athena, since Nestor is a prime devotee of the god Poseidon, who is not only a major rival of the goddess but also a relentless antagonist of Odysseus. Nestor’s stories about the travels of the Achaeans as they try to make their way back home after the Trojan War will help connect Telemachus with the ultimate story of his father’s own homecoming.</p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Tate_Flaxman_sacrifice.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Nestor’s Sacrifice (1805).
