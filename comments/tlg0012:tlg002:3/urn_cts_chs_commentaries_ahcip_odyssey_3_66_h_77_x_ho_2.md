<p>The derivation of the noun <em>dais</em> ‘feast; division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’ from the verb <em>daiesthai</em> ‘feast; divide (meat), apportion, distribute’ is re-enacted here by way of a <em>figura etymologica:</em> that is to say, the combination of the verb here with the noun as its direct object actually re-enacts the etymology. </p>
