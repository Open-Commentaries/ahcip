<p>As the cause of Athena’s <em>mēnis </em>here shows, besides failing to remember and therefore to act appropriately, failing to be νοήμων ‘thoughtful,’ ‘intelligent,’ ‘in possession of <em>noos</em> [mind]’ and δίκαιος ‘just’ can also lead to behavior that transgresses against the cosmic order. Words indicating mental qualities such as <em>noos</em>,<em> noēmōn </em>and <em>phrenes</em> are linked to the good kind of mindfulness and memory indicated by words such as <em>mimnēskomai</em>, and lack of them is associated with behavior that incurs <em>mēnis </em>(cp. I.15.128-129). In contrast to the Argives’ failures with respect to their minds and their subsequent punishment, a good mind is given as the reason for unfailing good conduct, for example Eumaios in his sacrifices to the gods on account of his good <em>phrenes</em> (O.14.420-421; cp. also O.24.194-195).</p>
