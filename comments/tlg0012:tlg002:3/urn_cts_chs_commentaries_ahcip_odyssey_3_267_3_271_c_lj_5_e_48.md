<p>The generic <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’, as represented by the anonymous figure who is mentioned here, has the power to supervise the deeds of men and women by way of praising what is good and blaming what is bad. The <em>aoidos</em> that Agamemnon left behind to supervise Clytemnestra cannot be neutralized by way of removal from the scene. The <em>aoidos</em> does not need to see bad deeds in order to tell about them, since he can hear about them from the Muses. </p>
