<p>Here is the first mention of Peisistratos, son of Nestor, in the <em>Odyssey</em>. (He is not mentioned in the <em>Iliad</em>.) It can be argued that this Peisistratos was claimed to be the ancestor of Peisistratidai, the lineage that dominated Athens in the sixth century BCE. On Peisistratos of Athens, see also I.10.000. </p>
