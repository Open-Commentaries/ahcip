<p>lemmatizing:<u> ἔλπομαι εὐχόμενος </u>vs. <u>εὔχομαι ἐλπόμενος</u></p><p>Aristarchus debated with Zenodotus of Ephesus (the debate is indicated by way of the sign ⸖ in front of the verse), who attested the variant ἔλπομαι εὐχόμενος.  (On the readings of Zenodotus as opposed by Aristarchus, see under <em>Zenodotus</em> and under <em>Aristarchus</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas.) Aristarchus preferred the variant εὔχομαι ἐλπόμενος, which has been transmitted in the medieval manuscript tradition. As Muellner 1976:58-62 shows, both variants can be justified on the basis of analyzing the formulaic system of Homeric diction.   </p>
