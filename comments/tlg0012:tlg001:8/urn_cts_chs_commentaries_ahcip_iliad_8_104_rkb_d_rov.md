<p>Diomedes is speaking to Nestor, saying that the old hero’s chariot driver, unnamed here, has lost his energy and usefulness. Diomedes refers to this driver here at I.01.321 as Nestor’s <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant’. In the immediate context, only the surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘attendant’ is evident. But this particular attendant is not only the <em>therapōn</em> of Nestor: in the overall context of I.08.076–117, it is also evident that this <em>therapōn</em> is in fact the designated chariot driver of Nestor, though the specific word hēni-okhos ‘chariot driver’ is not used here. The name of this driver is Eurymedon, as we see at I.08.114. He may or may not be the same hero Eurymedon as at I.04.227.  </p>
