<p>The constellation of words linked with <em>pulē</em> in the sense of ‘gate’, such as <em>pul-artēs</em> ‘gate-closer’ here (genitive πυλάρταο), is linked with the idea of the <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ of Hādēs. See the comments on I.05.395–404, I.05.646, I.11.671; see also Points 5 and 6 in the anchor comment at I.23.071–076.  </p>
