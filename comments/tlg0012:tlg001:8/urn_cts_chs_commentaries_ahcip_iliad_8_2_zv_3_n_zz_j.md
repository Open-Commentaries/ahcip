<p>This compound noun <em>terpi-kéraunos</em>, interpreted here as ‘he whose bolt strikes’, is an epithet that applies exclusively to Zeus: a parallel epithet, also applied exclusively to Zeus, is the compound noun <em>argi-kéraunos</em> at Ι.19.121, I.20.016, I.22.178, which can be interpreted to mean ‘he whose bolt shines’ (<em>Greek Mythology and Poetics </em>(<em>GMP</em>) 195). Both epithets fit Zeus in his role as a thunder-god. The second part of both compounds <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> and <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly derived from <em>keraunós</em> ‘thunder’, and the first part of <em>argi-kéraunos</em> is clearly related to <em>arg</em>‑<em>ós</em> (earlier *<em>argr</em>‑<em>ós</em>) ‘shining, speeding’, but the first part of <em>terpi-kéraunos</em> seems at first unclear. Related forms in other Indo-European languages, however, help elucidate the meaning of <em>terpi</em>‑ as combined with <em>keraunós</em>. In the case of <em>keraunós</em>, we find in the Baltic and Slavic branches of Indo-European the parallel forms <em>perkūnas</em> and <em>perunŭ</em> respectively, both of which are nouns meaning ‘thunder’ and/or ‘god of thunder’. Although the Greek and the Baltic/Slavic roots here, *<em>kerh₂(u̯)</em>‑ and *<em>per(kʷ)</em>‑ respectively, are different in form, they are parallel in meaning, ‘strike’, and the morphology of their suffixation is also parallel. (<em>GMP</em> 194–195). As for the <em>terpi</em>‑ of <em>terpi</em>‑<em>kéraunos</em>, we find a comparable form in the Italic branch of Indo-European: it is the Latin noun <em>quercus</em>, meaning ‘oak tree’. This form, it can be argued, refers to the defining sacred moment when a thunderbolt strikes an oak tree: here the root of the <em>u</em>-stem noun <em>quercus</em>, from *<em>perkʷu‑</em>, is *<em>perkʷ‑</em>, meaning ‘strike’ (<em>GMP</em> 186). So, <em>terpi‑kéraunos</em> can be derived from *<em>kʷerpi-kéraunos</em> via metathesis from *<em>perkʷi-kéraunos</em>.</p>
