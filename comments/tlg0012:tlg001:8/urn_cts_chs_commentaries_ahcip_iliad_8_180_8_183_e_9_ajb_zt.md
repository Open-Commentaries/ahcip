<p>Hector predicts that there will be <em>mnēmosunē</em> ‘memory’, I.08.181, of the moment when he will set fire to the beached ships of the Achaeans in the epic Battle for the Ships. And this moment will be in fact pivotal for the Will of Zeus, which will find expression in the fire of Hector. It will be a moment to be recorded by the poetic memory of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. See the comments on I.16.112 and on I.16.113.  </p>
