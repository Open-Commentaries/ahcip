<p>The hero Eniopeus son of Thebaios is here both the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ and the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Hector. When Diomedes throws his spear at Hector, it is Eniopeus who “takes the hit” instead, I.08.119–124. This detail is relevant to the fact, highlighted from the start, that Eniopeus is both the <em>hēni-okhos</em> ‘chariot driver’ and the <em>therapōn</em> ‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Hector, I.08.119. In this context, then, the deeper meaning of <em>therapōn</em> as ‘ritual substitute’ is overt. The narrative goes on to say that Hector is deeply saddened by the death of his chariot driver, but he leaves the corpse of Eniopeus where that hero fell: instead of trying to rescue the corpse, Hector decides to fight on and immediately proceeds to select a new chariot driver, I.08.124–129, whose name is Arkheptolemos, I.08.128.  </p>
