<p>The gods pity Hector and are on the verge of sending Hermes to hide the corpse of Hector, but this plan is vetoed by Hērā and Poseidon, in that order. They bear a grudge against Troy and Priam because of an <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ of Paris=Alexandros. But the narrative concentrates only on Hērā, since the <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that the Master Narrator has in mind involves a direct insult to that goddess. On the story of that insult, see the comment on the verses that immediately follow.  </p>
