<p>In the story about the Judgment of Paris, as we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em>, Proclus 102.14–19 (ed. Allen 1912), Paris=Alexandros has to choose from among three goddesses, Hērā, Athena, and Aphrodite, <em>Cypria</em>/Proclus 102.14–19. Which of the three is supreme? Paris chooses Aphrodite, who rewards him by arranging his love affair with Helen. The story of the Judgment of Paris is recapitulated, in a most compressed form, here at I.24.025–030. And the story is told in terms of a contrast between positive and negative words. The fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽). As noted in the comment on I.03.100, the verbs <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ express both the social and the poetic significance of praise and blame respectively.  </p>
