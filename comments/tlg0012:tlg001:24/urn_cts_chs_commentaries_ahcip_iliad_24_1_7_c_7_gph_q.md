<p>The <em>agōn</em> ‘competition’, that is, the ‘coming together’ for the sake of competition, is now over. Or, to say it in Greek, the coming-together is now undone, as expressed by the verb <em>luein</em> ‘undo’. Now all the participants disperse, returning to their beached ships. See the comment on I.23.257–258.  </p>
