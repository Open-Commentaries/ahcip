<p>In the speech of Hērā here, Ι.24.055–063, there is a reference to a primal story that is connected to the Judgment of Paris. It is the story about the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the mortal and immortal parents-to-be of Achilles. As we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria </em>in Proclus 102.13–19 (ed. Allen 1912), there was <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at the <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ celebrating the marriage of Thetis and Peleus. It was the Will of Zeus that <em>Eris</em> ‘Strife’ personified would bring about a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ among the gods that would ultimately result in the Trojan War (Proclus 102.14/15 on <em>Eris</em>/<em>neikos</em>). Hērā notes that even Apollo attended the wedding, singing at the feast, Ι.24.062–063.</p>
