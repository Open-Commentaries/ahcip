<p>Once again, divine intervention prevents the disfigurement of Hector’s body. The intervention starts starts midline at I.24.018, and the narrative of the intervention extends through I.24.018: the god Apollo will not allow any <em>aeikeiē</em> ‘unseemliness’ to happen to the body of Hector, I.24.019. Apollo focuses here on Hector’s <em>khrōs</em> ‘complexion’, I.24.019, worrying that the hero’s skin will be grotesquely scraped away by the harsh surface over which it is being dragged behind the speeding chariot of Achilles, I.24.021. This time, the protective covering that is granted by the gods is not an enveloping glow, as it was at I.23.188–191 (see the anchor comment at I.23.184–191), but rather a mystical <em>aigis</em> ‘skin-shield’, I.24.020. Then, at I.24.022, by way of ring-composition, the thinking returns to the horrors of mutilation by way of ‘disfiguring’ the body, as expressed here by the verb <em>aeikizein</em>. But the disfigurement is canceled. Once again, the body is saved. See again the anchor comment at I.23.184–191, where the vision of salvation for Hector’s body is fully analyzed.  </p>
