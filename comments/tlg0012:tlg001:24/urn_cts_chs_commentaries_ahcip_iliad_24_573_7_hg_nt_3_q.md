<p>The two heroes Automedon and Alkimos are both marked as <em>therapontes</em> of Achilles, I.24.573, by virtue of this detail: Achilles honored the two of them more than anyone else after the death of Patroklos, I.24.574–575 (<em>tīein</em> ‘honor’ at I.24.575). Here they are acting as the attendants of Achilles, I.24.576–580.  </p>
