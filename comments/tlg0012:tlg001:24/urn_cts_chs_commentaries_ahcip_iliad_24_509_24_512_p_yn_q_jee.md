<p>While Priam mourns for his own son Hector, Achilles alternates in mourning for his own father Priam and for Patroklos as his own other self. By mourning for both his father and for Patroklos, Achilles shows the way—showing how to mourn for ancestors. <em>Do as I do</em>. Relevant is what the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of Patroklos means: ‘he who has the glory [<em>kleos</em>] of the ancestors [<em>pateres</em>]’. See the comments on I.01.345, I.06.209, I.09.185–191. Such a meaning signals the basic fact that one’s father is one’s most immediate ancestor. The <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of Achilles is thus linked, for all time to come, with a poetic glory that originates from the ancestors.  </p>
