<p>In the first of the three laments performed by Andromache, as quoted by the Master Narrator at I.06.407–439, she is already lamenting the death of Hector before he is even dead. As for the second lament, as quoted at I.22.476–515, she sings it when she sees the corpse of Hector for the first time. As for her third lament, here at I.24.723–746, she sings it on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. As Andromache starts her song of lament at I.24.723, the verb <em>arkhein</em> in the sense of ‘lead off [in performing]’ signals that she is leading off as a lead singer, and the song that she sings is called here a <em>góos</em> ‘lament’. Then, as Andromache finishes her lead song at I.24.746, the women of Troy sing an antiphonal refrain as signaled by the verb <em>epi-stenakhizesthai </em>‘wail in response’.
