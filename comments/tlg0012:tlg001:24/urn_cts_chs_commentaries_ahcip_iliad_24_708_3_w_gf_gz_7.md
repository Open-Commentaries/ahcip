<p>The word <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ here at I.24.708 refers to the context for performing laments, I.24.720–776, on the occasion of Hector’s funeral. The word recurs in the actual words of the lament sung by Andromache at Ι.24.741, where she says that Hector, by dying, has caused <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ and <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ for his parents.  </p>
