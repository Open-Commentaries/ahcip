<p>The <em>Iliad</em> ends with the funeral of Hector, not of Achilles. And it is Hector, not Achilles, who is lamented at the end. But it is Achilles who makes it all happen, since he has transcended his rage and has shown mercy to an old father. The tears of Priam had made Achilles think of his own old father, of his own ancestors—and of Patroklos, who embodied the glories of the ancestors. Achilles was looking bad at the beginning of <em>Iliad </em>23 and even at the beginning of <em>Iliad</em> 24, but he looks very good by the time <em>Iliad</em> 24 comes to a close.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/34_Flaxman_Ilias_1793_gestochen_1795_184_x_346_mm_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Mourners lament as Hector’s corpse is laid out in preparation for the funeral that closes <em>Iliad</em> Rhapsody 24.
