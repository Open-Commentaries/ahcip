<p>See also anchor comment at I.23.184–194.</p><p>[epitome from HC 4§267]</p><p>The focus of the <em>Iliad</em> on Hector as the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> is evident at the conclusion of this epic. The <em>Iliad</em> as we know it ends with the funeral of Hector, not of Achilles. It is Hector, not Achilles, who is lamented at the end. Even the very last word of the <em>Iliad</em> as we have it is a signature for Hector: it is his ornamental epithet <em>hippodamos</em>, the ‘horse-tamer’, I.24.804 (Sacks 1987). So, the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> evolved in such a way as to highlight Hector as the primary point of interest in the poetics of terror and pity. To be contrasted is an alternative epic like the <em>Aithiopis</em>, attributed to Arctinus of Miletus, where the focus at the end is evidently on Achilles as the primary <em>beau mort</em>. Pindar’s reference to the dead Achilles in <em>Isthmian</em> 8 (56-60) alludes to this alternative epic tradition (PH 204–206). In the <em>Iliad</em>, the doomed figure of Hector has been substituted for the equally doomed figure of Achilles, who is the ultimate <em>beau mort</em> of epic. Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> prefigures Achilles as that ultimate <em>beau mort</em>. </p>
