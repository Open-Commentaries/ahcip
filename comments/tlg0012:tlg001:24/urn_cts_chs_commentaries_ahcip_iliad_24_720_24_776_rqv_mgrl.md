<p>The laments for Hector at his funeral can be divided into two main parts, the second of which can be subdivided into three sub-parts. The first main part is at I.24.720–722, where professional <em>aoidoi</em> ‘singers’ who are men, I.24.720, perform <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721; as they perform, the word that refers to their performance is <em>thrēneîn</em> ‘make lament’, I.24.722, which is a verb derived from the noun <em>thrēnos</em> ‘lament’. Following up on the laments performed by the professional singers are laments performed by the <em>gunaikes</em> ‘women’ of Troy, I.24.722. These women, as women singers, are of course non-professionals, and their role as singers is subordinated to the role of the professional singers, as we see from the use of the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’ at I.24.722 in referring to their performance. This act of wailing-in-response is treated here as an antiphonal complement to the singing of the professional singers, who are described as <em>ex-arkhoi</em> ‘lead singers’ of the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’ that they sing, I.24.721. By now we have reached the end of the narrative about the first main part of the laments performed at the funeral of Hector. Now the narrative about the second part of the laments can begin, and this part, as noted already, can be subdivided into three sub-parts. The Master Narrator now quotes, as it were, three laments, to be performed by Andromache at I.24.725–745, by Hecuba at I.24.748–759, and by Helen at I.24.762–775. But the two main parts in this overall scheme are not kept separate here, since the same women who sang at I.24.722 their responses to the laments sung by men who were lead singers will now perform responses to the three women who will now be singing their own laments, and these three will now be singing as lead singers in their own right, as expressed by the verb <em>arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> / <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ in the case of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 / I.24.761. These three singing women are not professionals, but nevertheless they hold positions of great social status, since they all belong to Hector’s immediate family: as family members, they sing a form of lament that qualifies as a <em>góos</em>, not as a <em>thrēnos</em>. This word <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ is applied to the singing of Andromache / Hecuba / Helen at I.24.723 / I.24.747 (also at I.24.760) / I. 24.761. Of these three, the most important performer of lament here is Andromache, since she gets to cradle the head of Hector from behind while she sings her song of lament over his corpse, I.24.724. The special importance of Andromache is also signaled by the fact that the verb <em>epi-stenakhesthai</em> ‘wail in response’, which had signaled at I.24.722 the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>thrēnoi</em> ‘laments’, I.24.721, that were sung by the professional lead singers, is also used at I.24.746 to signal the antiphonal singing of the women of Troy in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’, I.24.723, that is sung by Andromache as the non-professional lead singer. The general response at I.24.746 by the women of Troy to the lament of Andromache is an intensification of the more specific response at I.22.515 by the women who attended her when she previously sang her second lament, though the wording is exactly the same at I.24.746 as at I.22.515: ‘So she [= Andromache] spoke, and the women wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δὲ στενάχοντο γυναῖκες). An even more general response, however, occurs at I.24.776, where not just the women of Troy but the entire <em>dēmos</em> or ‘populace’ of the city joins the antiphonal singing, as signaled here by the verb <em>epi-stenein</em> ‘wail in response’: ‘So she [= Helen] spoke, and the vast populace [<em>dēmos</em>] wailed in response’ (ὣς ἔφατο κλαίουσ’, ἐπὶ δ’ ἔστενε δῆμος ἀπείρων). Now the whole community is lamenting in response to the <em>góos</em> ‘lament’ as re-started at I.24.761 by Helen as the last of the three women who sing here as lead singers.  </p>
