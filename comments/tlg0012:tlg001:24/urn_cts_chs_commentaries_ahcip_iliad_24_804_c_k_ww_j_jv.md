<p>[epitome from HC 4§268]</p><p>This foregrounding of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em> as we know it is a matter of politics as well as esthetics. The beautiful death of Hector, his <em>belle mort</em>, is for Athenians an expression of their empire. See the comment on I.15.494–499, where I made an epitome from HC 4§268. In what follows, I repeat the relevant parts of that epitome. The Athenian statesman Lycurgus says it best when he refers to the willingness of Athenian citizens to die in war not only for their own <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ but also for all of Hellas as a <em>patris</em> ‘fatherland’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 104). Lycurgus invokes as his prime example the <em>belle mort</em> of the Athenian citizen-warriors who fought at Marathon and who thereby won for Hellas a freedom from terror, an <em>adeia</em> ‘security’ that is <em>koinē</em> ‘common’ to all Hellenes (104). The Athenian statesman is making this reference to the imperial interests of Athens in the context of actually quoting the words of Hector in the <em>Iliad</em>, who says that he is willing to die for his fatherland in order to protect it against the Achaeans (Lycurgus <em>Against</em> <em>Leokrates</em> 103 lines 4-9). These heroic words of Hector correspond to I.15.494–499, and Lycurgus quotes them in the larger Athenian festival of the context of saying that the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, as performed at the quadrennial Athenian festival of the Panathenaia, are the ancestral heritage of the Athenians and the primary source of their education as citizen-warriors (<em>Against Leokrates</em> 102). In this invocation of Homeric poetry as the most sublime expression of the Athenian empire, the statesman is quoting the words of a Trojan, not the words of an Achaean. It is the <em>belle</em> <em>mort</em> of Hector that motivates the Athenians to live up to the heroic legacy they learn from Homer. </p>
