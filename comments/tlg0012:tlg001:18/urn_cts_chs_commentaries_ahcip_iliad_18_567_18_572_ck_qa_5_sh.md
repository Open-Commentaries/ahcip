<p>After an extensive description of life in the countryside, I.18.541–566, the vision centers on occasions of festive celebration marking the successful completion of work on the land. Such celebration is figured as a festival featuring ‘song and dance’, <em>molpē</em>, I.18.572. The singers / dancers are <em>parthenikai</em> ‘young unmarried women’ and <em>ēïtheoi</em> ‘young unmarried men’ who have just completed the harvest, I.18.567. Taking the lead in the singing / dancing is a <em>pais</em> ‘boy’ positioned at the center of a group of celebrating singers / dancers, I.18.569. This leader of the song and dance is figured as accompanying himself on a string instrument while he ‘sings the song of Linus’, I.18.570. The whole group sings and dances in response to the leader of song and dance, I.18.571–572.  </p>
