<p>In this compressed pastoral scene, we see at I.18.589 three important words referring to places where herdsmen can shelter their herds: <em>stathmos</em> ‘station’; <em>klisiā</em> ‘shelter’; <em>sēkos</em> ‘enclosure’. In what follows, I epitomize from my analysis of these three words in HPC 152–153. All three of these words are applied here in the context of describing a generic pastoral setting. When we compare the etymologies of these three words with the contexts of their usage in other pastoral settings, we find that their reconstructed meanings are interrelated: <em>stathmos</em>, derived from the root <em>*sta-</em> meaning ‘stand up’, is the makeshift post of a herdsman’s shelter or tent; <em>klisiā</em>, derived from the root <em>*kli-</em> meaning ‘lie down’ or ‘lean’, is the space in the shelter where the herdsman reclines—or, alternatively, it is a ‘lean-to’ covering that affords a makeshift shelter; and <em>sēkos</em>, derived from the root <em>*sak-</em> meaning ‘fill [an empty space]’, is the enclosure where the herdsman’s herd is penned in. By way of metonymy, the <em>klisiā</em> is not only an aspect of the shelter but also the entire shelter; likewise, the <em>stathmos</em> is not only the post of the shelter but also the entire shelter and everything contiguous with the shelter, including the <em>sēkos</em>. In this sense, then, the <em>stathmos</em> is the herdsman’s ‘station’. The pastoral word <em>sēkos</em> refers not only to the enclosure where a herd is penned in but also to the enclosure where a cult hero is entombed and worshipped. And it can be argued that such sacral connotations are attached to the pastoral words klisiā and stathmos as well. All three words connote traditional images typical of cult heroes. In the <em>Iliad</em>, the word <em>klisiā</em> refers to the abode that a hero like Achilles frequents in life: his <em>klisiā</em> is his shelter, which marks the place where his ship is beached on the shores of the Hellespont during the Trojan War, as we see at I.08.224, I.11.007, and so on. See the comments on I.08.227–227 and on I.11.005–016. In later poetry we see a related use of <em>stathmos</em> (plural <em>stathma</em>) with reference to the places where the ships of Achaean heroes are beached on the shores of the Hellespont (“Euripides” Rhesus 43); these places are also called <em>naustathma</em> ‘ship stations’ (<em>Rhesus</em> 136, 244, 448, 582, 591, 602, 673). Among these <em>stathma</em> ‘stations’ lining the coast of the Hellespont is the heroic space occupied by Achilles.  </p>
