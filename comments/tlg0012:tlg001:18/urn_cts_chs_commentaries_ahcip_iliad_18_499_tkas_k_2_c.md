<p>The anonymous dead man whose life has been lost is described at I.18.499 as <em>apophthimenos</em> (ἀποφθιμένου), that is, as someone who ‘perished’. This reading comes from the base text once used by Aristarchus, but there was a variant reading <em>apoktamenos</em> ‘killed’ (ἀποκταμένου) in the base text used by Zenodotus. For the implications of such variation between the base texts of Aristarchus and Zenodotus, see the comment on I.18.483–608.</p>
