<p>Beginning at I.18.483 and ending at I.18.603 are the verses that actually narrate the images that are worked by the divine metalworker into the surface of the Shield of Achilles. So far in the comments on <em>Iliad</em> 18, I have not capitalized the first letter of the word referring to the Shield, since I have been viewing this object primarily as an object in the making. But now, as I begin to view this imagined object primarily as a narrative in the making, I write <em>Shield</em>, not shield. And I now apply the technical term <em>ecphrasis</em> to this core narrative, by which I mean <em>the narration of visual</em>—<em>or at least visualized</em>—<em>art by way of verbal art</em>. From the start, I find it most noteworthy to report what we learn from the testimony of the scholia A for I.18.483: that Zenodotus of Ephesus (see under <em>Zenodotus</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas) athetized this entire ecphrasis, that is, all the verses that narrated, by way of verbal art, the visual or at least visualized narrative of the Shield, I.18.483–608. (On <em>athetesis</em> and <em>athetizing</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas.) But Zenodotus retained these verses in the base text of his edition. (On <em>base text</em>, see the inventory of Words and Ideas). We know this from the fact that Aristarchus, in his edition of Homer, reported a variant textual reading that had been attested by Zenodotus in the case of one of these athetized verses, I.18.499. See the comment below on I.18.499. By contrast with Zenodotus, an editor like Crates of Mallos considered the entire narrative of the Shield to be an all-important part of the <em>Iliad</em> writ large: see the comment on I.18.478–609. </p>
