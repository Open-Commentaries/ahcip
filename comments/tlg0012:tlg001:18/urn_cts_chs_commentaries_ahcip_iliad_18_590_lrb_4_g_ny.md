<p>At I.18.479–480, we saw a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalworking and weaving. The metalwork of Hephaistos in manufacturing the Shield of Achilles was metaphorized as the pattern-weaving of fabric. There is a comparable crossover here at I.18.590, where the word <em>poikillein</em> ‘pattern-weave’ refers to the metalwork performed by the god Hephaistos in making the Shield of Achilles. Here I epitomize my relevant analysis in HC C§15, where I focus on a comparable crossover in the case of Virgil’s Shield of Aeneas in <em>Aeneid</em> 8. I start by focusing on <em>arma</em> ‘armor, arms’, which is the first word at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616. To be compared is the beginning of the epic, at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1: arma virumque cano ‘armor I sing, and the man’. When we read <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616, where the narrative refers to the <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ of Aeneas, the description of this hero’s Shield as a shield has not yet happened. So far, only the armor in general is being described. But there is more to it: the word <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ at Aeneid 8.616, by way of cross-referring to the initial use of <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1, stands metonymically for the whole epic, not only for the ‘armor’ of Aeneas. The <em>arma</em> ‘armor’ at the beginning of <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1 can apply at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616 if we understand the deployment of <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 1.1 as a masterstroke of metonymy. What is being signaled by the <em>arma</em> at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.616 is a description of the Shield that becomes coextensive with the overall narration of the epic that is the <em>Aeneid</em> in its entirety. But when the actual description of the Shield begins at <em>Aeneid</em> 8.625, the wording makes it clear that this description defies any immediate narration: clipei non enarrabile textum ‘the shield, the weaving [textus] of which is beyond all power to narrate’. To describe the cosmic power of the Shield’s meaning will require an overall epic narration, from beginning to end, which cannot be successful until the story is fully told. Such a narration calls for a metaphor to substitute for the narration: instead of a tale that is being told, the narration is reconfigured as a ‘web’ that is being woven, a textus. The story has to be told from beginning to end, just as a web has to be woven from beginning to end.  </p>
