<p>The cosmic river Ōkeanos is described here at I.18.399 as <em>apsorhoos</em> ‘backward-flowing’ (ἀψορρόου Ὠκεανοῖο). Since this river is visualized as flowing around the world in a circle, its flow always comes back to where it started. Since the flow comes back full circle, the Ōkeanos is ‘backward-flowing’.  </p>
