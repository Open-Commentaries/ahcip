<p>In the Homeric textual tradition, there are traces of a longer version of the narrative here, containing verses 603–604–605–606, to be contrasted with a shorter version containing 603–604–606. The shorter version, which was favored by the editor Aristarchus, elided the “signature” of Homer as analyzed in the comment on I.18.590–606. By contrast, the longer version highlights this “signature.” The shorter version is what was ultimately preserved in the medieval manuscripts of Homer, while the longer version was lost. But this longer version can be reconstructed by way of attestations that we find in a source that dates back to the late second century CE, Athenaeus 5.180c–e and 181a–f. The reconstructed longer version is as follows: ‘|603 A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [<em>khoros</em>] that rouses desire, |604 and they were feeling delight [<em>terpesthai</em>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<em>melpesthai</em>] a divine singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |605 playing on the special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>]; two special dancers [<em>kubistētēre</em>] among them |606 were swirling as he led [<em>ex-arkhein</em>] the singing-and-dancing [<em>molpē</em>] in their midst’ (|603 πολλὸς δ’ ἱμερόεντα χορὸν περιίσταθ’ ὅμιλος |604 τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς |606 μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντoς ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους). By contrast, the attested shorter version is as follows: ‘|603 A huge crowd stood around the place of the song-and-dance [<em>khoros</em>] that rouses desire, |604 and they were feeling delight [<em>terpesthai</em>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<em>melpesthai</em>] a divine singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |605 playing on the special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>]; two special dancers [<em>kubistētēre</em>] among them |606 were swirling as they led [<em>ex-arkhein</em>] the singing-and-dancing [<em>molpē</em>] in their midst’ (|603 πολλὸς δ’ ἱμερόεντα χορὸν περιίσταθ’ ὅμιλος |604 τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς |606 μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντες ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους). The deletions here are in line with the Greek text as I quote it, where we see an omission of the wording μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |605 φορμίζων. And my translation here follows the Greek text as I quote it, where we read ἐξάρχοντες and not ἐξάρχοντος. In the longer version, <em>melpesthai </em>‘sing-and-dance’ at I.18.604 and <em>molpē </em>‘song-and-dance’ at I.18.606 refer to the combined activities of singing and dancing by the <em>khoros</em>, and <em>ex-arkhein</em> ‘lead off [in performing]’ at I.18.606 signals an individuated act of performance that interacts with the collective performance of a <em>khoros</em>. In the shorter version, by contrast, the very presence of such an individuated act in a choral context is elided. In later comments, there will be further analysis of I.18.603–604–(605–)606 by way of comparing O.04.017–018, O.08.370–379, O.13.024–028. Already now, in any case, this much can be said: a formulaic analysis of both the longer and the shorter versions of I.18.603–604–(605–)606 indicates that both versions are compatible with Homeric diction, suiting different phases in the evolution of this diction as a formulaic system. In an earlier phase of such an evolution, Homer could be appreciated as a lead singer interacting with choral performance; in a later phase, by contrast, he would be recognized only as a soloist who recites epic verses.  </p>
