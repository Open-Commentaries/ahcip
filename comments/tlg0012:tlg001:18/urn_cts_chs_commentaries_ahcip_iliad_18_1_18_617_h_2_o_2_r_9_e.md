<p>The centerpiece of <em>Iliad</em> 18 is the shield of Achilles, envisioned as a work of art that defines the universe. The divine artisan Hephaistos makes this shield by way of metalwork, but Homeric poetry reconfigures the artistry of this metalwork by way of verbal art. And the artistry of Homeric poetry will now create or re-create a cosmos that is meant to contain the <em>Iliad</em> itself.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Shield_of_Achilles.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“The Shield of Achilles.” Illustration originally published in <em>The Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge</em>, September 22, 1832.</p>
