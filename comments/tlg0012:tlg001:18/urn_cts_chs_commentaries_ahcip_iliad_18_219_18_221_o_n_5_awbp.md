<p>The word ἀριζήλη (<em>arizēlē</em> 'perspicuous'), whose repetition bridges tenor and vehicle in this simile, is an intensive form of the adjective δῆλος (<em>dēlos</em>), a word that is usually translated 'clear'. As the standard dictionaries and the etymological dictionaries say (see LSJ9 and Chantraine <em>DEG</em> s.vv.  δῆλος and ἀρίζηλος), it means 'clear' in a visual sense or in a logical sense, and in that respect, it is unlike the English word 'clear', which is also and unexceptionally used of sounds. In this passage, where the word <em>arizēlē</em> applies to a sound, <em>phōnē</em>, that issues from the mouth of Achilles and is echoed by the goddess Athena, we have a rare example of synesthesia in epic diction, a metaphor of visibility applied to a sound that is elaborated by a compressed simile that then goes ahead and visualizes a trumpet sounding when a city is besieged by its enemies. </p>
