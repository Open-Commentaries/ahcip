<p>The <em>antux</em> ‘rim’ that is being made for the shield of Achilles, mentioned here at I.18.479 and again at I.18.608, is <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’, I.18.480, and the outermost fold or circle of this <em>antux</em> is the Ōkeanos, I.18.608. For Crates, as noted in the comment on I.18.478–609, this design representing the Ōkeanos is part of an overall cosmic allegory. In Eustathius <em>Commentary on the Iliad</em> vol. 4 p. 218 lines 14–17, the commentator draws attention to the morphological parallelism of <em>triplax</em> ‘threefold’ with <em>diplax</em> ‘twofold’, the second of which words refers at I.03.126 and at I.22.441 to a pattern-woven fabric. So, Eustathius recognizes here a crossover between the artistic worlds of metalwork and weaving. On the <em>diplax</em>, see already the comment on I.03.125–128. The epithet for <em>antux</em> ‘rim’ as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ at I.18.480 is relevant, since the same word is attested as an epithet for the woven fabric that is called a <em>diplax</em> at both I.03.126 and I.22.441 in the medieval manuscript tradition. As we see from the attested medieval texts, the epithet <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’ varies with <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ at both I.03.126 and I.22.441. For more on the interchangeable worlds of metalworking and weaving, see I.18.590 and the relevant comment on I.18.590–606.  </p>
