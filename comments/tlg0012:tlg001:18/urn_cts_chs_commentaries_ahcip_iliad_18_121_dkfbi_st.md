<p>Now that Patroklos has been killed, Achilles can finally recognize what he has to do. He has to kill Hector, thus ensuring his own death soon thereafter, and by doing so he will win for himself a <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that is <em>esthlon</em> ‘genuine, good’. The verb <em>arnusthai</em>, which takes <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ here as its direct object, means ‘struggle to win as a prize’. For more on this verb, see the comment on O.01.05.</p>
