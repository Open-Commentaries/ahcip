<p>At I.18.015–021, Achilles gets the grim news: that Patroklos has been killed by Hector, and that the fighting to recover his body, despoiled of the armor of Achilles, is still underway. Immediately, Achilles feels <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’, I.18.22. But the mourning and lamentation that is caused by this grief is aimed not only at Patroklos but also at Achilles in the narrative that follows, I.18.021–073. Within this narrative, Achilles gets to have his own wake, as it were. And the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that is now felt by Achilles will never leave him, even after he unsays his <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ later on in <em>Iliad</em> 22. Unlike the goddess Demeter in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Demeter</em>, for whom the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that she felt at verses 40 and 90 will go away at verse 436 as soon as she is reunited with Persephone, the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of Achilles will never go away. As Thetis the lamenting mother of Achilles declares at I.18.061–062, this hero will never again stop ‘grieving’, <em>akhnusthai</em>, I.18.062. From now on, Achilles will be <em>a man of constant sorrow</em> (on precedents for this expression, see <em>The Greek Hero in 24 Hours</em>, 1§54).
