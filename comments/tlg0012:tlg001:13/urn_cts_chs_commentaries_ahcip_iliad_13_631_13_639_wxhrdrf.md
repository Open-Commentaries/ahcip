<p>This insulting epithet <em>hubristai</em> ‘men of outrage’ at I.13.633 is applied here to the Trojans, whose <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ is said to be <em>atasthalon</em> ‘reckless’, I.13.634. There will be more to say about these words in a later comment. The connotations of these words are comparable to what is said in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 11.34 about the <em>habrótās</em> ‘luxuriance’ of the Trojans.  </p>
