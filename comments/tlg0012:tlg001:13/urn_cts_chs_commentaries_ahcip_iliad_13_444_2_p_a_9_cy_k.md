<p>At the very moment when the hero dies here, the war-god Ares literally takes away the hero’s life or <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’. To be compared is I.05.296, where the hero’s <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ is released from his body at the moment of death. But now we see that the agent for taking away the <em>menos</em> of the hero is Ares. Thus the ultimate killer of the generic hero as warrior is Ares himself, no matter who the immediate killer may be—as in this case, where the killing is performed by the hero Idomeneus with the direct help of the god Poseidon. The role of Ares in taking away the life of the generic hero at the moment of heroic death is relevant to the epithet of heroes as generic warriors: <em>therapontes</em> or ‘ritual substitutes’ of Ares. See the comment on I.02.110.  </p>
