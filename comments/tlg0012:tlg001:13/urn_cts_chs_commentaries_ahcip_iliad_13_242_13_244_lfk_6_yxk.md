<p>Zeus, in the act of launching his thunderbolt, can be visualized simultaneously in two ways, as here. First, he can be seen as casting his thunderbolt by throwing it with his own divine hand, I.13.243. But, second, he can be seen as casting his divine eye on his target, and his angry looks will thus launch his thunderbolt from within: that is the sense of the expression at I.13.244 here, ‘and his eyes [<em>augai</em>] are most visible [<em>arizēloi</em>]’ (ἀρίζηλοι δέ οἱ αὐγαί). The noun <em>augai</em>, which means literally ‘lights’, refers here to the eyes of Zeus, as also at I.13.837. On the expression <em>the look of Zeus</em>, see the comment on I.19.003–017.  </p>
