<p>Here is a working translation: ‘|825 If only I could be the child of aegis-bearing Zeus |826 for all days to come, and the Lady Hērā could be my mother, |827 and if only I could be honored [<em>tiesthai</em>] just as Athena and Apollo are honored, |828 —as surely as this day brings misfortune to the Argives, |829 all of them’ (|825 εἰ γὰρ ἐγὼν οὕτω γε Διὸς πάϊς αἰγιόχοιο |826 εἴην ἤματα πάντα, τέκοι δέ με πότνια Ἥρη, |827 τιοίμην δ’ ὡς τίετ’ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἀπόλλων, |828 ὡς νῦν ἡμέρη ἥδε κακὸν φέρει Ἀργείοισι |829 πᾶσι μάλ’). Hector expresses his aspiration to be immortal—not only to be the son of the divinities Zeus and Hērā but also to be divine just as Athena and Apollo are divine. On the syntax of the wording here, see the comment on I.18.464–466. Hector’s aspiration typifies a pattern of antagonism between immortal and mortal, divinity and hero: see the comments at I.08.538–541 and, further back, at I.06.286–311.  </p>
