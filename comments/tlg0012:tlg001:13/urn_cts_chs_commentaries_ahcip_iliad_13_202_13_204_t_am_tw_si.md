<p>Here the reference of <em>Aiante</em> shifts away from referring to the pair of Ajax the greater and Teukros. That is because the spotlight on the action shifts from Teukros to Ajax the lesser, so that the lesser Ajax can now become, retroactively, the implied second member of the dual <em>Aiante</em>.  </p>
