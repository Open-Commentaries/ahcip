<p class="chsnormal">While the hero Asios is fighting <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">pezos</span></em> ‘on foot’ against the Achaeans, I.13.385, the two horses that draw his chariot are right behind him, practically breathing down his neck—that is, down his shoulders. The driver of the horses is an unnamed <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">hēni-okhos</span></em> ‘chariot driver’, who is described as the <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">therapōn </span></em>‘attendant, ritual substitute’ of Asios, I.13.386. After Asios is killed, I.13.386–393, and his corpse is just lying there in front of the horses that once drew his chariot, I.13.392, the focus reverts to the <em><span class="chstranslitGreek">hēni-okhos</span></em> ‘chariot driver’, I.13.394. Still standing on the chariot platform, the chariot driver freezes, failing to turn the chariot around and drive the horse team back to safety, I.13.394–396. The Achaean hero Antilokhos takes this opportunity to spear the chariot driver, who then falls out of the chariot, and now Antilokhos can mount the empty chariot and drive it away himself, horses and all, I.13.396–401.</p>
