<p>Here we see that Odysseus is a paragon of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’ in his own right. He and only he has the strength to string his own bow, while all the suitors fail to show any matching strength. So, Odysseus here is a paragon not only of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ but also of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence, strength’.  </p>
