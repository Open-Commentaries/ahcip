<p>Compare <em>Od</em>. 19.576-581, where these same lines occur when Penelope proposes the contest of the bow. As noted there, Penelope’s memory and mindfulness of her marriage to Odysseus are exceptional in the <em>Odyssey</em>: other women, we are told (<em>Od</em>. 15.20-23), tend to forget their previous marriage and children when remarrying, but Penelope, as she issues the challenge of the bow to the suitors here, presents herself as doing the opposite (these lines are also found at <em>Od.</em> 19.576-581 where Penelope proposes the contest of the bow to determine the successful suitor). Compare<em> Od</em>. 24.194-198, where Agamemnon singles out Penelope’s memory of Odysseus as that which deserves commemorating as a <em>kleos</em>. Penelope stands out as an example of socially ethical behavior.</p>
