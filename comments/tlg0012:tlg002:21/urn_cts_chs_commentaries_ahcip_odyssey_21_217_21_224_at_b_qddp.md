<p>Odysseus at O.21.217–224 shows his scar to Philoitios the cowherd and Eumaios the swineherd: this way, he is finally recognized by them. In this context, the scar is explicitly called a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign’, O.21.217. As we saw at O.21.205., Odysseus already knows that both the cowherd and the swineherd have the right way of thinking, the right <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, and it is this mental that will enable them to recognize him. See the comment on that line.  </p>
