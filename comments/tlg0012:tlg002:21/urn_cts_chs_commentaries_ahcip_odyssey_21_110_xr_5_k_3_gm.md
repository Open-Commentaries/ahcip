<p>Telemachus recognizes here that the praise deserved by Penelope is self-evident, in the sense that the word <em>ainos</em> here can mean ‘praise’. What is less clear, however, is whether he fully recognizes—as of yet—the right words to use for encoding and decoding what should be said about his mother. The further meaning of <em>ainos</em> as ‘coded words’ leaves room for such lack of full clarity.  </p>
