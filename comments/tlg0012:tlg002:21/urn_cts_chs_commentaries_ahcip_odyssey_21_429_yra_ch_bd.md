<p>In the context of a future celebration, taking place in a post-heroic age at the festival of Apollo, the term <em>hepsiâsthai</em> ‘mock’ could refer to the ridiculing of the suitors by way of blame poetry. Odysseus as speaker here may be speaking beyond his own epic time, beyond the heroic age, by mocking his rivals for not yet knowing what he already knows full well will happen to them. On the perspectives of a post-heroic age with regard to the festival of Apollo, see the comment at O.22.437–479, where it is argued that the various grim dysfunctionalities that pollute the heroic world in <em>myth</em> are expurgated in the post-heroic world by way of <em>ritual</em>, as in the case of seasonally recurring festivals where primal ordeals are re-enacted in contexts of festive celebration, even merriment.  </p>
