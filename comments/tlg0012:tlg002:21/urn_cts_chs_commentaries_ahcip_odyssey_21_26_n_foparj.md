<p>Hēraklēs is involved here, however indirectly, in the story that tells how Odysseus once upon a time acquired his famous bow. The epithet <em>epi-histōr</em> describing Hēraklēs in this context, at O.21.026, can be interpreted as an agent noun: ‘one who has witnessed great events’ (Ἡρακλῆα μεγάλων ἐπιίστορα ἔργων). As an agent noun, <em>histōr</em> is derived not only from <em>eidénai</em> ‘know’ but also from <em>ideîn</em> ‘see’: a case in point is the meaning of <em>ep-ideîn</em> at I.22.061, ‘having witnessed many evil events’ (κακὰ πόλλ’ ἐπιδόντα).  </p>
