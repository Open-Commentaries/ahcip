<p>We see at work here the mythological convention of naming a son after a primary heroic trait of the father, as in the case of the son of Ajax, whose name <em>Eurusakēs</em> means ‘the one with the wide shield [<em>sakos</em>]’; this meaning is made explicit in the wording of Sophocles Ajax 574–578. See the comment on I.22.506–507 with reference to the the first of two names given to the son of Hector, Astyanax [<em>Astuanax</em>], I.06.403, which means ‘king [<em>anax</em>] of the city [<em>astu</em>]’. This meaning is relevant to the heroic role of the father as <em>protecting a citadel from sieges</em>. Such a role is expressed by the very name of Hector, <em>Héktōr</em>, which is an agent noun meaning ‘one who holds [<em>ekhein</em>]’ in the sense of ‘one who protects’. In the case of <em>Megapenthēs</em>, the meaning of his name as ‘the one with the great sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’ is made explicit by references to the great <em>penthos</em> ‘sorrow’ experienced by the Achaeans in reaction to a most painful wounding of Menelaos in the context of the Trojan War, I.04.197, I.04.207. Also viewed in general are the sorrows of the Trojan War itself, which Menelaos expresses in detail at O.04.093–112. See the comment on O.04.093–116. As we will see at O.04.220–226, Helen attempts to neutralize such sorrows by drugging the wine to be poured for the feast hosted by Menelaos in honor of Telemachus: the word for this drug is <em>nēpenthes</em>, Ο.04.221, which can be interpreted as ‘negating sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’. </p>
