<p>At O.04.113–116, we saw that Telemachus weeps in response to the laments of Menelaos over the sorrows of the Trojan War. And now we see at O.04.182–185 that Telemachus weeps again in response to further laments of Menelaos, whose sad words are at this point referring directly to the disappearance of Odysseus; also weeping are Helen and Menelaos himself, O.04.184–185, and Peisistratos too, O.04.186–189, who laments the death of his brother Antilokhos in the Trojan War. As we are about to see, the emotions conjured by such events as transmitted in genuine narratives about the Trojan War are to be contrasted with the absence of emotions in a false narrative induced by the drug <em>nēpenthes</em>, O.04.221, which prevents contact with the emotional world of lament. For the interpretation of <em>nēpenthes</em> as ‘negating sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’, I again refer ahead to the comment on O.04.220–226.  </p>
