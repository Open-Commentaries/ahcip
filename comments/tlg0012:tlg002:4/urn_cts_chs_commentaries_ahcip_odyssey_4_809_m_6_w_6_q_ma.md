<p>On <em>pulai</em> ‘gates’ as liminal points of entry and departure for consciousness and for the sun itself, see the comments at I.05.395–404, I.05.646. See also the anchor comment at I.08.367 on the Gates of Hādēs; also the anchor comment at I.23.071–076 on what the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Patroklos really wants for itself—and for Achilles (Points 5 and 6 and 9). </p>
