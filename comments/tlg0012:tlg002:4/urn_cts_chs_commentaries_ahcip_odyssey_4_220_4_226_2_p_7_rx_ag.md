<p>Before she narrates her own version of the Trojan War at O.04.235–264, Helen attempts to neutralize the sorrows experienced by those involved in the war. Most prominent among those present who had in fact been involved in the war is of course Helen’s consort Menelaos, who laments at O.04.093–112 the sorrows of the war. See the comment on O.04.093–116. Helen attempts to neutralize such sorrows by drugging the wine to be poured for the feast hosted by Menelaos in honor of Telemachus: the word for this drug is <em>nēpenthes</em>, Ο.04.221, which can be interpreted as ‘negating sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’. So, <em>nēpenthes</em> is an antidote to the pain of <em>penthos</em> ‘sorrow’. </p>
