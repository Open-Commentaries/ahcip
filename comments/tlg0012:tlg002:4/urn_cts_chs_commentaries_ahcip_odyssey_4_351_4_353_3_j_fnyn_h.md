<p>|351 Αἰγύπτῳ μ’ ἔτι δεῦρο θεοὶ μεμαῶτα νέεσθαι |352 ἔσχον, ἐπεὶ οὔ σφιν ἔρεξα τεληέσσας ἑκατόμβας· |353 οἱ δ’ αἰεὶ βούλοντο θεοὶ μεμνῆσθαι ἐφετμέων. </p><p>|351 In Egypt did they hold me up, the gods did, though I sorely wanted to make a homecoming [<em>neesthai</em>] back here [<em>deuro</em> = at home, where I am speaking now]. |352 Yes, they held me up, since [<em>epei</em>] I did not perform for them a perfect sacrifice of one hundred cattle [<em>hekatombai</em>]. |353 The gods always wanted their protocols to be kept in mind.</p><p>O.04.351–353</p><p>I interpret <em>hekatom-b-ē</em> ‘hecatomb’ as ‘sacrifice of one hundred [<em>hekaton</em>] cattle [<em>b-</em>]’ in Homeric contexts, as here. But I should note that there are some cases where the sacrifice is scaled down, referring not to cattle but to other sacrificial animals. In I.04.102, for example, the <em>hekatombē</em> involves sheep, not cattle. The passage here at O.04.351–353 is relevant to the narrative in Song 17 of Sappho, as quoted in the anchor comment at O.03.130–183 on two variant myths in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and <em>Odyssey</em> 4, part 1.  </p>
