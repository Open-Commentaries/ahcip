<p>This adjective <em>adeukḗs</em> is used in contexts referring to an interrupted sequence. In the present context, for example, <em>adeukḗs</em> describes the <em>ólethros</em> ‘doom’ that destroys a ship. See also O.06.273, O.10.245. The opposite of this adjective <em>adeukḗs</em> ‘discontinuous, interrupting’ can be seen in the adverb <em>endukéōs</em>, which can be interpreted as ‘continuously, uninterruptedly’. See the anchor comment at O.07.256. In terms of this interpretation, the root <em>deuk</em>-/<em>duk</em>- for this adjective/adverb conveys the sense of ‘continue’. </p>
