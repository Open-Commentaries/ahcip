<p>|15 ὣς οἱ μὲν δαίνυντο καθ’ ὑψερεφὲς μέγα δῶμα |16 γείτονες ἠδὲ ἔται Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο, |17 τερπόμενοι· μετὰ δέ σφιν ἐμέλπετο θεῖος ἀοιδὸς |18 φορμίζων· δοιὼ δὲ κυβιστητῆρε κατ’ αὐτοὺς |19 μολπῆς ἐξάρχοντος ἐδίνευον κατὰ μέσσους.</p><p>|15 So they feasted throughout the big palace with its high ceilings, |16 both the neighbors and the kinsmen of glorious Menelaos, |17 and they were feeling delight [<em>terpesthai</em>]; in their midst sang-and-danced [<em>melpesthai</em>] a divine singer [<em>aoidos</em>], |18 playing on the special lyre [<em>phorminx</em>]; two special dancers [<em>kubistētēre</em>] among them |19 were swirling as he led [<em>ex</em>-<em>arkhein</em>] the singing-and-dancing [<em>molpē</em>] in their midst. </p><p>This passage provides comparative evidence for interpreting both the shorter and the longer versions of the passage analyzed in the comment on I.18.603–604–(605–)606. As argued in that comment, a formulaic analysis of both the longer and the shorter versions of I.18.603–604–(605–)606 indicates that both versions are compatible with Homeric diction, suiting different phases in the evolution of this diction as a formulaic system. </p>
