<p>Menelaos laments here the sorrows of the Trojan War, O.04.093–112, and Telemachus responds by weeping, O.04.113–116. These sorrows are accentuated by the personal involvement of heroes like Menelaos and Odysseus as main participants in the war. The very idea of lament, as signaled elsewhere by words like <em>penthos</em> and <em>akhos</em>, is seen here as an aspect of genuine narrative about the heroic world. As we are about to see, such a genuine narrative is to be contrasted with the false narrative induced by the drug <em>nēpenthes</em>, O.04.221, which prevents contact with the emotional world of lament. For the interpretation of <em>nēpenthes</em> as ‘negating sorrow [<em>penthos</em>]’, I refer ahead to the comment on O.04.220–226.</p>
