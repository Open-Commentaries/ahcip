<p>Proteus makes a prophecy here, foretelling the immortalization of Menelaos in a <em>pedion</em> ‘field’ named <em>Ēlusion</em> ‘Elysium’, O.04.563. A comparable setting for immortalization is a place known as the <em>Makarōn nēsoi </em>‘Islands of the Blessed’ (as in Hesiod <em>Works and Days</em> 164–173). The name <em>Ēlusion</em> ‘Elysium’, as is evident from attestations outside of Homeric poetry, can refer to a mystical setting of immortalization as experienced by heroes worshipped in cult. From what evidence we have about hero cults, we can see that the rituals of worshipping heroes in cult places are ideologically synchronized with corresponding myths about the immortalization of these same heroes in paradise-like settings that are far removed from the everyday world. In fact, the forms <em>Ēlusion</em> &#x27;Elysium&#x27; and <em>Makarōn nēsoi</em> &#x27;Isles of the Blessed&#x27; are appropriate as names for actual cult sites. The proper noun <em>Ēlusion</em> coincides with the common noun <em>en-ēlúsion</em>, referring to a place made sacred by virtue of being struck by the thunderbolt (Pollux 9.41, etc.). The form <em>Ēlúsion</em> itself is glossed in the Alexandrian lexicographical tradition (Hesychius) as κεκεραυνωμένον χωρίον ἢ πεδίον ‘a place or field that has been struck by the thunderbolt&#x27;, with this added remark: καλεῖται δὲ καὶ ἐνηλύσια ‘and it is also called <em>enēlusia</em>’. As for <em>Makarōn nēsos</em> ‘Island of the Blessed’, there is a tradition that the name was actually applied to the old acropolis of Thebes, the Kadmeion; specifically, the name designated the sacred precinct where Semele, the mother of Dionysos, had been struck dead by the thunderbolt of Zeus (Parmenides via the Suda and via Photius, under <em>Makarōn nēsos</em>; Tzetzes on Lycophron 1194, 1204). We are immediately reminded of the poetic tradition that tells how Semele became immortalized as a direct result of dying from the thunderbolt of Zeus (see Pindar <em>Olympian</em> 2.25, in conjunction with Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 942). Inhabiting Elysium is the hero Rhadamanthys, O.04.564, who is described in this context as <em>xanthos</em> ‘with golden hair’. Similarly, Menelaos himself is conventionally described as <em>xanthos</em>: I.03.284, I.03.434, I.04.183, I.04.210, I.10.240, I.11.125, I.17.006, I.17.018, I.17.113, I.17.124, I.17.578, I.17.673, I.17.684, I.23.293, I.23.401, I.23.438, O.01.285, O.03.168, O.03.257, O.03.326, O.04.030, O.04.059, O.04.076, O.04.147, O.04.168, O.04.203, O.04.265, O.04.332, O.15.110, O.15.133, O.15.147. </p>
