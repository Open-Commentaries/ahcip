<p>At O.13.439–440 it was said that the goddess Athena, after parting with Odysseus on the island of Ithaca, ‘next’ went off to Sparta in order to connect with Telemachus there. The moment of that connection, which was going to happen ‘next’, was expressed by way of the adverb <em>epeita</em>, O.13.439. Now at O.15.001–003 this moment that had been destined to happen ‘next’ is finally at hand, and we see the goddess arriving at Sparta, where she will make it possible for Telemachus to connect mentally with his own <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ to Ithaca, O.15.003. Essential here at O.15.03 is the use of the verb <em>hupo-mnē-</em>, meaning ‘mentally connect’. The same verb is used in a comparable context at O.01.322. See the comment on O.01.320–322. Here at O.15.001–003, Telemachus will mentally connect not only with the idea of his own homecoming but also with the song of that homecoming, which will merge with the song of his father’s homecoming. Telemachus needs to be mentally connected to his own <em>nostos</em> not only in the sense of ‘homecoming’ and ‘song of homecoming’ but also, more mystically, ‘return to light and life’. On this mystical meaning, see the comment on O.01.005, where this noun <em>nostos</em> is explained as meaning etymologically a ‘return’ or a ‘coming-back’, derived from the verb-root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’, which has a deeper meaning as well: ‘come to’, in the sense of ‘come back to consciousness’. The noun <em>nostos</em> itself, meaning ‘homecoming’, likewise has a deeper meaning: ‘coming back to light and life’. Etymologically related to this noun <em>nostos</em> in the sense of ‘coming back to light and life’ is the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, which has the deeper meaning of ‘coming to’ in the sense of ‘coming back to consciousness’. As I argued in the comment on O.13.078–095, the idea of ‘coming to’ as embedded in the noun <em>nostos</em> is activated at the moment when Odysseus comes home to Ithaca: there he wakes up from a death-like sleep at the precise moment when the sun rises. To experience such a <em>nostos</em> as a ‘homecoming’, as I also argued in the same comment, is to experience a symbolic ‘return to light and life’, and the <em>Odyssey</em> as a ‘song of homecoming’ is such a <em>nostos</em>. Here at O.15.001–003, we see that the son of Odysseus must likewise experience a <em>nostos</em>, expressed here at O.15.003 not only by the noun <em>nostos</em> but also by the verb <em>néesthai</em>, derived from the root *<em>nes</em>-. This line, O.15.003, shows that the song of this <em>nostos</em>, of this homecoming, is meant to merge with the song of the father’s homecoming. See also the comment on O.01.088–089.  </p>
