<p>(What follows is epitomized from Nagy 2017.04.11 5§§29–31.) In the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>, the Minoan-Mycenaean world is linked more directly to Sparta than to Crete. To make this point, I start with the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 15, where the goddess Athena appears in an epiphany to Telemachus at Sparta. As Athena tells Telemachus at O.15.001–009, it is time for the young hero to conclude his visit at Sparta and to go back home to Ithaca. I highlight the fact that Sparta here is described here at O.15.001 as <em>eurukhoros</em> (εἰς εὐρύχορον Λακεδαίμονα), meaning ‘having a wide dancing-place’. I see here a Minoan-Mycenaean signature. Relevant is the word <em>Kallikhoron</em>, which is explained this way in the dictionary of Hesychius: Καλλίχορον· ἐν Κνωσσῷ ἐπὶ τῷ τῆς Ἀριάδνης τόπῳ ‘<em>Kallikhoron</em> was the name of the place of Ariadne in Knossos’. And the meaning of this ‘place of Ariadne’, <em>Kallikhoron</em>, is ‘the dancing-place that is beautiful’. It is most relevant to highlight here the fact that the word <em>khoros</em> can designate either the ‘place’ where singing and dancing takes place or the group of singers and dancers who perform at that place. Such a beautiful place, as we already saw in the comment on I.18.590–606, is made visible by the divine smith Hephaistos when he creates the ultimate masterpiece of visual art, the Shield of Achilles. At I.18.593–606, we see in action the singing and dancing that happens in the picturing of the divine place, the word for which is khoros, I.18.590. And the prima donna for such singing and dancing can be visualized as the girl Ariadne, for whom Daedalus had made the ultimate place for song and dance, I.18.592.  </p>
