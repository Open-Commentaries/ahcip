<p>The formulation of this wish shows that Odysseus is longing to be defined by an epic that is limited to the happenings in the Trojan War, excluding the happenings that he experiences in the <em>Odyssey</em>. But this is not to be. For Odysseus to be hero in his own epic, he must have a safe homecoming from Troy. </p>
