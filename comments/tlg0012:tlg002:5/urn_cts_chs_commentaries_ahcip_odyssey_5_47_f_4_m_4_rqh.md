<p>The accusative of <em>ommata</em> ‘eyes’ here, as the direct object of <em>thelgein</em>, indicates that the idea of <em>looking</em> is built into this verb. Accordingly, it can be argued that the Lithuanian verb <em>žvelgiù </em>‘look’ is a cognate of <em>thelgein</em>, which I translate as ‘put a trance on, enchant’. I interpret the enchantment here as an effect of visual attraction. </p>
