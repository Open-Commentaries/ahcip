<p>The comparison of Odysseus to an octopus here is a signature, as it were, of his reputation for being <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’. This epithet is analyzed in the comment on O.01.001–010. On the polytropic nature of the octopus, I cite two relevant passages: Theognis 215–218 and Pindar F 43 SM. </p>
