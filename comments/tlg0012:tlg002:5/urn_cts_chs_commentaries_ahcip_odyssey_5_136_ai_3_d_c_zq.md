<p>At O.05.136, Calypso says that she was intending to make Odysseus <em>athanatos</em> ‘immortal’ and <em>agērōs</em> ‘ageless’. Similarly at <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 214, Zeus when he abducts Ganymedes makes him <em>athanatos</em> ‘immortal’ and <em>agērōs</em> ‘ageless’. By contrast, at <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 221, Ēōs forgets to ask for agelessness after she abducts Tīthōnos and asks only that her mortal lover be <em>athanatos</em> ‘immortal’. So, she forgot to ask that he should have lasting <em>hēbē</em> ‘youth’, <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 224. </p>
