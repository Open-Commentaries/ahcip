<p>Only here in the <em>Odyssey</em> is the hero Tīthōnos ever mentioned, O.05.001. In the <em>Iliad</em>, there is a parallel mention of Tīthōnos at I.11.001. The wording of O.05.001–002 here matches the wording of I.11.001–002. The story of the abduction of Tīthōnos by Ēōs, goddess of dawn, is told at <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218–238. The liaison between the mortal man Tīthōnos and the immortal goddess Ēōs is parallel to the liaison between the mortal man Ankhises and the immortal goddess Aphrodite. And, as a result of both these affairs, the mortal man is permanently damaged: in the case of Tīthōnos, he loses his youth though he holds on to life. In the case of Ankhises, he is afflicted with some kind of paralysis. See the comment on <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218–238. The fact that Rhapsody 5 begins with a reference to an affair between a mortal man and an immortal goddess is relevant to the story of the affair between Odysseus and Calypso. </p>
