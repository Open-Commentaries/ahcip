<p>The verb <em>heleto</em> ‘took’ referring here at O.05.121 to the seduction of Orion by Ēōs the goddess of the dawn is neutral in comparison to other verbs indicating an abduction by force, as when Ēōs <em>hērpasen</em> ‘seized’ Tīthōnos in <em>Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite</em> 218. For more on the links of heroes like Orion and Tithōnos with Ēōs, see the comment on O.15.250–251.   </p>
