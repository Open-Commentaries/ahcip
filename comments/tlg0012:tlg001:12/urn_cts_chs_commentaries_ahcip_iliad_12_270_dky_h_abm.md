<p>The two warriors who are jointly named by way of the dual form <em>Aiante</em> here, about whom there will be more to say in a later comment, are urging the Achaeans to keep up the fight. To encourage the Achaeans, the dual <em>Aiante</em> say that it does not matter whether different warriors will make greater or smaller contributions to the effort: after all, warriors are not <em>homoioi</em> ‘the same as’ each other, since some are superior and some are middling and some are inferior in warfare, I.12.269–270. The word <em>homoio</em>- ‘similar to, same as’, used in comparisons, displays the semantics of relativism as well as absolutism in Homeric diction. For more on <em>homoio</em>- ‘similar to, same as’ see the anchor comment at I.05.441.  </p>
