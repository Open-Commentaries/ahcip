<p>Menestheus, the leader of the Athenians who came to fight at Troy, is stationed to guard a <em>purgos</em> ‘tower’ of the Achaean Wall, I.12.332/333/373. It is at this point in the Wall that the attacking forces on the Trojan side are making their breakthrough, and so the station of Menestheus is evidently located next to the political and sacral centerpoint of the Achaeans, where the stations of Agamemnon and Odysseus are also located. On this concept of a political and sacral centerpoint, see the comments on I.11.806–808. The proximity of the Athenian leader Menestheus to such a centerpoint can be seen as a subtle reference to the importance of Athens in the transmission of the <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>.  </p>
