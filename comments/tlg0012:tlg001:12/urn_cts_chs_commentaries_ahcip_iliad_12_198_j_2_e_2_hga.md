<p>In the Battle for the Ships, the objective of Hector is for the Trojans to set on fire the beached ships of the Achaeans, and, for this objective to be realized, the Trojans must break through the Wall of the Achaeans. There is a reference to such a breakthrough already at I.12.090. For further references, which occur mostly in <em>Iliad</em> 12, to the Trojan objective of breaking through the Wall, see I.12.090, I.12.223, Ι.12.257, I.12.261–262, I.12.308, I.12.418, Ι.12.440–441, I.13.679–680. Many of these references mention also the fire that threatens the beached ships of the Achaeans. From here on, further Iliadic mentions of (1) the Battle for the Ships, (2) the fire of Hector and his Trojans, and (3) the breakthrough of the Trojans in penetrating the Wall of the Achaeans will intensify. Accordingly, for practical reasons, comments on these mentions will from here on refer back only to the anchor comment as formulated here at I.12.198. </p>
