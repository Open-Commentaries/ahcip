<p>Zeus, sending a violent windstorm from the heights of Mount Ida at I.12.252–254, now signals at I.12.255 that this <em>kūdos</em> or ‘sign of glory’ goes to the Trojans, who are already starting to break through the Wall of the Achaeans, I.12.256–257. For more on the breakthrough of the Trojans, see the list of references in the comment for I.12.198.  </p>
