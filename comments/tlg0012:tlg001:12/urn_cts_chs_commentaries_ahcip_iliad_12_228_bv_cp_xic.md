<p>The meaning of the noun <em>theopropos</em> as ‘interpreter of signs’ is defined clearly in this verse: the role of such a person is ‘to interpret signs’, <em>hupo-krinesthai</em>, that is, ‘to respond to signs’ by distinguishing what is real from what is unreal. See the note on O.19.535. Relevant are the post-Homeric uses of the derivative agent noun <em>hupo-kritēs </em>in two senses, ‘dream-interpreter’ and ‘actor’ (HC 1§14). Also relevant is the implication here at I.12.228 of a coextensiveness between oracular poetry and epic.  </p>
