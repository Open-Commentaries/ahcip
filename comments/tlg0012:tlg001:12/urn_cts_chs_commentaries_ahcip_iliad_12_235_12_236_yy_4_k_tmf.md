<p>Hector here says that he understands the Will of Zeus, and that the god has already signaled his Will by nodding, I.12.236. We have seen such nodding before, at I.01.524–530 and at I.08.175–176. We have also seen, at I.08.175–176, that the Will of Zeus as signaled by his nodding will bring <em>nīkē</em> ‘victory’ to the Trojans and <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ to the Achaeans. So too the nodding of Zeus here at I.12.236 signals once again the Will of Zeus, expressed in this case by way of the plural of <em>boulē</em>, ‘will’, which is <em>boulai</em>. This noun <em>boulē</em>, as noted already at I.01.005, I.01.524–530, I.10.043–052, I.10.415, I.11.627, also conveys the idea of ‘planning’, not just ‘wishing’. We may compare the plural <em>boulai</em> ‘plans’ of Zeus at O.08.082, as noted in the comments on I.11.347.  </p>
