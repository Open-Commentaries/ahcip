<p>Heroes strive to avoid being seen in situations where they are bested: this way, they can also avoid the boasting of warriors who best them; at I.12.391, such a word for ‘boasting’ is <em>eukhetâsthai</em>, while the ‘words’ spoken in the act of boasting are <em>epea</em>—which are coextensive with the ‘words’ spoken in the act of performing epic poetry.  </p>
