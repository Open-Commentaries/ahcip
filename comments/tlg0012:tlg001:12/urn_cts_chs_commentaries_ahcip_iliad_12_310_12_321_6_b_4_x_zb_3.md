<p>The objective of the hero Sarpedon, as he declares here at I.12.318 to his fellow warrior Glaukos, is that the two of them must not be <em>akléees</em> ‘without epic glory [<em>kleos</em>]’. The people whom the two of us rule in Lycia, he continues, must recognize such an objective. This way, the <em>timē</em> ‘honor’ that the two of us receive in Lycia, I.12.310 (τετιμήμεσθα), which is a sign of our status there as cult heroes, will be matched by the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that the two of us will receive as epic heroes here in the <em>Iliad</em>.</p>
