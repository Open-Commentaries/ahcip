<p>This detail about a <em>skēptron</em> ‘scepter’ held by Teiresias is relevant not so much to him but to Odysseus, who is seeking to recover his kingship in Ithaca by way of a homecoming that only Teiresias can help him attain. On <em>skēptron</em> ‘scepter’ as a signal of kingship, see the comment on I.01.015.  </p>
