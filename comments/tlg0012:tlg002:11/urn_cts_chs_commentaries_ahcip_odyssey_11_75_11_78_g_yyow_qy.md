<p>|75 σῆμά τέ μοι χεῦαι πολιῆς ἐπὶ θινὶ θαλάσσης, |76 ἀνδρὸς δυστήνοιο, καὶ ἐσσομένοισι πυθέσθαι· |77 ταῦτά τέ μοι τελέσαι πῆξαί τ’ ἐπὶ τύμβῳ ἐρετμόν, |78 τῷ καὶ ζωὸς ἔρεσσον ἐὼν μετ’ ἐμοῖσ’ ἑτάροισιν.</p><p>|75 Heap up a tomb [<em>sēma</em>] for me [= Elpenor] at the shore of the gray sea, |76 wretched man that I am, so that even those who live in the future will learn about it. |77 Bring to fulfillment [<em>teleîn</em>] these things for me, and stick the oar on top of the tomb [<em>tumbos</em>] |78 —the oar that I used when I was rowing with my companions [<em>hetairoi</em>].</p><p>These instructions are given to Odysseus by Elpenor himself or, more accurately, by his <em>psūkhē</em>, O.11.051, and the wording makes it explicit that the tomb that is to be made for this dead sailor is a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal; tomb’. </p>
