<p>At O.11.602–604, it is said that Hēraklēs, described here as <em>autos</em> ‘himself’, O.11.602, is in Olympus, together with the immortal gods and married to Hēbē, so that the vision of Hēraklēs that is seen in Hādēs is just that, an <em>eidōlon</em> ‘vision’, at O.11.602. At I.01.004, we have seen that <em>autoi</em> ‘selves’ refers to dead bodies of heroes, to be contrasted with the word <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’, which refers to either (A) the <em>life-force </em>of heroes when they are alive or (B) the <em>disembodied conveyor of identity</em> when they are dead—as in the case of the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits at I.01.003. See the comment on I.01.003–005. At O.11.602–604, by contrast, the <em>autos</em> ‘self’ that is Hēraklēs is no longer dead but regenerated and thus immortalized. We may infer, then, that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Hēraklēs as his life-force has been reunited with his body, with his self, and that is why his <em>psūkhē </em>in Hādēs must be seen as a disembodied conveyor of his identity—as a mere <em>eidōlon</em> ‘vision’. </p>
