<p>This passage demonstrates the reciprocity, or complementarity, of memory and <em>mēnis</em> in the context of upholding proper social and cosmic order and the value system based on reciprocal exchange. Elpenor asks Odysseus to remember (<em>μνήσασθαι</em>, <em>Od</em>. 11.71) him and the funerary rites that are his due so as not to have Elpenor become a <em>mēnima</em>, ‘cause of <em>mēnis</em>’ (<em>Od</em>. 11.73), of the gods toward Odysseus. If Odysseus remembers and performs the rites, all is well, the cosmic order is maintained; if he forgets, he will incur <em>mēnis </em>as a punishment. Here, too, we can see that memory leads to proper conduct and helps avoid both the wrong courses of action and <em>mēnis</em>; <em>mēnis</em>, in turn, is the punishment when the rules are transgressed, and the fear of <em>mēnis</em> keeps one on the right path. This is central to the complementarity of memory and <em>mēnis </em>and neatly illustrated by the passage: when there is memory, there will be no <em>mēnis</em>, as memory keeps one mindful of the danger of incurring <em>mēnis</em>, and so helps avoid it in the first place. On the contrary, there will only be <em>mēnis</em> when this memory is absent. The relationship between memory and <em>mēnis </em>is thus not of perfectly symmetrical reciprocity, but the provision of one in the absence of the other.</p><p>See further:</p><p>Watkins, Calvert. 1977. “On Μῆνις.” <em>Indo-European Studies</em> 3:686-722.</p>
