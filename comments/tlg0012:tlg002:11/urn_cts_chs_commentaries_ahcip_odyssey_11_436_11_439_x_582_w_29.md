<p>Odysseus characterizes the suffering attendant on the Trojan expedition—including the many deaths depicted in the <em>Iliad</em>—as a consequence of Zeus’ displeasure and the “will (βουλαί) of women.” This description substantially modifies the causal framework put forward by the <em>Iliad</em>, which presents the events it describes as the result of “the will of Zeus” (Διὸς βουλή, as in <em>Iliad</em> 1.5) alone. Odysseus’ reconfiguration of Iliadic causality reflects the distinctive vision of the <em>Odyssey</em>, which portrays female figures as exercising considerable control over events: Athena, with the support of Zeus, is the divine sponsor of the plot (see Murnaghan 2005), and the success of Odysseus’ homecoming is repeatedly represented as depending on the goodwill of various women, above all Penelope. (See also<i> Odyssey </i>2.382, 11.226).
