<p>At O.10.516–520, Circe had instructed Odysseus to offer a <em>khoē</em> ‘libation’ to the dead after he enters Hādēs, O.10.518. This libation, to be poured into a shallow <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’ that he had to dig, O.10.517, would consist of three liquids, which would be poured in the following sequence, O.10.519–520: emulsified honey, water, wine. Following the instructions of Circe here at O.11.024–036, Odysseus does as he was told to do. But now we see a further detail: when he digs the shallow <em>bothros</em> ‘pit’, O.11.025, he uses his sword for the digging, O.11.024. Then he goes ahead and pours the <em>khoē</em> ‘libation’ to all the dead, O.11.026, and again the sequence of the three liquids he pours will be the same, O.11.027–028: emulsified honey, water, wine. </p>
