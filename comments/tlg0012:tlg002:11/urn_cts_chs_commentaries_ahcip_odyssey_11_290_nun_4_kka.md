<p>As we saw at I.02.658, the name of Hēraklēs is linked with the epic theme of <em>biē</em> in the sense of martial ‘force, violence’; even the name of Hēraklēs can be formulated periphrastically as ‘the force of Hēraklēs’. And now we see the same pattern of naming applied to a hero named Iphiklēs. The application is all the more apt here, since the element <em>īs</em> ‘force, violence’ in the name of Iphiklēs is a synonym of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence. </p>
