<p>Aside from beggars, there are of course many other kinds of <em>xenoi</em> ‘strangers’ to be hosted as potential guests. In the wording of Eumaios, such potential <em>xenoi</em> include various kinds of craftsmen or <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>), O.17.383. This word means literally ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’, where <em>dēmos</em> ‘community, district’ is to be understood as a legally-sanctioned zone of activity within which craftsmen are authorized to be practicing their crafts. Comparable is the concept of <em>áes cerd</em> ‘people of the crafts’ in medieval Irish legal traditions: these craftsmen are entitled to juridical immunity as they travel from one petty kingdom or túath to another in the course of practicing their crafts, <em>and the practitioners of such crafts include various social grades of poets</em>. (Details in Nagy 2011a §149.) Similarly in the case of the <em>dēmiourgoi</em> (<em>dēmioergoi</em>) ‘craftsmen of the <em>dēmos</em>’ at O.17.383: these craftsmen too must have been juridically immune as they traveled from one <em>dēmos</em> to another in the course of practicing their crafts. The practictioners of such crafts included the categories of <em>mantis</em> ‘seer’, <em>iētēr</em> ‘physician’, and <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’, as we see at O.17.384. And, as in the case of the medieval Irish craftsmen, these crafts also included the category of the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ or poet, as we see at O.17.385.  </p>
