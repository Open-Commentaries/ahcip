<p>The parallelism of the <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter’ with the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ is particularly noteworthy, since the craft of the singer is conventionally compared to the craft of the carpenter. Especially relevant here is the wording in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 3.113–114: here the poets of epic are compared metaphorically to <em>tektones</em> ‘carpenters, joiners’ who ‘join together’ the <em>epea</em> ‘words’ of poetry (ἐπέων ... τέκτονες οἷα ... | ἅρμοσαν). The verb-stem <em>harmot</em>-/<em>harmod</em>- that I translate as ‘join together’ here (ἅρμοσαν) derives from the root *<em>ar</em>-, meaning ‘join’. Relevant is the &quot;speaking name&quot; (<em>nomen loquens</em>) name of Homer, <em>Hóm-ēros</em>, which can be analyzed morphologically as a compounding of <em>homo</em>- ‘together’ with the root <em>ar</em>- ‘join’, meaning ‘he who joins together’ in the metaphorical sense of a ‘joiner, carpenter’. See also the note at I.05.722.  </p>
