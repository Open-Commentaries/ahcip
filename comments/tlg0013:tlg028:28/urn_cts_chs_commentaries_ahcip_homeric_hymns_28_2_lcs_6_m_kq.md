<p>Athena is in fact the goddess of intelligence, daughter of the god Zeus and of a goddess named Mētis (Hesiod <em>Theogony</em> 886-900); this name Mētis comes from the noun <em>mētis</em>, which means ‘intelligence’, and Athena herself declares that her <em>kleos</em>, ‘glory’, is due to her own <em>mētis</em>, ‘intelligence’ (<em>Odyssey</em> 13.299). As we can see from a primary epithet of Odysseus, <em>polumētis</em>, ‘intelligent in many ways’ (<em>Iliad</em> 1.311, etc.; <em>Odyssey</em> 2.173, etc.), the goddess Athena must have a special relationship with this hero; in fact, this same epithet applies to Athena herself (<em>Homeric Hymn to Athena</em> 2).</p>
