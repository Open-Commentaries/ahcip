<p>Odysseus and his companions have escaped from the cave of the Cyclops, where some of them died, and now the survivors are sailing on, described as <em>ásmenoi</em>, which I translate as ‘returning to light and life’. As argued by Frame 1978:6–33 (also 2009:39–41), the etymology of this participle <em>ásmenos</em> can be explained by deriving it from *<em>n̥s-menos</em>, where the element *<em>n̥s-</em> is the zero grade of the Indo-European root <em>*nes-</em>, meaning ‘return to light and life’. This etymology has been confirmed by de Lamberterie 2014. Here at O.09.566, the etymological explanation ‘returning to light and life’ corresponds to what has just happened to Odysseus and his companions: they have escaped from the darkness of the cave and from the threat of death there, emerging into the light and thus winning back their lives. So, they have literally returnd to light and life. For more on the semantics of ‘return to light and life’ as conveyed by the words <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ and <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.003. </p>
