<p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 10§§8–9.) As we saw already at the very beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the hero’s <em>nostos</em>, ‘return’ at O.01.005 connects with his <em>nóos</em> ‘mind, thinking’ at O.01.003 not only in the explicit sense of <em>thinking about saving his own life</em> but also in the implicit sense of <em>being conscious of returning home</em>. This implicit sense is encoded in the telling of the myth about the land of the Lotus-Eaters here at O.09.082–104. When Odysseus visits this land, those of his comrades who eat the lotus lose their consciousness of home and therefore lose their power to return home. The verb <em>lēth-</em>, ‘forget’, combined with <em>nostos</em>, ‘return’, as its object, conveys the idea of such unconsciousness, O.09.097/102. By contrast, the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind, thinking’ conveys the idea of being conscious of <em>nostos</em>. So, here is the basic teaching to be learned from the myth about the land of the Lotus-Eaters: if you lose the “implant” of homecoming in your mind, you cannot go home because you no longer know what home is. </p>
