<p>|3 ἦ τοι μὲν τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ |4 τοιοῦδ’, οἷος ὅδ’ ἐστί, θεοῖσ’ ἐναλίγκιος αὐδήν. |5 οὐ γὰρ ἐγώ γέ τί φημι τέλος χαριέστερον εἶναι |6 ἢ ὅτ’ ἐϋφροσύνη μὲν ἔχῃ κάτα δῆμον ἅπαντα, |7 δαιτυμόνες δ’ ἀνὰ δώματ’ ἀκουάζωνται ἀοιδοῦ |8 ἥμενοι ἑξείης, παρὰ δὲ πλήθωσι τράπεζαι |9 σίτου καὶ κρειῶν, μέθυ δ’ ἐκ κρητῆρος ἀφύσσων |10 οἰνοχόος φορέῃσι καὶ ἐγχείῃ δεπάεσσι· |11 τοῦτό τί μοι κάλλιστον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν εἴδεται εἶναι.</p><p>|3 This is indeed a beautiful thing, to listen to a singer [<em>aoidos</em>] |4 such as this one [= Demodokos], the kind of singer that he is, comparable to the gods with the sound of his voice [<em>audē</em>], |5 for I declare, there is no outcome [<em>telos</em>] that is more gratifying [<em>khariestero</em>-]|6 than the moment when the spirit of festivity [<em>euphrosunē</em>] prevails throughout the whole community [<em>dēmos</em>] |7 and the people at the feast [<em>daitumones</em>], throughout the halls, are listening to the singer [<em>aoidos</em>] |8 as they sit there—you can see one after the other—and they are seated at tables that are filled |9 with grain and meat, while wine from the mixing bowl is drawn |10 by the one who pours the wine and takes it around, pouring it into their cups. |11 This kind of thing, as I see it in my way of thinking, is the most beautiful thing in the whole world. </p><p>O.09.003–012</p><p>(Epitomized from MoM 4§§71–73.) As Odysseus himself says here, as he finally proceeds to identify himself, there no greater <em>kharis</em> or ‘gratification’ in the whole world than the combination of good feasting and good singing, and the model for the general reference to singing here is the singer Demodokos. The <em>kharis</em> ‘gratification’ is signaled by the adjective <em>khariestero</em>- ‘more gratifying’ at O.09.005, referring to a <em>telos</em> ‘outcome’: <em>there is no outcome that is more gratifying than what happens at a feast</em>. The word <em>euphrosunē</em> ‘festivity, merriment’, O.09.006, signals the poetic occasion. On the programmatic implications of this word as an indicator of the festive atmosphere, as it were, of the poetic occasion, I refer to a definitive formulation by Bundy 1986:2 with reference to the poetics of Pindar (see BA 91, 235; also PH 198). The feast that is going on here at the beginning of Rhapsody 9 is a continuation of the feast that is already signaled by the word <em>dais </em>at O.08.429, which basically means ‘feast’. In that context, <em>dais</em> refers short-range to an occasion of communal dining as indicated by the word <em>dorpon </em>‘dinner’, O.08.395, which will take place after sunset, O.08.417. The intended guest of honor at this feast will be Odysseus. This occasion of communal dining leads into the third song of Demodokos, O.08.484–485. But this same word <em>dais</em> at O.08.429 is also making a long-range reference: it refers metonymically to a stylized festival that has been ongoing ever since an earlier occasion of communal dining, O.08.071–072, which actually led into the first song of Demodokos. O.08.073–083. And the connectivity goes even further back in time. Leading up to the communal dining, there had been an animal sacrifice as expressed by the word <em>hiereuein</em> ‘sacrificially slaughter’ at O.08.059. Then, the meat of the sacrificed animals had been prepared to be cooked at the feast, O.08.061. And I stress that the word at O.08.061 for ‘feast’ is once again <em>dais</em>. In terms of this sequence, the metonymic use of the word <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ marks a whole complex of events that are typical of festivals. </p>
