<p>  </p><p>Odysseus’ contemplation of the ideal feast while visiting the Phaeacians presents us with a picture of the sort of situation where <em>kharis</em> (reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of <em>kharis</em>) points to the upholding of good social order, and the meal can be seen as a manifestation of the good social bond in the community. Here, not only is the ideal meal pleasant, endowed with <em>kharis</em> and <em>euphrosune</em>, ‘good cheer’ – Euphrosyne even being the name of one of the Kharites – but it is orderly (<em>ἑξείης</em>, “in order,” O.9.8) and upheld as the best state of affairs (<em>κάλλιστον</em>, “finest,” “most beautiful,” “best,” O.9.11). The participants in such a meal, then, are morally good, following the principles for good conduct. This ideal meal, endowed with <em>kharis</em>, is in stark contrast with the one foreshadowing the doom of the suitors at O.20.392-394 (where see my comment), described as <em>akharistos</em>, ‘lacking <em>kharis</em>,’ and payback for their evil deeds. </p><span>See further:</span><p>MacLachlan, Bonnie. 1993. <em>The Age of Grace: Charis in Early Greek Poetry</em>.
