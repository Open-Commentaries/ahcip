<p>(Epitomized from Nagy 2007b:61.) The power of the Homeric simile in advancing the plot of epic is evident in the simile here at O.09.390–394, referring to the blinding of the Cyclops: when Odysseus and his men thrust into the single eye of the monster the fire-hardened tip of a wooden stake they had just crafted, the sound produced by this horrific act is compared to the sound produced when a blacksmith is tempering steel as he thrusts into cold water the red-hot edge of the axe or adze he is crafting. From a cross-cultural survey of myths that tell how a hero who stands for the civilizing forces of <em>culture</em> blinds a monster who stands for the brutalizing forces of <em>nature</em>, it becomes clear that such myths serve the purpose of providing an aetiology for <em>the invention of technology</em> (Burkert 1979:33–34). It is no coincidence that the <em>three Cyclopes</em> in the Hesiodic <em>Theogony</em> (139–146) are imagined as exponents of technology: they are identified as the <em>three blacksmiths</em> who crafted the thunderbolt of Zeus (Burkert 1979:156n23). Thus the simile about the tempering of steel in the Homeric narration of the blinding of the Cyclops serves the purpose of contextualizing and even advancing that narration by way of highlighting aspects of an underlying myth that is otherwise being shaded over. </p>
