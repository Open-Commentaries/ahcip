<p>This land, as described here with reference to a mainland correlated with an offshore island, is a poeticized version of a colony in the making—before colonization actually happens. The Greek word for such colonization is <em>ktisis</em>, which literally means ‘foundation’. On <em>ktisis</em> poetry, see BA 180–181 and GMP 74. </p>
