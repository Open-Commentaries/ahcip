<p>Just as memory is the principle that maintains good behavior and keeps one on the right track (cp. <em>Od</em>. 2.229-41 and see note there), this passage illustrates the power of forgetting in leading people astray from their proper path and failing to do the right thing. Eating lotus makes Odysseus’ men want νόστου τε λαθέσθαι ‘forget return home’ (the same effect of forgetting caused by lotus at <em>Od</em>. 9.102). Not only do they no longer think about it, but they are unable to act on it either: it takes Odysseus’ using force to bring them back to their ship and carry on. Indeed, forgetting appears to be one of the main obstacles for Odysseus’ reaching home (cp. <em>Od</em>. 1.57, 10.236), and Ithaca, or <em>nostos</em>, is one of the two recurring objects of forgetting in the <em>Odyssey </em>(the other object being grief, regularly <em>un</em>forgettable, e.g. Penelope’s unforgettable grief at the loss of Odysseus, <em>Od</em>. 1.342). In contrast, it is with a call to <em>remember</em> his fatherland that Odysseus’ companions get him to act and make him continue on his way home from Kirke’s island (<em>Od.</em> 10.472).</p>
