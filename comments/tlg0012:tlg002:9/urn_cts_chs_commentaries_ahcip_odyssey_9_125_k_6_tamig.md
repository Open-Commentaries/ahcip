<p>(Epitomized from PP 172.) Eustathius (1.9), in the Prolegomena to his commentary on the <em>Iliad</em>, says that performers of the <em>Iliad</em> wore red while performers of the <em>Odyssey</em> wore purple. He may perhaps be guessing when he attributes to ‘the ancients’ the idea that red stands for the blood shed in war, and purple, for the sea, as the setting for the wanderings of Odysseus. Still, his report about the actual dichotomy in color seems to be grounded in tradition. In Homeric diction, we find a parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on ships: we already saw <em>nēes miltoparēioi</em> ‘ships having cheeks of red’ at I.02.637, with reference to the ships of Odysseus, and now we see it again here at O.09.125, with reference to generic ships. To be contrasted is the expression <em>neas</em> <em>phoinīkoparēious</em> ‘ships with cheeks of purple’ at O.11.124 and O.23.271. Moreover, the inventories of chariots in the Linear B tablets show yet another parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on chariots: the noun i-qi-ja ‘chariot’ is described as either mi-to-we-sa = <em>miltówessa</em> ‘red’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4407 or po-ni-ki-ja = <em>phoinikiā</em> ‘purple’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4402. For the translation ‘purple’ in the latter case, I note φοινικόβαπτα ἐσθήματα ‘clothing dyed in purple’ in Aeschylus <em>Eumenides</em> 1028. </p>
