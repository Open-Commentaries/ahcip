<p>After having just killed Patroklos, Hector goes after Automedon, who is evidently still standing on the platform of the chariot and who is marked here as the <em>therapōn</em> of Achilles. Hector takes aim with his spear, but he misses hitting Automedon, who drives off with the chariot, I.16.864–867. Automedon here is no ritual substitute for Patroklos, nor is he now a ritual substitute for Achilles, since Patroklos has just now fulfilled that role by getting killed instead of Achilles.  </p>
