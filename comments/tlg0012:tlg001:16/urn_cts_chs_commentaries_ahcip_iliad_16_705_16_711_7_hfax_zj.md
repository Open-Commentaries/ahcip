<p>Patroklos confronts Apollo four times and then backs off, thus avoiding the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of the god, I.16.711. At the moment of his climactic fourth confrontation with Apollo, Patroklos is described as <em>daimoni isos</em> ‘equal to a <em>daimōn</em>’, I.16.705. The ‘superhuman force’ to which this word <em>daimōn</em> refers here can be understood to be Apollo himself. We see here a climactic moment in a pattern of divine-human antagonism that links the god Apollo with the hero Achilles, but Patroklos can now take upon himself the role of a ritual substitute for Achilles.  </p>
