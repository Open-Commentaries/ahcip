<p>In this verse, Achilles is speaking about Briseis. In the Scholia T for this same verse, I.16.057, a variant tradition is reported about this captive woman: it comes from the epic known as the <em>Cypria,</em> which was part of the <em>epic Cycle</em>. In the <em>Cypria</em>, as we are told by the Scholia T here at I.16.057, Achilles captured Briseis when he conquered the city of Pedasos. In the <em>Iliad,</em> by contrast, the city that Achilles conquered when he captured Briseis was Lyrnessos, I.02.689–694. For more about such variation between Pedasos and Lyrnessos, see the comments on I.20.089–102 and I.20.187–194. See also the anchor comments at I.02.689–694 and I.09.128–131 / 270–272 on Aeolian women in the <em>Iliad.</em></p>
