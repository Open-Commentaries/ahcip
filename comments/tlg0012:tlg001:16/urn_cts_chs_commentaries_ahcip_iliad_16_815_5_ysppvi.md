<p>Patroklos is now <em>gumnos</em> ‘stripped’ of all his armor, ready to be killed. While he was still wearing the armor, he would have been been invulnerable. At a later point, after Hector has already taken possession of this armor and is now seen wearing it, I.17.194, the adjective <em>ambrota</em> ‘immortalizing’ is applied to these <em>teukhea</em> ‘arms’. This adjective <em>ambroto</em>- ‘immortalizing’ is applied to words that make the hero immune to death.  </p>
