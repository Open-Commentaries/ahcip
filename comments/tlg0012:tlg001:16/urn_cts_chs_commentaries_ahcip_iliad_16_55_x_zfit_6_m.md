<p>equation of akhos with pathon algea (and akhos’ signaling le transfer du mal)</p><p>See the comments on I.01.188, I.01.407–412, I.01.503–510, I.01.509, I.01.558–559, I.09.003, I.09.008–009, I.11.317–319, and I.16.022. Here at I.16.055, the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ that Achilles feels because he was dishonored by Agamemnon and by the Achaeans in general is equated, in his own words, with <em>algea</em> ‘pains’, object of the verb <em>paskhein</em> ‘suffering’. The idea of personal heroic suffering as expressed by way of the combination <em>paskhein</em> and <em>algea</em> here in the case of Achilles is parallel to what we see in the case of Odysseus at O.01.004.</p><p>Additionally, the word <em>ákhos</em> signals <em>le transfer du mal</em>, or 'a transfer of evil':</p><p>the <em>ákhos</em> of Achilles leads to<br />the <em>ménis</em> of Achilles leads to<br />the <em>ákhos</em> of the Achaeans.</p>
