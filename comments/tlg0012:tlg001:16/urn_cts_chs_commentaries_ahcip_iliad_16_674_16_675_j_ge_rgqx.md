<p>These two verses, repeated at I.16.456–457 and foreshadowed by three verses at I.07.084–086 containing an indirect reference to the funeral and entombment of Achilles, refer to the funeral and entombment of Sarpedon in his role as a cult hero. Here I give an epitome of a far more detailed argumentation in Nagy 2012:60–69. In terms of hero cult, the wording that refers here at I.16.456–457 to a funeral and an entombment implies a ritual preparing of the dead body for a mystical revival after death. The word that refers to such immortalization in these Homeric passages is <em>tarkhuein</em> (ταρχύσουσι), at I.07.085, I.16.456, I.16.674. It can be argued that this Greek word <em>tarkhuein</em>, which I translate here neutrally as ‘ritually prepare’, is a borrowing from the Anatolian language that we know as Lycian, and that the corresponding Lycian word conveys the idea of ‘immortalize’. The most relevant forms in the surviving corpus of Anatolian linguistic evidence are (1) Lycian <em>Trqqñt</em>-, name of a Lycian thunder god; (2) the cognate Luvian form <em>Tarḫunt</em>-, name of the thunder god who is head of the Luvian pantheon; (3) the cognate Hittite form <em>tarḫu</em>-/<em>tar(r)uḫ</em>- (/<em>tarx<sup>w</sup></em>-/), a verb meaning ‘be victorious, overcome’. Cognates of this Hittite verb <em>tarḫu</em>- in other Indo-European languages convey the idea of ‘overcome’ or ‘transcend’ in contexts where the object of transcendence is death itself (<em>Greek Mythology and Poetics</em>, 139). An example is the Greek compound noun <em>nek-tar</em> (νέκταρ), consisting of roots meaning ‘death’ (<em>nek</em>- as in <em>nekros</em> ‘corpse’) and ‘conquer’ (-<em>tar</em>, cognate with Hittite <em>tarḫu</em>-). I argue that the Lycian and the Luvian names of the thunder god convey the idea of revivifying as well as overcoming, since thunder gods as described in Indo-European languages have the power to use their thunder weapons not only to overcome violently their enemies but also to preserve and thus make sacred their own devotees—and even to revivify them</p>
