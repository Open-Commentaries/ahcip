<p>At I.16.287–292, Patroklos successfully defends the beached ships of the Achaeans: he kills Puraikhmēs, the foremost attacker, and he puts the other attackers to flight, thus saving the Achaeans by ‘quenching’, as expressed by way of <em>sbennunai</em>, I.16.293, the fire that had threatened their ships.  </p>
