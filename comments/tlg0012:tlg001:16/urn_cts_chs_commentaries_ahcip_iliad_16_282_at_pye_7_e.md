<p>For Achilles to renounce his <em>mēnithmos</em> ‘anger’ is equated, already here, to his restoring the relationship that should exist among companions who are <em>philoi</em> ‘near and dear’ to each other: such a relationship, as we see here, is <em>philotēs</em> ‘being near and dear to one’s near and dear ones’. In the <em>Iliad</em>, Patroklos takes on the role of restoring, by way of his own death, such <em>philotēs</em> between Achilles and the Achaeans.  </p>
