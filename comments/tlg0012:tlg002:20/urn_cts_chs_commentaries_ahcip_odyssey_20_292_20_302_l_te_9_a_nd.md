<p>The suitor Ktesippos goes even beyond the base behavior of the other suitors by throwing the <em>pous</em> &#x27;foot&#x27; of a cow at Odysseus, O.20.299, though he misses. Presumably, this part of the sacrificial animal was the least prestigious portion of all the beef to be consumed on the occasion of the feasting that followed the hecatomb marking the feast of Apollo. For more on this hecatomb, which involved the sacrifice of notionally one hundred cattle to celebrate the feast of Apollo, see the anchor comment at O.20.276–280. The insulting of the disguised Odysseus by the provocative Ktesippos is bipartite here: (1) Ktesippos mocks Odysseus <em>in words</em> by sarcastically offering him a portion of the feast that would suit the most lowly of participants, and (2) he mocks him <em>in action</em> by throwing that portion at him instead of handing it over to him.
