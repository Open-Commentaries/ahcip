<p>Because the goddess Athena has destabilized for the suitors their <em>noēma</em> ‘thinking [by way of <em>nóos</em>]’, they will be incapable of ever recognizing the disguised Odysseus—until it is too late for them. The noun <em>noēma</em> is derived from the verb <em>noeîn</em> ‘take note of, notice’, which signals the kind of thinking that leads to recognition. See especially the comment at O.19.215–248.  </p>
