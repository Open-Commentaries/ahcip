<p>  </p><span>In this passage we see that the suitors’ lack of #<em>kharis </em>in their dealings with Odysseus’ household is repaid by an <em>akharistos</em> meal, one that has no #<em>kharis</em> (as the term applies to the reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of #kharis). Although the end of the passge, “for they were the first to contrive unseemly things” (O.20.394), appears to explain the meal’s lack of <em>kharis </em>as a result of Athena’s and Odysseus’ initiative in unjust machinations, according to Penelope, the suitors have done <em>ἀεικέα ἔργα</em>, “unseemly deeds,” before this. Furthermore, she connects the suitors’ unseemly deeds directly with a lack of #<em>kharis</em> in return for good deeds (O.4.694-695, where see my comment). The lack of #<em>kharis</em> in this meal as the reciprocation of the lack of #<em>kharis</em> in the suitors’ feasting in Odysseus’ house, therefore, is another manifestation of the interconnections of #<em>kharis</em>, reciprocity and social order, and the concerns regarding them that run through the fabric of the <em>Odyssey</em>. </span><span>See further:</span><p>Seaford, Richard. 1994. <em>Reciprocity and Ritual: Homer and Tragedy in the Developing City-State</em>.
