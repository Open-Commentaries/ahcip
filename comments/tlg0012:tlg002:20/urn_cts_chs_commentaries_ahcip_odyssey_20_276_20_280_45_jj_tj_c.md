<p>The feasting that we see being described here at O.20.276–280 involves the whole <em>astu</em> ‘city’ of Ithaca, O.20.276, and, as we see in the wording of O.20.276–277, all this feasting climaxes in a <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, as proclaimed throughout the city by <em>kērūkes</em> ‘heralds’. On the word <em>hekatombē</em> ‘hecatomb’, a priestly word referring to the sacrifice of one hundred cattle, see the comment on O.04.351–353. The occasion for this hecatomb is evidently a <em>festival of Apollo</em>, signaled by the vivid description at O.20.277–278: the Achaeans are now seen assembling inside the sacred <em>alsos</em> ‘grove’ of the god Apollo, O.20.278. What follows after the sacrifice of a hundred cattle is then described at O.20.279–280: the meat is cooked and divided among the participants. And the whole occasion of this feasting is indicated at O.20.280 by way of two all-important words here: (1) <em>dais</em> ‘feast, division of portions (of meat); sacrifice’, and (2) <em>daiesthai</em> ‘feast; divide (meat), apportion, distribute’. On <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ as a stylized way of referring to an overall <em>festival</em>, see the introductory comments at O.08.038 and at O.08.061; also the follow-up comments at O.08.429, O.09.003–111, O.13.023. For another reference to the festival of Apollo, see the comment at O.21.267.  </p>
