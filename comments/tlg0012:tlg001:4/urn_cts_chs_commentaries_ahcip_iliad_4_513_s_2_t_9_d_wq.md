<p>The idea of mulling one’s <em>kholos</em> ‘anger’, where a more literal translation of <em>pessein</em> would be ‘cooking’ or ‘digesting’ the anger, is a theme that marks the epic traditions about not only Achilles but also Meleagros, who is presented as a model for Achilles at I.09.550–605. The same expression about mulling one’s <em>kholos</em> ‘anger’ appears in the story about Meleagros, I.09.565.  </p>
