<p>The plural <em>toxa</em> here and at I.04.206 is elliptic: whereas singular <em>toxon</em> as at I.04.124 means ‘bow’, plural <em>toxa</em> as at I.04.196 and I.04.206 means not ‘bow+bow+bow+bow…’ but rather, elliptically, ‘bow+arrow+arrow+arrow…’. In other words, <em>toxa</em> means ‘bow and arrows’.  </p>
