<p>A deeper meaning of the noun <em>dais</em> is revealed here in the wording of Zeus, who says that his <em>bōmos</em> ‘altar’—which is ‘mine’, he adds—has never lacked an equitable <em>dais</em> or ‘portion’ of sacrificial meat whenever Priam and the people of Troy sacrificed to him. This wording reveals that a <em>dais</em> is not only a ‘feast’ but also a sacrifice to the gods. See the comment on I.01.423–425. The division of meat on the occasion of a <em>dais</em> necessarily concerns immortals as well as mortals, and the epithet <em>isē</em> ‘equitable’ referring to the <em>dais</em> or ‘division of portions’ here concerns primarily the god Zeus himself. It looks as if the word <em>dais</em> can evoke a primordial time when immortals and mortals once actually feasted together at one table, as it were. </p>
