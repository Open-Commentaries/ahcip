<p>What is <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ for the Achaeans becomes a <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ for the Trojans. We see here a clear example of <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ as a synonym of <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ in Homeric diction. In the present context, the underlying sense of pain conveyed by <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is not only individual, made real by the wounding of the hero Menelaos: it is also collective, since the pain of Menelaos becomes a pain felt by all the Achaeans, who now find themselves on the losing side of the battle because they have lost Menelaos as leader—at least, they have lost him for the moment. The healing of the pain will be up to the warrior-physician Makhaon, son of the ultimate physician Asklepios.  </p>
