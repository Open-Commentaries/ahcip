<p>Epitome from <a href="https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5983">Nagy 2015</a>§85. When the hero Pandaros makes his announcement-in-prayer, as expressed by the verb <em>eukhesthai</em>, I.04.119, he says that <em>he will perform an animal sacrifice</em>, I.04.120, in hopes that Apollo, the god to whom he is praying, will grant him <em>what he is wishing for</em>, which is <em>a safe homecoming</em>, I.04.121. But the wish—and therefore the prayer—is a failure, since Pandaros will soon be killed on the battlefield, I.05.290-296. To paraphrase in cognate Latin terms: the <em>vōtum</em> as an ‘announcement-in-prayer’ is a failure here because the same <em>vōtum</em> as a ‘wish-in-prayer’ is not fulfilled: the hero Pandaros will never return home safe and sound.  </p>
