<p>The collocation <em>ērare tektōn</em> (ἤραρε τέκτων) ‘the joiner joined together’ is relevant to the etymologies of both the verb and the noun here, which are respectively <em>ar-ar-iskein</em> ‘fit together, join together’ and <em>tektōn</em> ‘carpenter, joiner’. Although the Indo-European verb-root from which <em>tektōn</em> is derived, *<em>tek(s)</em>-, is no longer attested in Greek, it does in fact survive in Latin as <em>texō</em>, which can refer to the craft of woodworking, not only the craft of weaving. Correspondingly, although there is no Greek attestation of an abstract noun *<em>ar-ti-</em> derived from the verb-root of <em>ar-ar-iskein</em>, such a noun does in fact survive in Latin as <em>ars</em>, <em>artis</em> ‘craft’.  </p>
