<p>Whoever is ‘best of the Achaeans’ is challenged by Hector to fight him in a one-on-one duel. Hector boasts that he will kill this fighter, still to be named, who will then be entombed inside a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ overlooking the Hellespont, I.07.086, and thus Hector will have a <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that is eternal, I.07.091. The irony here is that the fighter still to be named will be the winner of a future duel with Hector. That fighter will be Achilles, and the eternal <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ will be primarily his. On the other hand, Hector’s wording is on the mark when he says at I.07.086 that the hero who is ‘best of the Achaeans’ will be entombed inside a <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ overlooking the Hellespont. And that hero will be Achilles.  </p>
