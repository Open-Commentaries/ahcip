<p>The divinities Athena and Apollo are not only supporting the Achaeans and the Trojans respectively. They are also opposing the Trojans and the Achaeans respectively. Even more than that, these divinities are also personally antagonistic toward individual heroes: Athena opposes Hector while Apollo opposes Achilles. In this passage, the antagonism between Athena and Hector is particularly evident. When the seer Helenos at I.07.047 addresses his brother Hector by describing him as comparable to the god Zeus himself with respect to Hector’s qualities of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’, the wording of this description is a direct affront to the divinity Athena, who is the goddess of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ personified.  </p>
