<p>Nestor’s story of his fight with Ereuthalion amounts to a lesson about strategy in warfare. A pivotal figure in the story is the predecessor of Ereuthalion: he is <em>Arēi-thoos</em>, at I.07.137 and again at I.07.138, whose name is a combination of themes involving the god Ares and a primary characteristic of Ares: this god runs with the speed of wind, as conveyed by the adjective <em>thoós</em> ‘running, swift’, derived from the verb <em>theein</em> ‘run’.  </p>
