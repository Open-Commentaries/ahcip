<p>In Hector’s imagined scenario of an outcome for his duel with whoever is the ‘best of the Achaeans’, the warrior he will kill be ‘striving to be the best’, as expressed by the verb <em>aristeuein</em>, I.07.090. The corresponding noun, not attested in Homeric diction, is <em>aristeiā</em> ‘epic high point’, on which see the comment on I.05.103.  </p>
