<p>By goading the Achaeans, Nestor is engaged in the act of <em>neikeîn</em>: so he ‘quarrels with’ the Achaeans. This way, he engages in the language of blame as opposed to praise. And, even before Nestor starts blaming the Achaeans, Menelaos has already engaged in his own act of <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’, I.07.095.  </p>
