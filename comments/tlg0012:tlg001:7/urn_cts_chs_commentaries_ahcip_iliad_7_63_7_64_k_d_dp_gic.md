<p>The noun <em>phríx</em> ‘shuddering’, which conveys the subjectivized feeling of an observer who shudders when he looks at the sea being stirred up by the West Wind named Zephyros while feeling the sudden blast of the wind, is related not only formally but even thematically to the “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) of <em>Phríxos</em>, a hero who escaped the dangers of the <em>pontos</em> ‘[sea-] crossing’ that is the Hellespont, as we read in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 4.160–161. The wording of Pindar goes on to say there that Phríxos was ‘saved’, <em>saōthē</em>, because he was carried to safety by the ram with the golden fleece. Before the occurrence of the name Zephyros here at I.07.063, the same name for the West Wind has occurred in previous similes: I.02.147, I.04.276, 04.423. In a forthcoming simile showing the sea stirred up by the North Wind named Boreas together with the West Wind named Zephyros, I.09.004–008, the subjective feeling of fear that overcomes the observer is described as <em>kruoeis</em> ‘chilling’, I.09.002. So, the observer shudders at the chilling power of the storm at sea. The stormy combination of Boreas and Zephyros is described as stirring up the <em>pontos</em> ‘sea[-crossing]’ also at I.23.230, and this sea, described there as ‘Thracian’, is to be equated with the Hellespont.  </p>
