<p>As noted in the previous comment, the tomb of the hero whom Hector imagines he will kill is the tomb of Achilles, who in fact will kill Hector before he dies his own death. For details about the funeral and entombment of Achilles see the comment on I.16.456–457, with special reference to the word <em>tarkhuein</em> ‘ritually prepare’, as attested here at I.07.085.  </p>
