<p>Achilles greets the ambassadors in the dual, I.09.197–198, and not in the plural. And he refers to them first as <em>philoi</em> ‘near and dear’, I.09.197, and then as the <em>philtatoi</em> ‘most near and dear’ among the Achaeans, I.09.198; again at I.09.204, he refers to them as <em>philtatoi</em> ‘most near and dear’. But are the ambassadors really at the very top of this hero’s ascending scale of affection? The dual construction of the verb in the syntax of I.09.197 might indicate that one of the three ambassadors is being left out of the hero’s reference to his nearest and dearest friends among all the Achaeans. The ambassador who might be left out is Odysseus. At I.09.312–313, Achilles says to Odysseus: whoever says one thing but means another thing is as <em>ekhthros</em> ‘hateful’ to me as the Gates of Hādēs, I.09.313.  </p>
