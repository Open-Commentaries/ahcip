<p>As Odysseus warns, I.09.249, Achilles will suffer <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ in some unforeseeable way if he does not help the Achaeans right now. And there will be no <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ for the pain of this grief, I.09.250. The warning will come true, since the future death of Patroklos will turn Achilles into <em>a man of constant sorrow</em>. See especially the comment on I.18.015–073; also the comment on I.23.046–047. Of special interest here at I.09.249–250 is the morphological parallelism of <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ at I.09.249 with <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ at I.09.250. Another morphological parallel for <em>akos</em> ‘remedy’ is the synonym <em>althos</em> ‘remedy’. Whereas <em>akos</em> and <em>althos</em> are synonyms, they are both antonyms of <em>akhos</em>, and the morphological parallelism of all three words serves to highlight the semantic contrast of <em>akhos</em> on one side with <em>akos</em> and <em>althos</em> on the other side. The morphological parallelism extends to names derived from the antonyms <em>althos</em> and <em>akhos</em>, since <em>althos</em> ‘remedy’ is to <em>Althaiā</em> as <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ is to <em>Akhaiā</em> (see BA 88).  </p>
