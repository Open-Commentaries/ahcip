<p>Here at I.09.561–564, it is revealed that Kleopatra had a second “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>), and that this name had to do with the singing of laments. Her second name was <em>Alkuónē</em>, I.09.562, which was given to her as a reminder of sorrows suffered by her mother, who is said to have lamented just as a songbird laments, I.09.562–564. The lamenting songbird here is the <em>halkúōn</em> ‘halcyon’, described as <em>polupenthēs</em> ‘having much grief’, I.09.563. See also the comments on I.22.483 and on Ι.24.708, analyzing further contexts where <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ is connected with singing songs of ritual lament.  </p>
