<p>In these first four verses of the speech spoken by Odysseus to Achilles, there is an evocative reference to the <em>dais</em> as a ‘feast’ where portions of meat are being divided in an equitable way, I.09.225. The wording seems to evoke an epic scene where Odysseus and Achilles attended a <em>dais</em> ‘feast’ and quarreled. Such an epic scene is narrated at O.08.072–083.  </p>
