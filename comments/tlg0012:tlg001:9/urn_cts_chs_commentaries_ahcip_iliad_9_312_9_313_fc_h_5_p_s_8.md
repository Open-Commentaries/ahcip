<p>Achilles expresses here his hostility toward Odysseus: someone who says one thing and means another thing is as <em>ekhthros</em> ‘hateful’ to Achilles as the Gates of Hādēs. If in fact Odysseus has misrepresented the offer of Agamemnon by leaving out the part of the offer that would have compromised the epic status of Achilles, then Odysseus is <em>ekhthros</em> ‘hateful’ and thus not <em>philos</em> ‘near and dear’ to Achilles. And that is why it can be argued that the earlier wording of Achilles in greeting the ambassadors is designed to exclude Odysseus from the company of those who are near and dear. See the comment on I.09.193–198. There is, then, a traditional enmity between these two heroes.  </p>
