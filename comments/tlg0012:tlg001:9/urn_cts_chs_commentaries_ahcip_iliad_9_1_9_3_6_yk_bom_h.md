<p>The beginning of Rhapsody 9 picks up where Rhapsody 8 ended. There is a brief reference at I.09.001 to the ending of Rhapsody 8. Then, in the rest of the verse at I.09.001 and continuing into I.09.002–003 there is a transition into the narrative as it now resumes. A fitting term for this sort of transition is <em>rhapsodic sequencing</em>. Here as elsewhere, the transition of the narrative from one rhapsody to the next shows that each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Iliad</em>—and each one of the 24 rhapsodies of the <em>Odyssey</em>—is a distinct unit of performance. In the classical period of Athens, as we see in Plato’s <em>Ion</em>, professional performers of Homeric rhapsodies were known as <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’. The term <em>rhapsōidiā</em>, translated in this comment as ‘rhapsody’, originates from the traditions of <em>rhapsōidoi</em> ‘rhapsodes’ who performed poetry in competitive relay with other rhapsodes. Accordingly, the <em>rhapsōidiai</em> ‘rhapsodies’ of Homeric poetry can be seen as units of relay performance. </p>
