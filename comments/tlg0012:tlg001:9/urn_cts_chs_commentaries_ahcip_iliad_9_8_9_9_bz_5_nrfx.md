<p>After the intervening simile, at I.09.004–008, of the storm at sea, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ felt by the Achaeans at I.09.003 is described further: this grief, it is said at I.09.008, is felt by them inside their collective ‘heart’, as expressed by <em>thūmos</em>. But then, at I.09.009, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ of I.09.003 is now reconfigured as the <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ felt by the leader of the Achaeans, Agamemnon, in his individuated ‘heart’, as expressed this time by <em>ētor</em>, which is a partial synonym of <em>thūmos</em>. In this ring-composition, the <em>penthos</em> ‘grief’ of verse 3 comes full circle with the synonym <em>akhos</em> ‘grief’ of verse 9, but the circle has in the meantime rotated the perspective from a collective to an individuated ‘heart’.  </p>
