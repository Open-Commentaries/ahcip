<p>At I.07.063–064, we saw that a young hero named <em>Phríxos</em> escaped the dangers of the <em>póntos</em> ‘[sea-] crossing’ that is the Hellespont, as we read in Pindar <em>Pythian</em> 4.160–161: Pindar’s wording goes on to say that Phríxos was ‘saved’, <em>saōthē</em>, because he was carried to safety by the ram with the golden fleece. But the young heroine <em>Héllē</em>, who was the sister of Phrixos, did not escape the dangers: she fell off the ram and drowned in the stormy waters of the Hellespont, as we read in Apollodorus 1.9.1. That is why the Hellespont is named after her: <em>Hellḗs</em>-<em>pontos</em> means ‘the [sea-] crossing of <em>Hellē</em>’.  </p>
