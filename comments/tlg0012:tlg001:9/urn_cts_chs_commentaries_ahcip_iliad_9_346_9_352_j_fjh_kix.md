<p>Achilles in his speech here returns to something that Odysseus had said at I.09.241–243: how the Achaeans are afraid that Hector’s fire will reach their ships beached at the Hellespont, and that such a disaster would surely destroy them. Achilles now gives a biting response at I.09.347: let Agamemnon find a way to ward off the fire of Hector without the help of Achilles. The verb used here for the idea of finding a way, <em>phrazesthai</em> ‘devise a plan’, is correlated with the noun <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in Homeric diction, as we see in the wording of Achilles at a later point, I.09.423. Since Odysseus is the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’ in Homeric poetry, Achilles is in effect saying to him at I.09.347: let Agamemnon rely on your <em>mētis</em>, Odysseus, since he cannot any longer rely on my <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’. As we see in another comment, Achilles is the primary exponent of <em>biē</em> ‘force, violence’ in Homeric poetry, just as Odysseus is the primary exponent of <em>mētis</em> ‘mind, intelligence’. According to the Scholia A for I.09.347, Aristarchus apparently thought that the passage we are now considering, I.09.346–352, was an allusion to another passage, O.08.072–083, which is about a quarrel that once took place between Achilles and Odysseus over one overriding question: will Troy be conquered by relying on the physical power of Achilles or on the mental power of Odysseus?</p>
