<p>The words of Phoenix warn against the dangers of <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’, I.09.512. The <em>Litai</em>, goddesses of supplication personified, I.09.502, afflict with <em>atē</em> a man who does wrong by showing cruelty to suppliants and rejecting their supplications, I.09.510–512. The warning here is intended for Achilles. But why is it that Achilles should heed the <em>Litai</em>? An answer emerges at I.09.507, where the <em>Litai</em> are said to heal the damage caused by the <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’ that is committed by wrongdoers when these wrongdoers offer compensation for such <em>atē</em>. As we saw in the comment on I.09.115–120, Agamemnon admits his <em>atē</em> ‘aberration, for which he stands ready to offer <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.09.120. In rejecting the <em>Litai</em>, one is rejecting the process whereby compensation can be awarded for damage suffered—and the word for ‘damage’ is <em>Atē</em> personified at I.09.504 and I.09.505. Further, the punishment for such refusal is another round of <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’—this time suffered by the one who rejects the <em>Litai</em>, I.09.510–512. For Achilles, such an <em>atē</em> would be the death of his other self, Patroklos, who personally experiences <em>atē</em> at the moment of his death, I.16.805, in the form of an aberration of the senses. See the comments on I.16.685–687 and on I.16.804–806. At I.19.268–275, Achilles seems to recognize that both he and Agamemnon have in the end been afflicted with <em>atē</em>.  </p>
