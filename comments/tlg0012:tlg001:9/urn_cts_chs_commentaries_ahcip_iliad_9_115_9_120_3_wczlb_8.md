<p>Agamemnon here at I.09.115 admits that it was <em>atē</em> for him to dishonor Achilles. In such a context, the noun <em>atē</em> can be translated as an ‘aberration’. The noun is used here in the plural, <em>atai</em>, indicating specific instances of aberration, not just an overall error. After all, in his quarrel with Achilles, Agamemnon insulted the prime hero of the <em>Iliad</em> in multiple ways. Agamemnon goes on to say that he is ready to pay <em>apoina</em> ‘compensation’, I.09.120, for his aberrations. For Achilles to reject this compensation has its own risks, as we see in the comment on I.09.502–512: here too, there is a danger of <em>atē</em> ‘aberration’, Ι.09.512.  </p>
