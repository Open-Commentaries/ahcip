<p>From the standpoint of its etymology, derived as it is from the verb <em>keirein</em> ‘cut, slice’, the noun <em>kḗr</em> in the sense of a ‘cut’ or a ‘slice’ or a ‘portion’ need not convey the negative idea of a ‘fated death’. When a hero chooses between two alternative <em>kêres</em> or ‘fates’, one of the two alternatives may be death but the other may be life. Thus when Achilles here speaks of two alternative <em>kêres</em> or ‘fates’ that may await him, namely, either the <em>kleos</em> or ‘glory’ that he will get if he dies young in the Trojan War or the <em>nostos</em> or ‘homecoming’ that will be his if he abandons that war, the second alternative is not really a ‘fated death’ for Achilles as is the first alternative. Instead, a <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ would give him life. But this life would be limited. It would last only until the hero’s age runs out of time, just as the age of a plant will surely run out of time. Conversely, the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that the hero would get from dying young in the Trojan War would have an unlimited life of its own, because this <em>kleos</em> is conferred by poetry, and this poetry is held to be imperishable.</p>
