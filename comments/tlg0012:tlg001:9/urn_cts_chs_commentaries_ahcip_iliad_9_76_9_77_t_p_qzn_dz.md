<p>Nestor makes a remark about the watchfires of the Trojans: these fires, he says, are too close for comfortâ€”too close, that is, to the beached ships of the Achaeans. We see here a premonition of the Battle for the Ships and of the fire of Hector, which will threaten to burn down the ships and thus destroy the Achaeans.  </p>
