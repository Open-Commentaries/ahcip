<p>The name <em>Phúza</em>, which is a personification of <em>phúza</em> ‘running away out of fear’ is described here at I.09.02 as the <em>hetaírē</em> ‘companion’ of <em>Phóbos</em>, which is a personification of <em>phóbos</em> ‘turning and running out of fear’. The immediate context is that the Trojans are now winning while the Achaeans are losing, I.09.1–2. The verse-final feminine form <em>hetaírē</em>, a morphologically leveled replacement of the older feminine form <em>hétairă</em>, likewise meaning ‘companion’, occurs only here in the <em>Iliad</em>. In this case, the morphological leveling can be explained as a replacement of the alternation *-́<em>i̯ă</em>-/-<em>i̯ā́</em>- by way of non-alternating *-<em>i̯ā́</em>-. In the <em>Odyssey</em> as well, feminine <em>hetaírē</em> occurs only once, O.17.271. Elsewhere in the Homeric tradition, feminine <em>hetaírē</em> occurs only in <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> 31 and 478. In all three of these other occurrences as well, <em>hetaírē</em> is verse-final. The application of <em>hetaírē</em> to <em>Phúza</em> here at I.09.02 is comparable to the application of the vocalically rhyming form <em>krataiḗ</em> to <em>Moîra</em>, personification of <em>moîra</em> in the sense of ‘fate, destiny’. This form <em>krataiḗ</em>, which is likewise verse-final, is found nine times in the <em>Iliad</em> but not once in the <em>Odyssey</em>. For the occurrences, see the comment on I.05.083. As in the case of <em>hetaírē</em>, this feminine form <em>krataiḗ</em> can be explained as a morphologically leveled replacement of an older feminine form, to be reconstructed as *<em>krataí-u̯i-ă</em> and meaning ‘whose power [*<em>u̯i</em>-] has the upper-hand [<em>krátos</em>]’. In this case as well, the morphological leveling involves a replacement of the alternation *-́<em>i̯ă</em>-/-<em>i̯ā́</em>- by way of non-alternating *-<em>i̯ā́</em>-. </p>
