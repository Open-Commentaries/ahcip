<p>This adjective <em>adeukḗs</em> occurs in contexts referring to an interrupted sequence. Nausicaa is concerned that the Phaeacians may say something, as expressed by the noun <em>phēmis</em> ‘something said’, that is <em>adeukḗs</em> for her reputation. Good reputation is conceived as a steady stream of speech, the interruption of which threatens to produce a bad reputation.  </p>
