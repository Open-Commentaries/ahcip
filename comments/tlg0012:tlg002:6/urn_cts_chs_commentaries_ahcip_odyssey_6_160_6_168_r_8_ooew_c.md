<p>Odysseus here compares Nausicaa in all her beauty to a sacred <em>phoinix</em> ‘date palm’, O.06.163, which is located next to the altar of the god Apollo at Delos, O.06.162. The <em>phoinix</em> is also mentioned in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Apollo</em> 18 and 117. Odysseus claims to have seen this date palm with his own eyes when he visited Delos, O.06.163–165. This mention of Delos is a rare Homeric reference to locales that are distinctly Ionian in culture (HPC 227). Also, we see epic distancing here (Taplin 1996): back in the age of heroes, the date palm was still young and small, O.06.166–168—much smaller than it is imagined to be in the post-heroic age. </p>
