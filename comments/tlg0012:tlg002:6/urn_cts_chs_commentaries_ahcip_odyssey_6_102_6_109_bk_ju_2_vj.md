<p>Nausicaa is compared directly to the goddess Artemis: just as Nausicaa is the prima donna / prima ballerina in relation to the group of singing / dancing girls who attend her, so also is Artemis in relation to the group of nymphs that correspondingly attend her, O.06.105; their singing / dancing here is expressed by way of the word <em>paizein</em> ‘play’ at I.06.106, corresponding to the singing / dancing of Nausicaa and of the girls attending her at I.06.100–101. </p>
