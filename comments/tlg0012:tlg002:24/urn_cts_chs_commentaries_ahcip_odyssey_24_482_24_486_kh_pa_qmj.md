<p>Zeus’ speech here offers a solution to what may appear to be the beginning of a continuous cycle of violence and one of the tensions set up early in the poem. The speech recalls that of Telemakhos’ to the assembly, which forecast the threat of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors and Ithacans (<em>Od</em>. 2.63-69). Instead of the extension of the retributive power of <em>mēnis</em> to the suitors’ solidarity group, however, Zeus here proposes to cancel it with the help of divinely inspired total forgetting of the suitors and their killing (ἔκλησιν, <em>Od</em>. 24.485). We can see that <em>lēthē</em> is opposed not only to memory, but also to its flipside <em>mēnis</em>. Furthermore, by comparing Zeus’ speech with that of Mentor’s in the assembly, another way in which it resolves the tensions set up in the poem becomes apparent: just as Mentor says that the Ithacans deserve a harsh ruler for not remembering how kind a ruler Odysseus was (<em>Od</em>. 2.230-234), here Zeus promises that Odysseus will in fact continue to rule, and there will be love between him and his subjects. This outcome, too, depends on the <em>eklēsis</em>, and so we can see that the ills resulting from <em>mēnis</em> and not remembering are both countered by this divine forgetting, further underlining their parallelism.</p>
