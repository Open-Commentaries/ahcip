<p>Odysseus shows to Laertes his tell-tale scar, O.24.331, after the father asks his son for a <em>sēma</em> ‘sign, signal’ as proof of identity. Odysseus then also proves that he knows every detail about the Garden of Laertes, O.24.336–346. These <em>sēmata</em> ‘signs, signals’, O.24.346, are now recognized by Laertes, and the verb that signals such recognition is once again <em>gignōskein</em> ‘recognize’.  </p>
