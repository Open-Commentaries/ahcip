<p>As the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors are being conducted by the god Hermes toward their ultimate otherworldly destination, which is unspecified, they come to a place called the Meadow of Asphodel, O.24.013, which is an abode for <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ described here as <em>eidōla</em> ‘images’ of the dead, O.24.014. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, I.23.072 and O.11.476, this same description applies to disembodied spirits of the dead who populate a mystical place that resembles what is known in other contexts as Hādēs. But the Meadow of Asphodel is not exactly Hādēs. Elsewhere in Homeric diction, this Meadow is where the spirit of Achilles himself abides, O.11.539. Also, at O.11.573, the Meadow of Asphodel is pictured as a “happy hunting ground”—to borrow an image from the Great Plains tribes of native Americans—where the great hunter Orion can hunt for all time to his heart’s content, O.11.572–575. In the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em>, verses 221 and 344, the same Meadow of Asphodel becomes a pathway for the Cattle of the Sun after Hermes steals this solar herd from Apollo. And now, as we see here at O.O.24.013 just as we saw earlier at O.11.539, the Meadow of Asphodel is once again featured as the place where the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles is to be found: here he is, in the company of other <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’, who are listed in the following order: Patroklos, Antilokhos, Ajax, O.24.015–018. In this same context, Ajax is described as the second-best of the Achaeans, after Achilles, O.24.017–018. This company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ is now joined by the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon, who is coming from some other direction, at the head of another company of <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’—those who had been killed together with Agamemnon by Aigisthos after they had made their way back home from Troy, O.24.021–022. At this point, we might have expected the <em>psūkhē</em> of Agamemnon to address the <em>psūkhai</em> ‘spirits’ of the dead suitors, asking them directly: how did <em>you</em> all die? And then I will tell you how we died. But such a dialogue is postponed till O.24.099–105. Instead, here at O.24.023, it is Achilles himself—or, let us say, it is his <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’—who initiates a dialogue with the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon. You would think that the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Achilles had only now for the first time encountered the <em>psūkhē</em> ‘spirit’ of Agamemnon since he died. But, as we will see at O.24.024–034, Achilles already knows what happened to Agamemnon and to his followers after they had made their way back home from Troy: they died an ignominious death, through the treachery of Aigisthos. Conversely, as we will see at O.24.036–097, Agamemnon already knows what happened to Achilles: he never went home because he died at Troy, but his glorious death there earned him the greatest honors.  </p>
