<p>Here at O.24.520, Athena ‘breathes’ into Laertes the ‘mental power’ that he needs to be victorious, as expressed respectively by <em>pneîn</em> and <em>menos</em> This situation is the converse of ‘breathing-out [<em>pneîn</em>] mental-power [<em>menos</em>]’, as attested at O.22.203. For other situations where a divinity breathes <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’ into a hero, see the comments at  I.10.482, I.11.508, I.15.059–060, I.15.262.  </p>
