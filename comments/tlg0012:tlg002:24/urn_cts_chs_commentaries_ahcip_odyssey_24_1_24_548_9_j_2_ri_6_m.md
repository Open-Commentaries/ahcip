<p>Before the <em>Odyssey</em> comes to an end, the Singer of Tales reaches back to what seems to be the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>. It is as if the second epic, the <em>Odyssey</em>, could now restart before it ends by reaching back into the first epic, the <em>Iliad</em>. Still, there will be no restart here. The plot of that first epic had started with a grand feud between Achilles and Agamemnon, but the plot of the second epic will now come to an end with a resolution of that feud. The feuding is over, so that the two main characters of the <em>Iliad</em> can now take time to review not only what happened in the <em>Iliad</em> but also, beyond the <em>Iliad</em>, how the two of them died, each his own way. Since they are now dead, they have to speak ghost to ghost, but that is not enough for Agamemnon. He must also speak with the new ghosts, the suitors, who will now give him a retrospective on the <em>Odyssey</em>. This way, Agamemnon can compare the story of his own life with the stories of both Odysseus and Achilles. And the comparison must be most depressing for him. But the Odyssey does not end with the sad thoughts of Agamemnon. Odysseus still has to reconnect with his own ancestors, and so there needs to be a final recognition scene between the son and his father Laertes. But even after this reconnection of the generations is finally achieved, the story is still not done. The feuding that has been triggered by the killing of the suitors must end; otherwise, the story cannot end.</p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/T11219_10_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>“Mercury Conducting the Souls of the Suitors to the Infernal Regions” (1805).
