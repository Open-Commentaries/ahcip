<p>The name of this <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ Phemios is a “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>): the adjectival <em>Phēmios</em> is derived from the noun <em>phēmē</em>, defined in the comment at O.02.035 as ‘something said that means more than what is meant by the one who says it’. Accordingly, as I note in the same comment, Phemios is a singer whose songs mean more than what is meant by that singer. On the content of what Phemios sings, see the comment on O.01.342. For still more on the content, see the comment at O.22.376, where we see that an epithet of this singer is <em>poluphēmos</em> having many different kinds of things said’. Not only the name <em>Phēmios</em> is a “speaking name”: so too is the patronymic of this singer, <em>Terpiadēs</em>, O.22.330, derived from the verb <em>terpein</em> meaning ‘give delight’. On the poetic connotations of this verb, see especially the comment at O.08.026–045.</p>
