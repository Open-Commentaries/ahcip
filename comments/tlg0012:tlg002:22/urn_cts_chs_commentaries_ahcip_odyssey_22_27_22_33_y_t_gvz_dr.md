<p>Seeing that Odysseus has just now shot an arrow that has killed the suitor Antinoos, the rest of the suitors are feeling outraged, assuming as they do that this killing was accidental, O.22.031–032. They revile Odysseus, whom they still fail to recognize, exclaiming that he has accidentally shot the very best of all the young men in Ithaca, O.22.029–030. In effect, they are delusionally assuming that Odysseus has killed the best of the Achaeans in Ithaca. They exclaim further that they will kill the would-be beggar and feed his corpse to vultures, O.22.030, adding derisively: <em>so, don’t expect to win some prize for this shot of the arrow</em>, O.22.027–028. And the word that is used here at O.22.027 for ‘prize’ is <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>), O.22.027. Whereas the masculine noun <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) refers to the ritualized ‘ordeal’ of competition, as noted in the comment at O.22.005, the neuter noun <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>) ordinarily refers to a ‘prize’ that is won in the competition—as also noted in the comment at O.22.005.  </p>
