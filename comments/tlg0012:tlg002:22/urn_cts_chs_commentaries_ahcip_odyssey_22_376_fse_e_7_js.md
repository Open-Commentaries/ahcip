<p>The description of the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ here at O.22.376 as <em>poluphēmos</em> ‘having many different kinds of things said’ is relevant what is noted in the comments at O.01.342 and O.02.035: the content of the epic songs sung by this singer could be understood differently by different listeners. See also the comment at O.22.330–331 and, further back, at O.12.184.  </p>
