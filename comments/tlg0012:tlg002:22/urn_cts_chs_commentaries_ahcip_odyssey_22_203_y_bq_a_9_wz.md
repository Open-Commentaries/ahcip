<p>On the infusion of strength as by way divinely breathing it into the hero and thus reminding him of his own <em>menos</em> in the sense of his ‘power’, see the comments at I.11.508, I.15.059–060, I.15.262. Here at O.22.203, the <em>menos</em> ‘power’ that is breathed-out had been presumably breathed-in by divine agency.  </p>
