<p>At O.22.285–286, the cowherd Philoitios kills the suitor Ktesippos, who had thrown at the disguised Odysseus a most lowly portion of beef as a physical insult that augmented his verbal insults during the feast that followed the sacrifice of one hundred cattle in celebration of the festival of Apollo. See the comment at O.20.292–302. Then at O.22.287–291, having killed the suitor, the cowherd mocks the dead Ktesippos for having mistreated a lowly guest who should have really been the kingly host at the feast celebrating the festival of Apollo. In mocking Ktesippos here, the cowherd resorts to the language of blame: he addresses the dead suitor as ‘son of Poluthersēs’, where this “speaking name” (<em>nomen loquens</em>) <em>Polu-thersēs</em> means ‘he who has much boldness [<em>tharsos</em>]’, O.22.287. Such a name is parallel to <em>Thersītēs</em>, the name of a character in the <em>Iliad</em> who is represented as a blame poet of the worst kind. Philoitios also addresses the dead Ktesippos as <em>philo-kertomos</em> ‘lover of insults, O.22.287. On <em>kertomeîn</em> ‘say words of insult’ as used in the language of blame poetry, see the comments at I.02.256, O.02.323, O.18.350; also at O.20.263.  </p>
