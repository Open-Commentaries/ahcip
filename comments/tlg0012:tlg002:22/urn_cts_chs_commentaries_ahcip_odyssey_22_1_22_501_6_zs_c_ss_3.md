<p>At the end of Rhapsody 21, Odysseus has already passed, in rapid succession, two of three successive tests that needed to be endured by the true king of Ithaca. That is, he has already performed a stringing of his mighty bow and has already won an ultimate contest in archery by executing a perfect shot with the very first arrow that he shoots from the bow. But now, at the beginning of Rhapsody 22, the third test awaits Odysseus. He must now kill the suitors, and the successive killings that follow will ultimately eliminate all the would-be husbands of Penelope. In the end, Odysseus will be the only Achaean left standing. And he has by now been revealed as the only true husband, the only true king. So, he has become the best of the Achaeans in the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>. But a question remains. Now that all the suitors have been killed, what will happen to the other characters in the <em>Odyssey</em> who had turned against the king in the course of his lengthy absence? Here is where things get really ugly. The extreme cruelty of the retribution that awaits these characters, as we see it narrated here in <em>Odyssey</em> 22, presents the modern reader with moral problems that cannot be evaded. </p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Attic_red-figure_skyphos%E2%80%94Odysseus_slays_the_suitors_of_his_wife_Penelope_1280.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Odysseus kiling Penelopeâ€™s suitors.
