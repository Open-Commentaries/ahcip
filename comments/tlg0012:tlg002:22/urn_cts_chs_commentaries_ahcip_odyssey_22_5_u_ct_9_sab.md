<p>As noted in the comment at O.22.001–125, Odysseus passes three tests in proving that he is the lawful husband of Penelope and the genuine king of Ithaca: (1) the stringing of the bow, (2) the contest in archery, and (3) the killing of the suitors. Here at O.22.005, we see that the Greek word referring to the second test, the contest in archery, is <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) ‘ordeal’. Now that he has performed his winning shot, Odysseus is saying that the contest has ‘reached an outcome’, as expressed by the verb <em>ek-teleîn</em>, O.22.005. On the use of this word <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>) ‘ordeal’ with reference to the heroic Labors of Hēraklēs, see the comment at O.11.620–624. On the use of this same word with reference to the ‘ordeals’ of warfare, see the comments at I.03.125–128; also at O.03.262 and O.04.170. On its use with reference to contests in athletics, see the comment at O.08.096–103. The masculine noun <em>aethlos</em> (<em>āthlos</em>), in referring to the ritualized ‘ordeal’ of <em>āthlētai</em> ‘athletes’, is correlated with the neuter noun <em>aethlon</em> (<em>āthlon</em>), which refers to a ‘prize’ that is won in competition among athletes.</p>
