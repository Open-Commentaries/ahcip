<p>In situations of strife among heroes as warriors, there is contention over status. Quarreling happens, as indicated here by way of the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’. Positive things about each warrior need to be praised, but negative things need to be blamed. At stake for each contending warrior-hero is the honor that he is apportioned in the course of any contention, and the contention itself is expressed by way of negative and positive speech, that is, by way of blame and praise respectively. Such an apportioning of honor is the essence of a warrior-hero’s aisa, which is visualized not only as a portion of plundered goods that gets apportioned to each warrior after such goods are communally divided (as at I.18.327) but also, in general, as a warrior’s ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.01.416, and so on). The same can be said about the word <em>moira</em>, which can mean not only a ‘portion’ of plundered goods (as at O.11.534) or even of sacrificial meat (as at O.03.066) but also, in general, ‘fate, destiny’ (as at I.06.488, and so on). What is at stake, in the long run, is the aisa or moira of each contending warrior-hero. And this <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em>, in the sense of a ‘portion’ that is being apportioned, becomes the warrior’s ‘fate’ or ‘destiny’ in the poetry that tells about him. To restate in colloquial English: <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> becomes the “bone of contention” in the language of praise and blame. Here at I.03.059 as also at I.06.333, Paris actually accepts the words of blame directed at him by his quarreling brother. He says that these words fit his own <em>aisa</em>, admitting that Hector’s words of blame here are <em>kat’ aisan</em> ‘in accord with <em>aisa’</em> (κατ’ αἶσαν) and not <em>huper aisan</em> ‘in disaccord with <em>aisa’</em> (ὑπὲρ αἶσαν). We find in Homeric diction comparable combinations of <em>moira</em>, synonym of <em>aisa</em>, with the same adverbs/prepositions <em>kata</em> ‘in accord with’ and <em>huper</em> ‘in disaccord with’, as for example in the case of <em>kata moiran</em> at I.09.059 (κατὰ μοῖραν) and <em>huper moiran</em> at I.20.336 (ὑπὲρ μοῖραν). Further, when the actual words of praise or blame fit the <em>aisa</em> or <em>moira</em> of a given warrior-hero, they will fit not only his destiny but even the overall plot of the epic, as at I.16.707 in the case of <em>aisa</em> and at Ι.16.853 in the case of <em>moira</em>. The plot of epic has a destiny of its own, and this overarching destiny integrates all the individual destinies of the heroes who populate the epic.  </p>
