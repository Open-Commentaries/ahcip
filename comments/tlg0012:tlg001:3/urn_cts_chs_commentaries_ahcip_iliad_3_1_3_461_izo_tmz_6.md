<p>The Master Narrator of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> is looking here at Helen for the very first time—or, to say it more accurately, as if for the very first time. Just as Rhapsody 2 needed a new Catalogue of Ships—or, again to say it more accurately—a renewed Catalogue, so also Rhapsody 3 needs a new look at Helen. It seems as if the Trojan War is happening all over again, starting from the very beginning. The old grievances of Menelaos about the abduction of Helen by Paris can now be renewed and even relived, becoming fresh new grievances as the estranged husband and the new lover proceed to engage in mortal combat. But this one-on-one struggle over life and death will soon modulate into a renewal of all-out war between the Achaeans and the Trojans.</p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Antalya_Museum_-_Sarkophag_5b_Aphrodite_verbirgt_Paris_1280.jpg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Menelaos pulling Paris by the helmet.
