<p>The Trojan War is <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. See also <em>eris</em> ‘strife’ at Pindar <em>Paean</em> 6.50–53. That is how this war is seen in the words of Menelaos the Achaean, who claims a juridical grievance on the part of the Achaeans against the Trojans. In terms of the thinking revealed by these words, the beginning of the strife was the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaos the Achaean, by Paris the Trojan. Accentuating the idea that this juridical grievance of Menelaos was an affair of state is the reference to Paris here by way of his princely name, Alexandros. In royal Hittite correspondences where the Hittite king speaks to and about the king of Ahhiyawa—which is the Hittite way of referring to the land of the Achaeans—we find occasional references to a princely figure by the name of <em>Alaksandu</em>, which is the Hittite pronunciation of Alexandros (Nagy 2015.07.22§25). By contrast, the name <em>Paris</em> is on the surface merely a shepherd’s name (on the symbolism, however, of the shepherd as a king-in-the-making, see Nagy 2009:309). In any case, the <em>eris</em> or ‘strife’ between the Achaeans and the Trojans was caused by ‘my strife’— according to Menelaos the Achaean. To say it more precisely in his words, the Trojan War was ‘because of my strife’ (εἵνεκ’ ἐμῆς ἔριδος). Correspondingly, the <em>arkhē</em> or ‘beginning’ of the strife as begun by Paris=Alexandros was ‘his beginning’ of that strife. To say it again more precisely in the words of Menelaos, the beginning of the Trojan War was ‘because of the beginning on the part of Paris=Alexandros’ (Ἀλεξάνδρου ἕνεκ’ ἀρχῆς). Here it is important to compare what was narrated in the <em>Cypria</em>, which as an epic belonging to a set of epics known as the epic Cycle. In the <em>Cypria</em> of the epic Cycle as also in the <em>Iliad</em>, the Trojan War is likewise seen as <em>eris</em> ‘strife’. As we read in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em> in Proclus 102.13–19 (ed. Allen 1912), it all began at a feast celebrating the marriage of Thetis and Peleus—a marriage that led to the conception of Achilles himself. It was the Will of Zeus that <em>Eris</em> ‘Strife’ personified would bring about a <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ among the gods that would ultimately result in the Trojan War (Proclus 102.14/15 on <em>Eris</em>/<em>neikos</em>). As we see further in the plot-summary of the <em>Cypria</em>, Proclus 102.14–19, the Eris/neikos extends to the figure of Paris, who has to choose from among Hērā, Athena, and Aphrodite, <em>Cypria</em>/Proclus 102.14–19. This Judgment of Paris is recapitulated at I.24.025–030: the fact that Paris chose Aphrodite means that he aimed negative words at Hērā and Athena, as expressed by the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ at I.24.029 (νείκεσσε), while he aimed positive words at Aphrodite, as expressed by the verb <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ at I.24.030 (ᾔνησ᾽). These verbs <em>aineîn</em> ‘praise’ and <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ express both the social and the poetic significance of praise and blame respectively.  </p>
