<p>Helen is seen here at I.03.125–128 for the first time in the <em>Iliad</em>. She is shown in the act of pattern-weaving. Instead of singing while weaving, she weaves her song into the web that she pattern-weaves. See also the comment on I.22.440–441, where comparable wording shows Andromache weaving a web of her own. In the case of Helen at I.03.125–128 here, the song that she weaves into her web is about the <em>aethloi</em> (<em>āthloi</em>) ‘ordeals’ of war suffered by Trojans and Achaeans alike—a war they suffered all because of her. The song of the Trojan War is the song of the <em>Iliad</em>—and it is Helen’s song. Purple is the dominant color of Helen’s web, matching the blood of war that stains her song. There also exists, however, a variant epithet for the web that Helen weaves at I.03.126: this diplax ‘pattern-woven fabric that folds in two’ is described in some medieval manuscripts as <em>porphureē</em> ‘purple’ but in others as <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’. For more on this variant <em>marmareē</em> ‘gleaming’, see the comment on I.22.440-441 on the web of Andromache.  </p>
