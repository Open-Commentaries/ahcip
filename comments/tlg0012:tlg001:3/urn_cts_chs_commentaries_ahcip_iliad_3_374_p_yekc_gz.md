<p>The epithet <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, applied here to Aphrodite, can signal the beneficence of such goddesses toward privileged heroes like, in this case, Paris=Alexandros. In general, this epithet is applied to the following goddesses: Aphrodite, as here at I.03.374, also at I.05.131 and I.05.312; Athena at I.02.548 and I.04.128 and I.04.515; Artemis at O.20.061; Persephone at O.11.217; Ate at I.19.091; the Muses at I.02.491–492 (plural) and O.01.010 (singular); finally, Helen at O.04.227 (see the comment there). This epithet <em>Dios thugatēr / thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’ is cognate with Vedic Sanskrit<em> divás duhitár-</em> (/ <em>duhitár- divás</em>) ‘daughter of the sky[-god]’, epithet of <em>Uṣas</em>-, goddess of the dawn, whose name actually means ‘dawn’. The Greek divinities Eos and Helios—<em>Ēōs</em> means ‘Dawn’ and <em>Hēlios</em> means ‘Sun’—are comparable to (and cognate with) the Indic divinities <em>Uṣas</em>- ‘Dawn’ and <em>Sūrya</em>- ‘Sun’. In Homeric diction, however, Eos the goddess of the dawn is never described by the epithet <em>thugatēr Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, and this fact corresponds to another fact: Homeric tradition preserves no myth about Eos as a daughter of Zeus. Eos is conventionally described as <em>rhododaktulos</em> ‘rosy-fingered’, an epithet that has the same metrical shape as <em>thugatēr Dios</em>, uu–uu. For more on <em>rhododaktulos</em> as an epithet for Eos the goddess of the dawn, see the comment at O.12.1–010 on Ōkeanos. </p>
