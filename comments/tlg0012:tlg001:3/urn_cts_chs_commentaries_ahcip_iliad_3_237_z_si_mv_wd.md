<p>Kastōr and Poludeukēs, latinized as Castor and Pollux, are the Divine Twins, sons of Zeus. Another name for them is Dioskouroi ‘sons of Zeus’. Kastōr and Poludeukēs are also mentioned at O.11.300. The wording of I.03.237 and of O.11.300 is cognate with the wording we find a fragment of Stesichorus: see PH 458. (On the etymology of <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, I epitomize from PasP 51.) The noun <em>Poludeúkēs</em> as a name is straightforwardly related to the adjective <em>poludeukḗs</em>, in that the recessive accent of the name is typical of the naming function, as we see from such morphologically related formations as <em>Poluneíkēs</em> ‘having many quarrels [es-stem <em>neîkos</em>]’ or ‘having quarrels in many different ways’ (or ‘many times’). In the mythological functions of the divine figure <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, the idea of continuity, conveyed by the root *<em>deuk</em>-, seems as evident as that of variety, since the Divine Twins are models of consistency, perseverance, reliability (as in <em>Homeric Hymn</em> 33). In an astrological sense, we could say that <em>Poludeúkēs</em>, in the role of Morning Star, is ‘repeating many times’, the symbol of many happy returns. (On the Divine Twins as alternating Morning Star / Evening Star, I offer an analysis in GM 258–259.) And the repetition can be visualized as a cyclical one—a pattern of eternal return. There is a striking semantic and morphological parallel in <em>poluderkḗs</em> ‘seeing in many different ways’ (or ‘many times’), epithet of the dawn-goddess Eos in Hesiod (<em>Theogony</em> 451). </p>
