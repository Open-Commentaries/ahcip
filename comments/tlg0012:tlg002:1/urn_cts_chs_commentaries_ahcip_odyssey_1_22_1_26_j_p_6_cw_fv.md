<p>The Olympians habitually go to the realm of the Aethiopians, situated on the banks of the cosmic river Ōkeanos, to dine with them there. The Aethiopians simultaneously inhabit the Far West and the Far East. This simultaneity is a mark of a theme that can best be described as a <em>coincidence of opposites</em>. See the comments on I.01.423–425. Here at O.01.022–026, only Poseidon is visiting the Aethiopians. Unlike other humans, the Aethiopians still dine with the gods. Other humans have been separated from the gods and must therefore sacrifice to them instead of dining with them. </p>
