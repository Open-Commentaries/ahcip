<p>Detail 1.</p><p>I translate <em>hamothen</em> as ‘starting-from-any-single-point-of-departure’ as a way of differentiating this expression from <em>enthen</em> ‘starting-from-that-[specific-]point of departure’ as at O.08.500, where Demodokos starts his narrative at a specific point in the action. </p><p>Detail 2.</p><p>The form <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’ is Aeolic: see the comment at I.01.001. </p><p>Detail 3.</p><p>On the epithet <em>thugatēr</em> (vocative <em>thugater</em>) <em>Dios</em> ‘daughter of Zeus’, see the anchor comment at I.03.374.</p><p>Detail 4.</p><p>I translate <em>eipe kai hēmīn</em>, which means literally ‘tell us also’, as ‘tell-me-as-you-have-told-those-who-came-before-me’ in order to convey the idea that the ‘us’ here refers not only to the ‘me’ of the Master Narrator but also, elliptically, to all the previous master narrators of the <em>Odyssey</em>. In other words, the narration acknowledges not only the horizontal singular ‘me’ of O.01.001 but also the vertical plural succession of performers that led up, in the course of time, to the ultimate ‘me’ of the here-and-now in performance. On ellipsis, the elliptic plural, and the ellipsis of successive ‘I’-s in the ‘we’ of the Master Narrator, see also the comment on I.02.486. On ellipsis in general, see I.04.196; also I.06.209, I.07.015–017. </p>
