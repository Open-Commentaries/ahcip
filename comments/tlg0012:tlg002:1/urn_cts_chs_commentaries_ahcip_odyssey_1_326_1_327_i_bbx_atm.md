<p>The syntax here in O.01.326–327 shows that the use of the noun <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 as the grammatical object of <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’ in the same verse makes this same noun the narrative subject of the song that is being sung by the singer Phemios. The <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ is the song that the singer sings, and so the ‘homecoming’ is also a ‘sing of homecoming’. My translation ‘song of homecoming’ is meant to show that the homecoming is the song. The placement of the adjective <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 as an epithet for the narrative subject <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the previous verse at O.01.326 is parallel to the placement of the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ at I.01.002 as an epithet for the narrative subject <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the previous verse at I.01.001. See the comment on I.01.001–002. Another parallel is the placement of the adjective <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 as an epithet for the preceding narrative subject <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the same verse. There is further parallelism to be noted here. The epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 for the narrative subject <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative here: Athena caused misfortune for some of the Achaeans. Similarly, the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> at I.01.002 for the narrative subject <em>mēnis</em> at I.01.001 is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable misfortune. See the comment on I.01.002. Also, the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 for the preceding narrative subject <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the same verse is immediately followed by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: the hero Odysseus suffered many misfortunes by veering many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. </p>
