<p>Etymologically, the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ indicates <em>consciousness</em> as distinct from the <em>unconsciousness</em> of <em>sleeping</em>, <em>swooning</em>, and <em>death</em> itself. This noun is derived from the verb-root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’. The root *<em>nes</em>- has a deeper meaning as well: ‘come to’, in the sense of ‘come back to consciousness’. Another noun derived from *<em>nes</em>- is <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song of / about homecoming’. This noun nostos also has a deeper meaning: ‘coming back to light and life’. See the comment on O.01.05. Two definitive books on the Greek reflexes of the root *<em>nes</em>- ‘return, come back’: Frame 1978 and 2009. I add here a special note on my translation of O.01.003: ‘Many different cities of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>nóos</em>]’. I translate <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’ here as ‘way[s] of thinking’ because the wording says that Odysseus gets to know different ways of thinking by making contact with many different persons in the course of all his travels. Because he gets to know their different ways of thinking, his knowledge now makes it possible for Odysseus himself to think in many different ways. So he is getting to know his own ‘mind’ differently by getting to know the different minds of others.  </p>
