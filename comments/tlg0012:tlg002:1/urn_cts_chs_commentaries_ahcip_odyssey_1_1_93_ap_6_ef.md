<p>By saying ‘tell me, Muse’, the Master Narrator is saying that the song that he will perform is something that he hears from a goddess who is invoked here as a singular <em>Mousa</em> ‘Muse’. See also I.01.001, where the Master Narrator likewise calls on a singular Muse. Although <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’ here at O.01.001 does not explicitly refer to singing as does <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’ at I.01.001, the narrative that the Master Narrator narrates is notionally a song in both the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>. See in general the comment on O.01.001–010. </p>
