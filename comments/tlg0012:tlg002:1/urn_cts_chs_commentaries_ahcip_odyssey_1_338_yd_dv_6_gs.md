<p>To sing the kind of song that the singer Phemios sings—the song is called <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming, song about of homecoming’ at O.01.326—is described here at O.01.338 as an act of transforming the <em>erga</em> ‘deeds’ of men and gods into the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry. The verb <em>kleiein</em> ‘turn into glory [<em>kleos</em>]’ takes as its direct object the noun <em>erga</em> ‘deeds’. </p>
