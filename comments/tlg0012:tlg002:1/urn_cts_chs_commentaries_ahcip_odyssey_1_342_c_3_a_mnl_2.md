<p>For Penelope, the song that is sung by the singer Phemios, which is supposed to turn the deeds of men and gods into the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry, as we saw at O.01.338, produces the opposite effect here at O.01.342. The song sung by Phemios reminds her of her missing husband Odysseus, making her feel <em>penthos alaston</em> ‘grief unforgettable’, O.01.342. This expression signals lament, which is presented here as antithetical to the kind of <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ that is heard by the audience of Phemios, who are the suitors of Penelope. The personal involvement of Penelope in the song of Odysseus is what makes the kleos that she hears different from the <em>kleos</em> that the suitors hear. For her the <em>kleos</em> contains <em>penthos</em>, while for them it does not. Relevant here is the meaning of the name of Phemios, as analyzed in the comment on O.02.035: in terms of that analysis, Phemios is a singer whose songs mean more than what is meant by that singer. </p>
