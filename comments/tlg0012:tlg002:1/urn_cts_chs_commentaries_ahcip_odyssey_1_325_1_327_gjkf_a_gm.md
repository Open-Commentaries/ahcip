<p>At O.01.325, Phemios is described as the <em>aoidos</em> ‘singer’ who <em>aeidei</em> ‘sings’ epic songs, and the epic song that he sings here is the <em>nostos</em> of the Achaeans, also at O.01.325, where <em>nostos</em> can be translated as not only ‘homecoming’ but also ‘song of homecoming’. Such a song is evidently epic, as we see for example in the title <em>Nostoi</em> ‘Songs of Homecoming’ in the epic Cycle. See under <em>epic</em> and <em>epic Cycle</em> in the inventory of Words and Ideas. See also the comment on O.01.153–155. </p>
