<p>The companions of Odysseus are destroyed because of their own <em>atasthaliai</em> ‘deeds-of-recklessness’. The narrative emphasizes that the companions must own their mistakes. It is essential to note here that the destruction of the companions here is caused not by the Will of Zeus: rather, they are destroyed because they suffer the consequences of doing what they did <em>of their own free will</em>. I add a further note here: I translated the plural of <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ here as ‘deeds-of-recklessness’ in order to convey the fact that a singular noun expressing an abstraction can refer to concrete examples of the abstraction when it is used in the plural. So for example <em>atasthaliā</em> ‘recklessness’ is an abstraction, but here at O.01.007 the plural <em>atasthaliai</em> refers to concrete examples of recklessness—in this case, the recklessness is exemplified by the killing and eating of the Cattle of the Sun. </p>
