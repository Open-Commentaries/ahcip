<p>There is parallelism and overlap between Hermes and Athena (here, Athena is wearing Hermesâ€™ sandals) as in the plotting of the narrative itself; see also the comment on O.01.1 above and the way that Athena takes on the appearance of Hermes in O.13.221-231 (also featuring sandals and a spear). </p>
