<p>It is announced here, at the very beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, that many <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ await Odysseus in this epic, O.01.004. There is a parallel announcement at the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>: many <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ await the Achaeans in that epic, I.01.002. See further the comment on I.01.002. </p>
