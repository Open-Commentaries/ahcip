<p>The text as transmitted by Aristarchus reads:</p><p>πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθὲ καὶ εἴρεο Νέστορα δῖον,</p><p>κεῖθεν δὲ Σπάρτηνδε παρὰ ξανθὸν Μενέλαον·</p><p>ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων.</p><p>‘First you [= Telemachus] go to Pylos and ask radiant Nestor</p><p>and then from there to Sparta and to golden-haired Menelaos,</p><p>the one who was the last of the Achaeans, wearers of bronze tunics, to come back home.’</p><p>But the text as transmitted by Zenodotus reads:</p><p>πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθέ, …</p><p>κεῖθεν δ’ ἐς Κρήτην τε παρ’ Ἰδομενῆα ἄνακτα,</p><p>ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων.</p><p>‘First go to Pylos …</p><p>and then from there to Crete and to king Idomeneus</p><p>who was the last of the Achaeans, wearers of bronze tunics, to come back home.’</p><p>Here at O.01.284–286, as also already at O.01.093, the variant reading that we see transmitted by Zenodotus (quoted in the scholia for O.03.313) indicates a variant epic tradition to which I have already referred as a <em>Cretan Odyssey</em> in my comment on O.01.093. As I argue in Nagy 2015.09.24§§36–37, what we see in these variant verses is a trace of a Cretan Odyssey as primarily represented in our <em>Odyssey</em> by the “Cretan lies,” which are micro-narratives embedded in the epic macro-narrative of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em>. In comments forthcoming, there will be more to say about these “Cretan lies.” Here I confine my comments to points that are relevant to what we read at O.01.093 and O.01.284–286. In “our” <em>Odyssey</em>, as Nestor reports at O.03.191–192, Idomeneus after the Trojan War returns to Crete with all his men safe and sound. In the Cretan Odyssey, by contrast, Idomeneus seems to have traveled with Odysseus after the conquest of Troy by the Achaeans, and this king of the Cretans even experienced, together with Odysseus, the horrors of the Cave of the Cyclops: such a story about joint adventures experienced by Idomeneus and Odysseus is attested in a painting on a red-figure stamnos, 480 BCE, featuring the name-tags ΙΔΑΜΕΝΕΥΣ ‘Ida-meneus’ [sic] and ΟΔΥΣΥΣ ‘Odusus’ [sic] appended to images of these two heroes, showing each one of the two clinging to a ram’s underbelly (Levaniouk 2011:105). </p>
