<p>Athena announces here her plan to visit Telemachus in order to ‘arouse’ him and ‘put spirit in his mind’. These two expressions mean the same thing. When Athena carries out her plan she disguises herself, in Book 1, as Mentes, a foreign trader, and then, in Books 2 and 3, as Mentor, an old man of Ithaca, and both these names mean the same thing, ‘he who arouses, he who stirs up’. The noun <em>menos</em>, ‘spirit’, in Od. 1.89 contains the same verbal root <em>men</em>- as the names <em>Mentēs</em> and <em>Mentōr</em>, and the occurrence of the noun in Athena’s speech anticipates her two disguises. For the meaning of the name <em>Mentōr</em>, particularly in relation to the name <em>Nestōr</em>, see the essay “Nestor’s Name”. As ‘he who stirs up’ the name <em>Mentōr</em> implies an active verb *<em>menō</em>, ‘stir up’, which does not occur in Greek. The active verb with the meaning ‘stir up’ is <em>epotrunō</em>, which is what occurs in Athena’s speech. To make the verbal connection with the names <em>Mentēs</em> and <em>Mentōr</em> the verb <em>epotrunō</em> is glossed in Athena’s speech by the phrase with <em>menos</em>. For more on the verb <em>(ep)otrunō</em> in relation to the name <em>Mentōr</em>, see Frame 2009:25n37.</p>
