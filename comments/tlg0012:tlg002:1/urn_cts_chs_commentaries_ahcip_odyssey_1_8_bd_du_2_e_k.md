<p>The Homeric contexts of <em>nēpios</em>, as the work of Edmunds 1990 | 2016 has shown, point to an etymology involving a combination of the negative prefix *<em>n̥-</em> with the root *<em>Hp-</em> in the sense of ‘connect’, as in Latin <em>in-eptus</em> ‘non-connected’, not with the root *<em>u̯ekw-</em> in the sense of ‘speak’, as in Latin <em>in-fāns </em>‘non-speaking’. What is at stake in the meaning of <em>nēpios</em> is connectivity with parental models and, by extension, with ancestral models. The connectivity may be merely behavioral, as in the case of young animals that survive by staying connected to the older animals that generated them. In the case of humans, the connectivity that begins at infancy is not only behavioral but also mental, extending into adult patterns of consciously following ancestral models of behavior. Further, such connectedness to models may be not only mental but also emotional and even moral. And to be disconnected from such models runs the risk of being doomed for destruction, as we see here at O.01.008 in the case of the companions who followed Odysseus. Their disconnectedness is moral as well as mental. </p>
