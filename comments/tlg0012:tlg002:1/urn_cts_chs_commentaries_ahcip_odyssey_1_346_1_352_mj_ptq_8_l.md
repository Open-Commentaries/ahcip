<p>Telemachus argues with his mother, defending the song that is sung by the singer Phemios about misfortunes experienced by heroes in the course of seeking a successful homecoming. There is a pleasure in the hearing of such a song, Telemachus says at O.01.346–347. Evidently, he does not yet understand the personal involvement of Penelope in the story of such homecoming—or of course his own involvement—because he does not yet understand that the ultimate character in the ultimate story of homecoming will be Odysseus himself. Telemachus speaks positively about the reception of the song of homecoming as sung by the singer Phemios. He says that the audience gives glory to the song, and the verb that is used in his wording is <em>epi-kleiein</em> at O.01.351, which I translate as ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’. I render the <em>epi</em>- of <em>epi-kleiein</em> here as ‘and pass it on’, in the sense that <em>epi</em>- conveys the idea of ‘in addition to, on top of’, supplementing -<em>kleiein</em> in the sense of ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>]’. The wording of Telemachus is justifiable to the extent that the glory of heroes and gods as produced by the singer produces also glory for the song itself as received by the audience. That is to say, this verb <em>epi-kleiein</em> ‘turn [deeds] into glory [<em>kleos</em>] and pass it on’ is reciprocal: there is not only the giving of glory by the audience to the song sung by the singer but there is also the giving of glory by the singer to the song that he sings. Thus it is justifiable for Telemachus to say that the greatest glory goes to the <em>aoidē</em> ‘song‘, O.01.351, that is <em>neōtatē</em> ‘newest’, O.01.352, since the glory to be transmitted must be the latest glory to be received. The reception by the most recent audience must be decisively successful. What Telemachus does not yet understand, however, is that the most recent audience for an ongoing song of homecoming will be not the suitors but the ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>. The audience of the <em>Odyssey</em> will be the definitive audience for the reception of this ongoing song of homecoming. And, for that ultimate audience of the <em>Odyssey</em>, the ultimate hero of the song of homecoming will be Odysseus himself.  </p>
