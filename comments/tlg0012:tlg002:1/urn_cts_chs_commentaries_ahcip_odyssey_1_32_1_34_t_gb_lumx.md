<p>Near the beginning of the <em>Iliad</em>, in contemplating the countless <em>algea</em> ‘pains’, I.01.002, suffered in the Trojan War, the Master Narrator declares that his narration is the Will of Zeus in the process of reaching fulfillment, I.01.005. Near the beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em>, by contrast, Zeus himself declares that mortals are unjustified in saying that the <em>algea</em> ‘pains’ that they suffer, O.01.034, are caused by the gods. The god continues: it is of their own free will, O.01.033–034, that mortals commit <em>atasthaliai</em> ‘deeds of recklessness’, O.01.034, and so their pains are <em>huper</em> <em>moron</em> ‘beyond what is fated’, O.01.034. See already the relevant comments at O.01.007. So, mortals are unjustified in trying to hold the gods legally responsible, as expressed by the verb <em>aitiâsthai</em> ‘hold responsible’, O.01.032.  </p>
