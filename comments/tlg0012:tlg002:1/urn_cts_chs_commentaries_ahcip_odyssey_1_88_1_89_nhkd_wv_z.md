<p>(What follows is epitomized from H24H 9§17.) At a council of the gods, the goddess Athena declares her intention to go to Ithaca to become a mentor to the young hero Telemachus, O.01.088–089. Descending from Olympus and landing in Ithaca, the goddess assumes the human form of a fatherly hero named <em>Méntēs</em>, O.01.105, who proceeds to give wise advice to the young hero. In a subsequent intervention, O.02.268, the goddess will assume the human form of another fatherly hero, named <em>Méntōr</em>, and, as in the present intervention, this other father-substitute will likewise proceed to give wise advice to the young hero. These two names <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em> are both related to the noun <em>menos</em>, which I translate as ‘mental power’. This word, as we can see here at O.01.089, refers to the heroic ‘power’ that the goddess Athena says she will put into Telemachus. The noun <em>menos</em>, usually translated as ‘power’ or ‘strength’, is derived from the verb-root <em>mnē-</em>, meaning ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113). Likewise derived from this verb-root are the agent nouns <em>Méntēs</em> and <em>Méntōr</em>, which both mean ‘he who connects mentally’. When a divinity connects a hero to his heroic mentality, the hero will have <em>menos</em>, that is, ‘power’ or ‘strength’. To have heroic power or strength, you have to have a heroic mentality. See further the comment on O.01.320–322.  </p>
