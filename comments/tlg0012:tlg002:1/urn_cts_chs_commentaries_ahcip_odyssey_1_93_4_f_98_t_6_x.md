<p>The text as transmitted by Aristarchus reads:</p><p>πέμψω δ’ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα</p><p>I [= Athena] will conduct [<em>pempein</em>]him [= Telemachus] on his way to Sparta and to sandy Pylos</p><p>But the text as transmitted by Zenodotus reads:</p><p>πέμψω δ’ ἐς Κρήτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα</p><p>‘I [= Athena] will conduct [<em>pempein</em>] him [= Telemachus] on his way to Crete and to sandy Pylos’</p><p>The variant reading that we see transmitted here by Zenodotus (quoted in the scholia for O.03.313) indicates a variant epic tradition to which I will refer hereafter as a <em>Cretan Odyssey</em>. Further details at O.01.284–286, anchor comment on Cretan Odyssey.  </p>
