<p>Odysseus is the only epic personage to share with Hermes the epithet <em>polutropos</em> (Homeric Hymn 4.13). Similarly, in Homeric Hymn 28.2, the second hymn to Athena , she has the epithet <em>polumÄ“tis</em> &#x27;cunning in many ways&#x27;, which is otherwise restricted to Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em> (I.03.216) and the <em>Odyssey</em> (O.04.763, O.20.168, 22.1).  By no coincidence, these are the two divinities who preside over the return of Odysseus as planned by Athena and Zeus in this narrative. See also <em>Odyssey</em> 1.98 and comments on it below. Note also the only other occurrence of <em>polutropos</em> in Homer (O.10.330), when Kirke figures out who he is because he does not take on the appearance of a pig  and go to the sty when struck by her <em>rhabdos &#x27;staff, wand&#x27;. </em>She<em> </em>explains in the next line (O.10.331) that Hermes (identified only via his epithets, not his name, as though to raise awareness of such terms and who owns them) continually warned her about Odysseus&#x27;s arrival.</p>
