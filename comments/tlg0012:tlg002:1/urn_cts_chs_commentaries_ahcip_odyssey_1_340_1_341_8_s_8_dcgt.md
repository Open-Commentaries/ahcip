<p>At O.01.326–327, we saw <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ functioning as the epithet of the narrative subject of nostos ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’. The narrative subject <em>nostos</em> as ‘song of homecoming’, O.01.326, was followed by the epithet as the first word in the next verse, <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’, O.01.327. So, the epithet was carried over from one verse to the next. Similarly here at O.01.340–341, the word <em>aoidē</em> ‘song’ referring to the song of homecoming, O.01.340, is followed by the epithet <em>lugrē</em> ‘disastrous’ as the first word in the next verse, O.01.341. Once again, the epithet is carried over from one verse to the next. Similarly also at I.01.001–002, the word <em>mēnis</em> referring to the song of the anger of Achilles, I.01.001, is followed by the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ as the first word in the next verse, I.01.002. Yet again, the epithet is carried over from one verse to the next. </p>
