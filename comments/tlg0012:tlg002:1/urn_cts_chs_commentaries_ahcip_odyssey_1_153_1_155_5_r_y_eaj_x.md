<p>The singer of tales here, named Phemios, O.01.154, is ‘singing’ for the suitors as his audience, and the word translated as ‘sing’ here is <em>aeidein</em> at O.01.154 and at O.01.155. Such a singer is not exactly the equivalent of a “court poet,” since Phemios is singing for the suitors against his will, that is, he is singing <em>anankēi</em> ‘by way of constraint’, O.01.154. And what kind of a singer is this Phemios? He sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055. In Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, Phemios is described as a <em>rhapsōidos</em> ‘rhapsode’. The description is accurate in the sense that rhapsodes were professional performers of Homeric poetry in the classical period, as we see clearly in the overall context of Plato’s <em>Ion</em>. But this same description is inaccurate in the sense that rhapsodes in the classical period performed Homeric poetry without accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’: as we see overall in Plato’s <em>Ion</em> and elsewhere, the rhapsodic form of ‘singing’ Homeric poetry was basically <em>recitative</em>, with reduced melody. By contrast, as we read in Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, performers in the classical period who sang with full-blown melody while accompanying themselves on the <em>kitharā</em> ‘lyre’ were called <em>kitharōidoi</em> ‘citharodes’, that is, <em>‘kitharā-singers’</em>. In other words, these ‘lyre-singers’ were performers of what we call <em>lyric</em>. At the festival of the Panathenaia in Athens during the classical period, these lyre-singers or citharodes competed with each other in singing <em>lyric</em>, while rhapsodes competed with each other in singing <em>epic</em>. As we can learn from Plato <em>Ion</em> 533b-c, the prototypical citharode was considered to be Orpheus, while the prototypical rhapsode was Phemios. But Phemios, even though he sings epic and not lyric, is not exactly a rhapsode in the classical sense of the term: as I have already pointed out, Phemios sings while accompanying himself on a kind of lyre, designated by the noun <em>kitharis</em> at O.01.153; also, his playing on the lyre is designated by the verb <em>phormizein</em> at O.01.055. Nevertheless, Plato has a point in considering Phemios a prototypical rhapsode, since what he sings is epic, which is what rhapsodes recite in the classical period—and which is not what citharodes any longer sing. On Phemios as a singer of epic, see the comment on O.01.325–327. </p>
