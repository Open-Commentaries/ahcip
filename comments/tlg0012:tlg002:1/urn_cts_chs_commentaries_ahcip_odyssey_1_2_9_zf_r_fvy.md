<p>We have seen that the epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Odyssey</em> as designated by the driving word <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ in the accusative, <em>andra</em> at O.01.001, used here as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’. Now we see that this epithet <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ at O.01.001 is immediately followed at O.01.001–002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Odyssey</em>: Odysseus veered many times and in many ways before he achieved a safe homecoming for himself. Similarly, we saw that the epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ at I.01.002 describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the <em>Iliad</em> as designated by the driving word <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ in the accusative, <em>mēnin</em> at I.01.001, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. And we saw that this epithet <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ is immediately followed at I.01.002 by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative of the <em>Iliad</em>: the anger of Achilles caused immeasurable suffering. And we will see a further similarity when we consider the epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327, which describes the poetic subject of a performed narration as designated by the driving word <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the accusative, <em>noston</em> at O.01.326, used there as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’. This epithet <em>lugros</em> ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327 is then immediately followed in the same verse by a relative clause that outlines the overall narrative there. See the comment on O.01.326–327.  </p>
