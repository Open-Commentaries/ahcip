<p>Etymologically, the noun <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ indicates a ‘return’ or ‘coming-back’, derived from the verb-root *<em>nes-</em> ‘return, come back’. This root *<em>nes</em>- has a deeper meaning as well: ‘come to’, in the sense of ‘come back to consciousness’; the noun <em>nostos</em> itself, meaning ‘homecoming’, also has a deeper meaning: ‘coming back to light and life’. Etymologically related to the noun <em>nostos</em> in the sense of ‘coming back to light and life’ is the noun <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, which has the deeper meaning of ‘coming to’ in the sense of ‘coming back to consciousness’. Two definitive books on the Greek reflexes of the root *<em>nes- </em>‘return, come back’: Frame 1978 and 2009. As for <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’ in the sense of ‘song of homecoming’, see O.01.326–327. </p>
