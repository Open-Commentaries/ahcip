<p>|320 . . . Into his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] |321 she [= Athena] had placed mental power [<em>menos</em>] and daring, and she had mentally-connected [<em>hupo-mnē‑</em>] him with his father |322 even more than before.</p><p>(Here I epitomize from H24H 9§§18–19.) The idea of <em>menos</em> as ‘mental power’ is elegantly recapitulated here at O.01.320–321. The goddess Athena has just finished the first phase of her role as mentor to Telemachus. She had initiated this phase at O.01.088–089 after having assumed, as we saw at O.01.105, the human shape of the fatherly <em>Méntēs</em>. This name <em>Méntēs</em>, as I indicated in the comment on O.01.088–089, means ‘he who connects mentally’. Having finished with the role of <em>Méntēs</em>, the goddess now transforms herself into a bird and flies out of the palace through a lightwell on the roof, and what we see here at O.01.320–321 is the wording that describes what Athena had accomplished so far in connecting the mind of Telemachus with the mind of his father. In her role as <em>Méntēs</em>, ‘he who connects mentally’, the goddess has given to the hero Telemachus the <em>menos</em> or ‘mental power’ of connecting with the heroic identity of his father. That act of doing this is expressed here at O.01.321 by the verb<em> hupo-mnē-</em>, which means literally ‘mentally connect’ (details in GMP 113). But the mental connectivity of Telemachus is not yet complete, as we will see in the comment on O.01.346–352. </p>
