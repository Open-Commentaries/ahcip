<p>Here we see for the first time the leader of the suitors. His name, <em>Anti-noos</em>, is antithetical to the identity of Odysseus as an exponent of <em>nóos</em> ‘mind’, which stands for that hero’s special way of thinking in the Odyssey. On the <em>nóos</em> of Odysseus, see already the comment on O.01.003. </p>
