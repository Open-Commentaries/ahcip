<p>|1 That man, tell me O Muse the song of that man, the one who-turns-into-many-different-selves [<em>polutropos</em>], who in very many ways |2 veered from his path and wandered off far and wide, after he had destroyed the sacred [<em>hieron</em>] citadel of Troy. |3 Many different cities [<em>astea</em>] of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>nóos</em>]. |4 Many were the pains [<em>algea</em>] he suffered in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] while crossing the sea [<em>pontos</em>], |5 struggling to merit [<em>arnusthai</em>] the saving of his own life [<em>psūkhē</em> ] and his own homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] as well as the homecoming of his companions [<em>hetairoi</em>]. |6 But do what he might he could not save his companions [<em>hetairoi</em>], even though he very much wanted to. |7 For they perished through their own deeds-of-recklessness [<em>atasthaliā</em> plural], |8 disconnected [<em>nēpioi</em>] as they were, because of what they did to the cattle of the sun-god Hēlios. |9 They ate them. So, the god [Hēlios] deprived them of their day of-homecoming [<em>nostimon</em>]. |10 Starting-from-any-single-point-of-departure [<em>hamothen</em>], O goddess, daughter of Zeus, tell-me-as-you-have-told-those-who-came-before-me [<em>eipe kai hēmīn</em>].</p><p>There are three main points to be made in my comments here.</p><p>Point 1.</p><p>The epic of the Homeric <em>Odyssey</em> begins in a way that resembles closely the beginning of its twin, the epic of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>. The main theme of the <em>Odyssey</em> is signaled right away. The signaling is accomplished by way of the first word of the very first verse of the epic. This word is the noun <em>andra</em> ‘man’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>anēr</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>anēr</em> ‘man’ here marks this noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>ennepein</em> ‘narrate, tell’, O.01.001. The Master Narrator is addressing a goddess who is the Muse of the <em>Odyssey</em>, asking the goddess to narrate for him the story of a man who is not yet named as Odysseus. The ‘man’ is the subject of the story. In other words, he is the subject of the narration, or the <em>narrative subject</em>. And this <em>narrative subject</em> is the<em> grammatical object</em> of the verb <em>ennepein</em>, meaning ‘narrate, tell’. Similarly at the beginning of the Homeric <em>Iliad</em>, as analyzed at I.01.001–012, the narrative subject is the first word in the very first verse. That word is the noun <em>mēnin</em> ‘anger’, in the accusative case, which would be <em>mēnis</em> in the nominative. The accusative case of <em>mēnis</em> there marks that noun as the grammatical object of the verb <em>aeidein</em> ‘sing’, I.01.110. There the Master Narrator is addressing a <em>theā</em> ‘goddess’ who is the Muse of the <em>Iliad</em>, asking that goddess to sing for him that anger, I.01.001. The song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. That song is The Song of the Anger, in the sense that the anger <em>is</em> the song. The anger is the narrative subject. Similarly in the <em>Odyssey</em>, the Master Narrator calls on the Muse of the Odyssey to ‘narrate the man’, that is, to ‘tell the song of the man’. Here too the song that will be narrated by the Muse for the Master Narrator will in turn be narrated by the narrator for his listeners. This song is The Song of the Man, in that the man <em>is</em> the song. The man is the narrative subject. And the song captures the total reality of the man. </p><p>Point 2.</p><p>But this reality is not so easy to capture, since the man who is Odysseus is many-sided, as we will now see. Odysseus at O.01.001 is <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’. This translation makes explicit what is only implied in an alternative way of rendering this elusive word, ‘versatile in many ways’ (H24H 0§21, also 9§4, also 10§2), where the Latin root <em>vert</em>- ‘turn’ of the Latinate word <em>versatile</em> can mean not only ‘turn around’ but also ‘turn into a different self’, as we see most clearly in the Latin word for ‘werewolf’, <em>versi</em>-<em>pellis</em>, which literally means ‘he whose skin has turned’ (Pliny <em>Natural History</em> 8.34; Petronius 62; details in GMP 264–265). Similarly, <em>polutropos</em> applies to <em>a figure who is different at every turn</em>, and who becomes different many times and in many ways. That is why the ultimate shape-shifter, the god Hermes, is <em>polutropos</em> in the <em>Homeric Hymn to Hermes</em> (verses 13, 439). And that is why, in the only other context where Odysseus is described as <em>polutropos</em>, O.10.330, he is associated in that context with his polytropic model, Hermes himself, O.10.331–332. (Further commentary in GMP 34.) Since Odysseus can turn into something different at every turn, the multiplicity of angles to be seen at every turn helps explain why this hero will not yet be named at the beginning of the Odyssey. </p><p>Point 3.</p><p>There is still more to be said about this adjective <em>polutropos</em> ‘turning-into-many-different-selves’ describing Odysseus at O.01.001: it is used here as an <em>epithet for the narrative subject</em>, which in this case is <em>anēr</em> ‘man’. Another such epithet is the adjective <em>oulomenē</em> ‘disastrous’ describing the <em>mēnis</em> ‘anger’ of Achilles at I.01.002. </p>
