<p>The noun <em>thūmos</em>, which I translate here as ‘heart’, expresses in Homeric diction the human capacity to feel and to think, taken together. In some Homeric contexts, <em>thūmos</em> is used as a synonym of <em>phrenes</em>, which can also be translated as ‘heart’, as in my comment on O.01.089. In other Homeric contexts, on the other hand, <em>thūmos</em> is pictured as the vital force that is contained by the <em>phrenes</em> (details in GMP 113n111). Even in such contexts, both words can be approximated as ‘heart’. In other still contexts, <em>phrenes</em> is best translated as ‘thinking’.  Such a meaning is not contradictory, since Homeric diction leaves room for the idea that you can think with your heart. </p>
