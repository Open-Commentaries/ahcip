<p>|88 αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν Ἰθάκηνδε ἐλεύσομαι, ὄφρα οἱ υἱὸν |89 μᾶλλον ἐποτρύνω καί οἱ μένος ἐν φρεσὶ θείω, |90 εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσαντα κάρη κομόωντας Ἀχαιοὺς |91 πᾶσι μνηστήρεσσιν ἀπειπέμεν, οἵ τέ οἱ αἰεὶ |92 μῆλ’ ἁδινὰ σφάζουσι καὶ εἰλίποδας ἕλικας βοῦς. |93 πέμψω δ’ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα |94 νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσῃ, |95 ἠδ’ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν.</p><p>|88 As for me, I will go travel to Ithaca, going to his [= Odysseus’] son |89 in order to give him [= Telemachus] more encouragement and to put mental power [<em>menos</em>] into his heart [<em>phrenes</em>]. |90 He is to summon the long-haired Achaeans for a meeting in assembly, |91 and he is to speak out to all the suitors [of his mother Penelope], who persist in |92 slaughtering again and again any number of his sheep and oxen. |93 And I will conduct [<em>pempein</em>] him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos, |94 and thus he will learn [<em>punthanesthai</em>] the return [<em>nostos</em>] of his dear [<em>philos</em>] father, if by chance he [= Telemachus] hears [<em>akouein</em>] it, |95 and thus may genuine glory [<em>kleos</em>] possess him throughout humankind.</p><p>Here the <em>nostos</em> of Odysseus, O.01.094, is shown to be not only a ‘homecoming’ but also a ‘song of homecoming’. On the meaning ‘song of homecoming’, see the comment on O.01.326–327. On <em>kleos</em> in the sense of an overall reference to the ‘glory’ of poetry, see the comment on I.02.325. Here at O.01.088–095, we can see that <em>nostos</em> as a ‘song of homecoming’ is a prerequisite for the quest of Odysseus to achieve the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry. Odysseus will receive the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of his own <em>Odyssey</em> only if he achieves a successful <em>nostos</em> ‘homecoming’, and it is the <em>kleos</em> ‘glory’ of poetry that turns his <em>homecoming</em> into a <em>song of homecoming</em>. What the goddess says at O.01.094 is not that Telemachus will learn <em>about</em> the <em>nostos</em> of Odysseus if he is fortunate enough to hear <em>about</em> it. In the original Greek text, the noun <em>nostos</em> is the direct object of both the verb <em>punthanesthai</em>, ‘learn’ and the verb <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’ at O.01.094 here, and that is why I chose to translate the verse this way: ‘and thus he will learn [<em>punthanesthai</em>] the return [<em>nostos</em>] of his dear [<em>philos</em>] father, if by chance he [= Telemachus] hears [<em>akouein</em>] it’. Elsewhere too in the <em>Odyssey</em>, we see nostos as the direct object of <em>punthanesthai</em> ‘learn’: O.02.215, O.02.264, O.02.360, O.04.714—as also of <em>akouein</em> ‘hear’: O.01.287, O.02.218, O.02.360. It is not a question of learning <em>about</em> a homecoming, of hearing <em>about</em> a homecoming. Rather, Telemachus will learn the actual song of the homecoming, the song of <em>nostos</em>, by hearing it. He will actually hear the song from the hero Nestor in <em>Odyssey</em> 3 and from the hero Menelaos along with his divine consort Helen in <em>Odyssey</em> 4.
