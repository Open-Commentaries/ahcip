<p>The words used here in telling about the ordeals of Hēraklēs match closely the words used at the very beginning of the <em>Odyssey</em> to tell about the ordeals of Odysseus:</p><p>|1 That man, tell me O Muse the song of that man, that versatile [<em>polu-tropos</em>] man, who in very many ways |2 veered from his path and wandered off far and wide, after he had destroyed the sacred citadel of Troy. |3 Many different cities of many different people did he see, getting to know different ways of thinking [<em>noos</em>]. |4 Many were the pains [<em>algea</em>] he suffered in his heart [<em>thūmos</em>] while crossing the sea |5 struggling to merit [<em>arnusthai</em>] the saving of his own life [<em>psūkhē</em>] and his own homecoming [<em>nostos</em>] as well as the homecoming of his comrades [<em>hetairoi</em>]. </p><p><em>Odyssey</em> 1.1-5</p><p>|1 ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, Μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ |2 πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσε· |3 πολλῶν δ’ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω, |4 πολλὰ δ’ ὅ γ’ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν, |5 ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.</p>
