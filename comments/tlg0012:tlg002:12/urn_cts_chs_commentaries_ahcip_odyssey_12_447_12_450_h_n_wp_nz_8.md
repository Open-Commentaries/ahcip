<p>(The following is epitomized from H24H 10§28.) At O.07.241–266, Odysseus told the story of his liaison with the goddess Calypso, and that part of the story ended there with the releasing of Odysseus from the cave of the goddess. Here at O.12.447–450, the storytelling comes full circle as Odysseus revisits that story about the liaison, which had led into the story of his arrival in the land of the Phaeacians. The hero’s arrival as revisited at the end of the storytelling in <em>Odyssey</em> 12 is implicitly a return to light and life from the cave of Calypso, comparable to the return of the hero to light and life from the darkness and death that were linked with the cave of the Cyclops Polyphemus at the end of the storytelling in <em>Odyssey</em> 9. Similarly at the end of the storytelling in <em>Odyssey</em> 11, Odysseus was ready to emerge from the darkness and death of Hādēs and return to light and life at the beginning of <em>Odyssey</em> 12.  </p>
