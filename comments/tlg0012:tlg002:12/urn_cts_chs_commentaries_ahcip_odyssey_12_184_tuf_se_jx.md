<p>The translations ‘of many fables’ or more simply ‘fabled’ reflect the specialized meaning of <em>ainos</em> as ‘fable’. In addressing Odysseus this way, the Sirens are recognizing the hero’s fame as a master of <em>ainos</em>, which is a form of speech that can more generally be described as a <em>coded message</em> (on which see the comment on I.09.524–599). So, Odysseus is recognized as ‘able to speak about many things <em>in code</em>’. Such coded speech is by nature ‘riddling’, as we see from the meaning of <em>ainigma</em> ‘enigma, riddle’, which is a derivative of <em>ainos</em>. In order to survive, Odysseus must master many different forms of discourse, many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>. That is why he is addressed as <em>poluainos</em> ‘having many different kinds of <em>ainos</em>’ by the Sirens here when he sails past their island, O.12.184. (What follows is epitomized from H24H 10§43.) Even the transparent meaning of Polyphemus, <em>Poluphēmos</em>, which is the name of the Cyclops blinded by Odysseus, foretells the hero’s mastery of the <em>ainos</em>. As an adjective, <em>poluphēmos</em> means ‘having many different kinds of things said’, derived from the noun <em>phēmē</em>, ‘thing said’, as at O.20.100 and at O.20.105. See the comment at O.20.098-121, [HR]3§23. This adjective <em>poluphēmos</em> ‘having many different kinds of things said’ is applied as an epithet to the singer <em>Phēmios</em>, O.22.376, portrayed as singing songs that have many different meanings: see the comments at O.01.342 and O.02.035 (see also BA 17). In the case of Polyphemus, the very meaning of his name, which conveys the opposite of the meaning conveyed by the false name of Odysseus, <em>Outis</em>, ‘no one’, foretells the verbal mastery of the hero who blinded the monster.  </p>
