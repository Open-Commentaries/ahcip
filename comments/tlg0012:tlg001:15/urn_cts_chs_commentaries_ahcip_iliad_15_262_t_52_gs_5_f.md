<p>As foretold at I.15.059–060, the god Apollo is engaged here in the act of <em>en-pneîn</em> ‘breathing into’ the hero Hector something called <em>menos</em> ‘mental power’, I.15.262. To be compared is the intervention of the goddess Athena, earlier at I.10.482. Now too, at I.15.262, such ‘mental power’ makes the hero aware of his physical power and thus energizes him to perform heroic deeds.  </p>
