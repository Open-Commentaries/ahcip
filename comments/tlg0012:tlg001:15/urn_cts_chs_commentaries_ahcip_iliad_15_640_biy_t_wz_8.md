<p>We can understand <em>bíē '</em>force, violence' as a key to the <em>kléos</em> 'glory' of Achilles/Odysseus in the <em>Iliad</em>/<em>Odyssey</em>, as well to the <em>kléos </em>of other heroes in the epic tradition. In the case of Herakles, for example, the theme of <em>bíē</em> is actually embodied in the hero's identity, since he is conventionally named not only as <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> but also as <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em>, as here (βίῃ Ἡρακληείῃ). The fact that a full declension of this periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs </em>is attested in the diction of archaic hexameter poetry is itself striking evidence, on the level of form, that the Herakles figure and <em>bíē</em> are traditionally linked on the level of theme. Since the very name <em>Hēra</em>-<em>kléēs</em> 'he who has the <em>kléos</em> of Hera' embodies the them of glory <em>through epic</em>, the tradition combination of <em>bíē</em><em> </em>with <em>kléos</em> in the periphrastic naming construct <em>bíē</em> + adjective of <em>Hērakléēs</em> is a formal indication that <em>bíē</em> is a traditional epic theme. The heroic resource of <em>bíē</em>, then, has a distinctly positive aspect as a key to the hero's <em>kléos</em>. Nevertheless, it has a disquieting negative aspect as well, as in the case of the <em>Odyssey</em>, where Odysseus uses <em>bíē</em><em> </em>to kill the suitors and the overall behavior of the suitors themselves is also characterized as <em>bíē </em>(e.g., O.23.031). </p><p>See also I.02.658, I.02.666, I.04.386, I.05.638, I.11.690, and I.19.098.</p>
