<p>As the divine artisan or craftsman, the god Hephaistos is conventionally called a <em>khalkeus</em> ‘bronze-smith’, as here. It will become clear from later contexts, like I.18.474–475, that this appelation of the god does not restrict him to work in bronze: he works in other metals as well. See the comment on I.18.468–613.  </p>
