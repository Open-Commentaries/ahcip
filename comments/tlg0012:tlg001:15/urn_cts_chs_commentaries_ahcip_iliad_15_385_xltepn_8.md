<p>References to the topography of the Troad in the <em>Iliad</em> reveal a remarkable consistency and precision in visualizing that topography. But there is more to it than consistency and precision. These references are also external indications of an internal reality, and that reality is the formulaic system of Homeric poetry—a system that organizes the external reality of what is pictured by that poetry. The <em>Iliad</em> situates the <em>naustathmon</em>, imagined as the 'harbor of the Achaeans', in the Trojan Bay of the Hellespont. (We see an explicit reference to this bay at I.14.036.) According to the <em>Iliad</em>, the ships of the Achaeans are beached along the coastline of this bay, with their sterns pointing inward, contiguous with the Achaean Wall, and with their prows pointing outward in the direction of the water. So the <em>naustathmon</em> is not to be imagined as a harbor in the modern sense of the word: according to the <em>Iliad</em>, the ships of the Achaeans were neither anchored offshore in a harbor nor docked in a harbor. </p><p>See also the comment at I.14.027–036.</p>
