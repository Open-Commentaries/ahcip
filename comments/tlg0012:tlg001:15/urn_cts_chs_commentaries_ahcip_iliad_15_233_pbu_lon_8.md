<p>The Hellespont is a focal point for the heroic essence of Achilles: Homeric poetry presents his tomb as overlooking its dangerous waters, the setting for violent storms expressed by the same imagery that expresses the hero's cosmos affinity with fire and wind. Moreover, epic diction presents this fire and wind as primarily endangering the ships of the Achaeans, which are conventionally described as being beached along the shores of the bay of the Hellespont (as here, I.17.432, I.18.150, and I.22.002). In other words, the Hellespont is also a focal point for the heroic essence of all the Achaeans who came to fight at Troy. </p><p>From the standpoint of a Homeric audience in the eighth or seventh centuries B.C., the site of the Trojan War is significant not so much because of Troy itself but because of the Hellespont, passage to the Black Sea. And the prime affinity of Achilles with the Hellespont and the realms to which it leads will survive for centuries, well beyond the classical period. From inscriptions found in the Black Sea area, we know that Achilles still presides over the <em>póntos</em> even as late as the second/third centuries A.D.: he is in fact still worshipped as the <em>Pontárhkēs</em> 'Ruler of the <em>Póntos</em>'. </p><p>See especially the comment on I.08.220–227.</p>
