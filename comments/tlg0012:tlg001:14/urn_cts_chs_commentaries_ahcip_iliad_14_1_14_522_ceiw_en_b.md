<p>The momentum of the attacking Trojan warriors gets stalled here, since Hērā interrupts the ongoing Plan of Zeus. The goddess seduces the god, and the setting for their divine sexual encounter is the spectacular landscape of Mount Ida, which is the private abode of the thundering almighty. During the tryst of the god and the goddess, the Achaeans regain the upper hand in the fighting. But this new momentum is soon headed for a downturn. The divine interruption, despite all its cosmic sexual energy, becomes retrospectively a mere interlude in the narrative arc of the <em>Iliad</em>—once the tryst is over and the Plan of Zeus resumes its relentless course of action. </p><p></p><span><img src="https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Carracci_-_Jupiter_et_Junon.jpeg" alt="draft js image error"/></span><p>Juno and Jupiter.
