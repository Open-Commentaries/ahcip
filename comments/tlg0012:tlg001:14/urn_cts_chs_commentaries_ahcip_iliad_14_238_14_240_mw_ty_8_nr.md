<p>The goddess Hērā promises to commission the making of a beautiful <em>thronos</em> ‘throne’, I.14.238. The maker will be the divine artisan Hephaistos, son of Hērā, I.14.239–240. This throne made by the god will be <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’, and this imperishability will last <em>aiei</em> ‘forever’, I.14.238. Also, this throne will be <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’, I.14.239. (On the combination of <em>aphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ and <em>khrūseo</em>- ‘golden’ in symbolizing the artificial continuum of immortality, see BA 179.) The Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthito</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adverb <em>aieí</em> ‘always’ here is comparable to the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the adjective <em>viśvā́yur</em> ‘lasting for all ages’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7: the form viśvā́yur is the neuter of <em>viśvā́yus</em>-, agreeing with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’. (Full argumentation in GMP 123–126 for interpreting <em>viśvā́yur</em> as a neuter and not masculine adjective in this context: it goes with <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ and not, as some have argued, with the name of the god Indra.) The element <em>ā́yus-</em> in this Indic form is cognate with Greek <em>aiṓn</em> ‘life-force, lifetime’, the original locative singular of which became the adverb <em>aieí</em>, meaning ‘forever’. See the note on I.01.052. The formulaic combination <em>áphthiton aieí</em> is attested elsewhere as well in Homeric diction, at I.02.046 and at I.02.186. And there is even an instance of the combination <em>kléos áphthiton aieí</em> ‘a glory that is imperishable forever’ in an archaic piece of poetry inscribed in the seventh century BCE: κλεFος απθιτον αιFει, DGE no. 316. This combination brings us back to the wording κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται = <em>kléos áphthiton éstai</em> ‘there will be an imperishable glory’ at I.09.413. To be noted again is the parallelism between the Greek combination of the adjective <em>áphthiton</em> ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>kléos</em> ‘glory, fame’ at I.09.413 and the Indic combination of the adjective <em>ákṣita</em>- ‘imperishable’ with the noun <em>śrávas</em> ‘glory, fame’ at <em>Rig-Veda</em> 1.9.7 (full argumentation in GMP 123–126).  </p>
