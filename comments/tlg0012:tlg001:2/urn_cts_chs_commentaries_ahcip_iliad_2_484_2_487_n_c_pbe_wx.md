<p>The immediacy of the Master Narrator’s performance here is counterbalanced by an attitude of remoteness from the composition. Such a counterbalance indicates the Narrator’s deference to the epic tradition of Homeric poetry. The Narrator does not claim that he <em>knows</em> the tradition: instead, he says he just ‘hears’ it from the Muses, and this act of ‘hearing’ is <em>kleos</em>, derived from the verb <em>kluein</em> ‘hear’. The literal meaning of <em>kleos</em> as ‘the thing heard’ has an enormous prestige that translates into the idealized meaning of  ‘glory, fame’ as applied to the composition and performance of Homeric poetry. The Narrator of Homeric poetry is proud of his capacity to ‘hear’. To hear what? To hear ‘the thing heard’, which is <em>kleos</em>. This capacity translates into ‘glory, fame’ not only for Homeric poetry but also for the poet who performs the poetry. Such a poet claims access to both the form and the content of what he ‘hears’ the Muses tell him. </p>
