<p>Here the words of blame uttered by Thersites insult Achilles, calling into question the motives of that hero. It is as if the anger of Achilles were not real. This kind of misrepresentation by way of blame poetry is described as <em>ekhthrā parphasis</em> ‘invidious side-wording’ in Pindar <em>Nemean</em> 8.32.  </p>
