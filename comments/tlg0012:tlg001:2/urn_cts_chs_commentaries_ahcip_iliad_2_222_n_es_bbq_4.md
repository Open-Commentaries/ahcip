<p>Besides the noun <em>neikos</em> (plural <em>neikea</em>) ‘quarrel’ and the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’, on both which see the comment on I.02.221, another set of words referring to the poetics of blame as antithetical to the poetics of praise in general and of epic in particular is the noun <em>oneidos</em> (plural <em>oneidea</em>), as here, meaning ‘words of insult’, and the verb <em>oneidein</em>, meaning ‘say words of insult’, as elsewhere.  </p>
