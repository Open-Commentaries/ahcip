<p>The petrified serpent is equated with the story of Troy, and the word <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ here conveys the inevitable outcome of that story. The prophecy expressed by <em>teleîn</em> reveals a poetics of unchangeability in narrating the story. And the concretization of such unchangeability is visualized as the petrifaction of the serpent. The imperfective aspect of the verb <em>teleîn</em> ‘reach an outcome’ here is referring to the story of Troy as it is still being told, as it is still in progress.  </p>
