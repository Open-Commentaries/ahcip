<p>The expression <em>kleos oupot’ oleitai</em> ‘its glory [<em>kleos</em>] will never perish’ (κλέος οὔποτ’ ὀλεῖται), as here at I.02.325, is parallel with <em>kleos aphthiton estai</em> (κλέος ἄφθιτον ἔσται) at I.09.413, which can be translated ‘the glory [<em>kleos</em>] will be imperishable [<em>aphthiton</em>]’. This parallelism shows that <em>aphthito</em>- at I.09.413 and elsewhere was understood to be not just long-lasting, as some have thought, but eternal. As for the interpretation ‘the glory [<em>kleos</em>] will be imperishable [<em>aphthiton</em>]’, we will see in the comment on I.09.413 that an alternative interpretation is also possible: ‘and there will be a glory [<em>kleos</em>] that is imperishable’.  </p>
