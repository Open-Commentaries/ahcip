<p>When Agamemnon wakes up from dreaming the False Dream, he experiences the sensation of an <em>omphē</em> ‘oracular voice’ that has just now been poured all over him. This idea of <em>omphē</em> as an ‘oracular voice’ (the word is cognate with English <em>song</em>) is picked up by the word <em>ossa</em> ‘oracular voice’ at I.02.093, which refers there to the personified False Dream who had announced himself as the <em>Dios angelos</em> ‘messenger’ of Zeus to the sleeping Agamemnon at I.02.026. In the context of Theognis 1.808 and elsewhere, <em>omphē</em> refers to the oracular voice of the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi. Such contexts show that <em>omphē</em> in the sense of ‘oracular voice’ is relevant to the misunderstanding experienced by Agamemnon in <em>Iliad</em> 2. Just as Agamemnon misunderstands the oracular voice that is mediated by the False Dream, so also he misunderstands the oracular voice of the god Apollo himself in the First Song of Demodokos O.08.072–083. At verses 77–78 of that “micro-Iliad,” it is said that Agamemnon was happy to see Odysseus and Achilles quarelling; at verses 79–83, it is said that such a quarrel was predicted by the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi to Agamemnon when this over-king went there for an oracular consultation. And at verses 81–82 it is said that this quarrel was really a sign that foretold a great <em>pēma</em> ‘pain’ that was about to befall the Achaeans as well as the Trojans in the Trojan War.  </p>
