<p>Here in the <em>Iliad</em>, the <em>telos</em> or ‘fulfillment’ of the plot is being realized only in the form of a prophecy—by contrast with the epic Cycle, where the conquest of Troy is the ultimate <em>telos</em>. There are comparable themes in Virgil <em>Aeneid</em> 8.615-629, 729-731, featuring the Shield of Aeneas. </p>
