<p>This is the second occurrence of the noun <em>therapōn</em> in the <em>Iliad</em>; the plural form here is <em>therapontes</em>. The surface meaning of <em>therapōn</em> in Homeric diction is ‘attendant’, and a fitting example is the word’s first occurrence in the <em>Iliad</em>, at I.01.321; the deeper meaning, however, is ‘ritual substitute’. In contexts where the plural <em>therapontes</em> in combination with <em>Arēos</em> ‘of Ares’ is applied to the Achaeans=Danaans=Argives (at I.02.110, to the Danaoi) as a grouping of warriors, the deeper meaning is more evident than in other contexts. When a warrior is killed in war, he becomes a <em>therapōn</em> or ‘ritual substitute’ who dies for Ares by becoming identical to the war god at the moment of death; then, after death, the warrior is eligible to become a cult hero who serves as a sacralized ‘attendant’ of the war god in contexts of hero cult.</p>
