<p> The False Dream, personified, describes himself here as the <em>Dios angelos</em> ‘messenger of Zeus’. Later on, at I.02.063, Agamemnon himself describes the personified False Dream as the <em>Dios angelos</em> ‘messenger of Zeus’. Still later on, at I.02.93, the False Dream will be equated with <em>Ossa</em>, personification of an <em>ossa</em> ‘oracular voice’. And this personified <em>Ossa</em> is then described at I.02.94 as <em>Dios angelos</em> ‘messenger of Zeus’.</p>
