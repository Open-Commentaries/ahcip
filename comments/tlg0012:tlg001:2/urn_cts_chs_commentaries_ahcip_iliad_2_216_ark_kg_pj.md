<p>The programmatic representation of Thersites as an exponent of blame poetry is summed up in the description of this character as <em>aiskhistos</em> ‘most disgraceful’. In the <em>Poetics</em> of Aristotle (1449a), the semantics of the underlying (a) noun <em>aiskhos</em> ‘disgrace, shame’ and (b) adjective <em>aiskhron</em> ‘disgraceful, shameful’ can be seen as the basic context of blame poetry. </p>
