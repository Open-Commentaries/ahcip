<p>The ships of Odysseus here are described by way of the epithet <em>milto-parēioi</em> ‘with cheeks of red’; at O.09.125, the same epithet describes generic ships. To be contrasted is another epithet for ships, <em>phoinīko-parēioi</em> ‘with cheeks of purple’, applied to generic ships at O.11.124 and O.23.271. Inventories of chariots in the Linear B tablets of Knossos show a parallel dichotomy of red and purple in descriptions of colors painted on chariots: the noun i-qi-ja ‘chariot’ is described as either mi-to-we-sa = <em>miltówessa</em> ‘red’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4407 or po-ni-ki-ja = <em>phoinikíā</em> ‘purple’ as in Knossos tablet Sd 4402.</p>
