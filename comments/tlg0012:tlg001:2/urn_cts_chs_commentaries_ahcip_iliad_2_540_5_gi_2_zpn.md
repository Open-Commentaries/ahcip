<p>Here is the first Iliadic occurrence of the epithet <em>ozos Arēos</em>, which can be translated generally as ‘attendant of Ares’. The application of this epithet to a hero indicates that such a hero, as a warrior, is destined to become a ritual substitute for the war-god Ares. See the anchor comment at I.12.188.  </p>
