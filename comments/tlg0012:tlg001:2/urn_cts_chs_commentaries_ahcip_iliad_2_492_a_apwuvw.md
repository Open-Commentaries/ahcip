<p>What the Muses do is ‘put the mind in touch’: this translation of <em>mimnēskein</em> is more accurate than ‘remind’, since the idea of ‘reminding’ in a language like English restricts the idea of mental contact to the past. But the idea conveyed by the word <em>mimnēskein</em> is broader. This Greek word refers to mental contact not only with the past but also with the present and even with the future. The Muses have the power to put the mind in touch with times and places other than one’s own. </p>
