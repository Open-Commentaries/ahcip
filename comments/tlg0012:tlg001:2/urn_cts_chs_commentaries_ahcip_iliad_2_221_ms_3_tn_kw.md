<p>As an exponent of blame poetry, which is antithetical to the poetry of epic as a vehicle for praising what is good about heroes, Thersites is truly <em>ekhthistos</em> ‘most hateful’ to the primary two heroes of epic poetry as represented by the Homeric <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>, who are of course Achilles and Odysseus respectively. As we read at I.02.220–221, Thersites has his quarrels especially with these two heroes, and the verb <em>neikeîn</em> ‘quarrel with’ as used here at I.02.221, together with the corresponding noun <em>neikos</em> ‘quarrel’ as used elsewhere, refers programmatically to the poetics of blame.  </p>
