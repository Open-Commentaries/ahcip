<p>We see here a transition from the <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium, prelude’ that introduces the Catalogue of Ships to the actual narration of the Catalogue. The transition is formalized by way of picking up a basic idea from the <em>prooimion</em>. This idea, signaled by the word <em>hēgemones</em> ‘leaders’ at I.02.487 in the <em>prooimion</em>, is now picked up by the word <em>arkhoi</em> ‘leaders’ here in the first verse of the actual narration, I.02.493. For the etymology of <em>prooimion</em> ‘proemium, prelude’, see the comment on O.08.074. </p>
