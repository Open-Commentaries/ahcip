<p>The Master Narrator addresses here a singular Muse: see the comment on I.02.761. The Muse is asked for an answer to the Iliadic question: who is the ‘best of the Achaeans’? The answer of the Muse is that Achilles is the best—and that Ajax is the second-best within the framework of the <em>Iliad</em>. The formulation of the Muse’s answer is an exquisite exercise in ring-composition.  </p>
