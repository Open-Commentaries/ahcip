<p>The word <em>kolōnē</em> ‘tumulus’ here at I.02.811 refers to the place where, as we read further at I.02.814, the <em>sēma</em> ‘tomb’ of an otherworldly femaie named Murinē is located; she is pictured here as <em>polu-skarthmos</em> ‘taking many leaps and bounds’. We may compare the word <em>kolōnē</em> ‘tumulus’ here to the word <em>kolōnos</em> ‘tumulus’ referring to the tomb of Protesilaos in Philostratus <em>On heroes</em> 9.1, where this same tomb is also called a <em>sēma</em> at 9.3, and to the tomb of Achilles in <em>On heroes</em> 51.12, where that same tomb is also called a <em>sēma</em> at 53.11 (also at 51.2, 52.3). The naming of the location known as ‘the <em>sēma</em> of Murinē who takes many leaps and bounds’ is said at I.02.814 to originate from the language of the immortal gods, whereas the same location is said at I.02.813 to be called Batieia in the language of mortal men.  </p>
