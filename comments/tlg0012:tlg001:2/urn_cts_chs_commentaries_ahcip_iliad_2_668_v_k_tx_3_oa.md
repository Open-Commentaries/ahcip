<p>The tripartition of the whole island of Rhodes <em>kata-phūladon</em> ‘by way of subdivision’ is comparable to the traditional tripartition of many Dorian cities into three <em>phūlai</em> ‘subdivisions’. In Dorian societies comprised of three <em>phūlai</em>, kings are conventionally chosen from the second <em>phūlē</em>. Similarly in Indic traditions, kings are conventionally chosen from the second <em>varṇa</em>- or ‘subdivision’ of society.  </p>
