Iliad 15Translated by Douglas Frame[401] Have your attendant [therapôn] entertain you. I[402] must hurry back to Achilles to stir him up to go to war.[403] Who knows whether with a god's [daimon] help I may stir his heart [thumos][404] when I try to persuade him; a comrade's persuasion is a good [agathos] thing. [=I-11.793]
