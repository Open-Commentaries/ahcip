This simile contains the one instance of the adjective *alēthēs* in Homeric epic that is not applied directly to verbal communication, but to a person, a woman weighing wool with scales. The other instances of *alēthēs* show that it qualifies (the content of) speech, indicating that it denotes truthfulness in the sense of not forgetting what has been said in an uninterrupted continuum of time, and not letting anything slip by one without being mindful of its implications (and indeed, *a-lēthēs *and *a-lētheia *are to be understood in opposition to *lēthē*). Here, however, it can be seen to be applied by a logical extension to the agent of such communication, and so, to indicate the woman’s scrupulousness in her business transactions (so Cole).

Insofar as the simile and the wool-weighing woman illustrates the balance of the battle between the Greeks and the Trojans, there is a further dimension to her being *alēthēs*. The balance of and then the change in a battle is often represented through the image of Zeus weighing the two sides in scales (e.g. I.8.69-74, I.16.658, I.19.223-224, I.22.209-213), and this image of Zeus can be seen to be implied here, too, even if it is not explicitly presented as such: in lines 437-438 Zeus gives the upper hand to Hektor. Detienne argues that this image reflects the idea of the archaic king pronouncing justice, with which scales are likewise associated: such pronouncements of justice by the king are just and *alēthēs*. The model for this king is Zeus in his role of administering justice and judging between two sides, using his scales – and so the adjective is appropriate here, too, signaling the divine justness and *alētheia* of the judgement weighed in the scales. The application of the adjective *alēthēs *explicitly to the woman within the simile, then, presents her in the role of Zeus as a divine judge, transferring to the vehicle an attribute of the tenor. And the idea of *pronouncing* such judgements brings *alēthēs* here, too, back to the sphere of communication that excludes forgetting, ignoring, and failing to notice by its opposition to *lēthē*.

Telemakhos appeals to the principle of reciprocity in his address to the Ithacans: his speech shows that feasting, such as the suitors are undertaking at Odysseus’ house, is a matter that calls for reciprocation (when correctly conducted; O.2.74-78). Conversely, an evil turn should likewise be reciprocated by an evil turn, another aspect of reciprocity that Telemakhos’ words make clear, and which their chiastic arrangement further underscores (δυσμενέων κάκ’ ἔρεξεν … κακὰ ῥέζετε δυσμενέοντες ‘[if Odysseus,] bearing ill-will, did evil deeds … you are doing evil deeds, bearing ill-will,’ O.2.72-73). The Ithacans’ not stopping the suitors would in Telemakhos’ words be explicable as a return for an earlier bad turn by Odysseus, but if that is not the case, they deserve as punishment the *mēnis* of gods (O.2.66-67).

As for what *mēnis* is, let us take a step back and look at some elements in Telemakhos’s speech: he describes the wrongs of the suitors (O.2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – *mēnis *of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (O.2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (O.2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, *mēnis* is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of *mēnis* and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order. (Compare the speech of Mentor at O.2.229-241, in my note on which I discuss *mēnis* and memory, which works towards the same end as *mēnis* but in a symmetrically opposite manner, and the ethical function of the two further. With regard to reciprocity, Mentor, in contrast to what Telemakhos says here, is clear on the point that there has been no earlier bad turn by Odysseus that would justify the current outrage in Ithaca, and so, the people deserve a punishment as a reciprocation for their actions).

To return to reciprocity: just as *mēnis* has a moral dimension and a function in upholding the proper social and cosmic order, so, too, is reciprocity involved in morality. Reciprocal exchange is a total social phenomenon in the Maussian sense of the term, such that reciprocal exchange is also an articulation of the social order, of the cosmic hierarchy, and an instance of the working of *themis* (the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior) – it is worth noting here that Telemakhos appeals to Themis in his speech (O.2.68). *mēnis* in fact protects the rules of exchange and the hierarchy of proper cosmic order, and reciprocity and *mēnis* are thus interconnected. Telemakhos’ speech neatly illustrates this web of interconnected concepts, and his argument relies on understanding their role within the Homeric society.

The wording of Mentor’s address to the assembly demonstrates the ethical dimension of the archaic Greek concept of memory: the failure of the people of Ithaca to respect Odysseus and behave appropriately towards him and his household is attributed to their not remembering him. Conversely, the speech also indicates that such forgetful subjects deserve harsh rulers (O.2.230-234): memory is the principle that maintains good social interactions and proper social order, and its absence brings about the opposite. Mentor’s name, ‘he who reminds,’ ‘he who stirs up’, is not inappropriate to the context, either.

Comparing Mentor’s speech with that of Telemakhos earlier in the assembly (O.2.45-69; some of what I discuss here is also included in my comment on O.2.63-79), we see further dimensions of memory as the principle that maintains proper social order. Telemakhos in his speech describes the wrongs of the suitors (O.2.63-64), presents a principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs – in his speech, it is *mēnis *of gods as the punishment for the outrageous situation in Ithaca (O.2.66-67) – and extends the blame from the culprits proper to their solidarity group (O.2.64-66). As Muellner argues with regards to Telemakhos’ speech, *mēnis* is a sanction aimed at maintaining the cosmic order and incurring it implies the transgression of fundamental cosmic rules, such as the ones the suitors break in abusing the hospitality of Odysseus’ household. Furthermore, given the role of solidarity in maintaining the continuity of the world order, those in the solidarity group of a transgressor are liable for punishment along with the culprit. Thus the three elements singled out from Telemakhos’ speech conform to the concept of *mēnis* and its functioning in maintaining social and cosmic order.

Likewise, then, we find all three elements of Telemakhos’ speech in that of Mentor’s, albeit with slight changes: the wrongs of the suitors are there (O.2.235-238) and the blame is extended to their solidarity group, the Ithacans (O.2.239-241, also O.2.233-234). Where there is a notable difference, however, is in the principle for the maintenance of the proper state of affairs: while in Telemakhos’ speech it is *mēnis*, in Mentor’s it is memory (O.2.233). However, Mentor makes clear that what is being perverted is the sovereign order, that of Odysseus’ position as the king over the Ithacans (O.2.230-234): this complements the role of *mēnis* in maintaining cosmic order, including the hierarchies of the sovereign order between and among gods and men. To underscore the parallelism of their speeches, at this very point Mentor’s words even echo those of Telemakhos’ (cp. πατὴρ δ’ ὣς ἤπιος ἦεν ‘and how kind a father he was’, Telemakhos at O.2.47 and Mentor at O.2.234). Memory thus appears as the flipside of *mēnis*: just as the latter’s function is maintaining the cosmic order as a sanction, a punishment for transgressing the rules, memory is the principle that promotes behavior that agrees with cosmic order.

Telemakhos’ appeal to Nestor makes use of – and demonstrates – the function of memory in the context of appropriate reciprocation, another instance of the ethical aspect of memory: the typical scenario is one where the speaker asks the addressee to remember an earlier favor, and remembering this, it is implied, results in reciprocation of that favor as is fitting. The formula asking for remembering and reciprocation, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι καί μοι… ‘remember them for me now and [do something] for me’ (O.3.100) after mentioning the earlier favor(s) is repeated elsewhere in similar contexts, and so appears to be traditional (these exact same lines are repeated in Telemakhos’ appeal to Menelaos at O.4.328-331, and the formula recurs also in Penelope’s prayer to Athena at O.4.762-766).

As the cause of Athena’s *mēnis *here shows, besides failing to remember and therefore to act appropriately, failing to be νοήμων ‘thoughtful,’ ‘intelligent,’ ‘in possession of *noos* [mind]’ and δίκαιος ‘just’ can also lead to behavior that transgresses against the cosmic order. Words indicating mental qualities such as *noos*,* noēmōn *and *phrenes* are linked to the good kind of mindfulness and memory indicated by words such as *mimnēskomai*, and lack of them is associated with behavior that incurs *mēnis *(cp. I.15.128-129). In contrast to the Argives’ failures with respect to their minds and their subsequent punishment, a good mind is given as the reason for unfailing good conduct, for example Eumaios in his sacrifices to the gods on account of his good *phrenes* (O.14.420-421; cp. also O.24.194-195).

This speech by Penelope echoes the themes of those of Telemakhos and Mentor in O.2.63-79, O.2.229-241. When she asks her rhetorical question of whether the suitors listened to their parents tell of Odysseus, Penelope maintains, like Mentor, that it is ignorance or forgetfulness of Odysseus’ kindness as a ruler that explains the suitors’ arrogance. *ἀκούετε* (O.4.688), “you (pl.) hear,” here corresponds to a function of *mimnēskomai*, ‘remember’, when the latter denotes the performance of *klea andrōn*, epic songs about the glory of men: as *mimnēskomai* marks the activity of the bard, *akouō*, ‘hear’, is what the audience would do. The applicability of this constellation of concepts to the present passage is supported by Penelope’s insistence that Odysseus’ actions in the past were not only praiseworthy, but in fact also the subject of discourse – we can picture the suitors’ parents performing *klea andrōn*, specifically the *kleos* of Odysseus.

She also echoes Mentor, as well as Telemakhos, when she spells out that the suitors’ behavior is no fitting return for Odysseus’ treatment of his fellow men, and that the appropriate kind of reciprocation is manifestly not to be had (O.4.693-695). Where she differs from Mentor and Telemakhos, however, is in articulating the idea of reciprocity by using the term *kharis*, which here could be translated as ‘gratitude’, though its range of meanings is wider. In her speech, then, a connection is drawn between memory and reciprocity, specifically reciprocity denoted by *kharis *(see O.22.318-319 and my note there on the conventionality of the idea that good deeds deserve good *kharis *in return, and when that does not happen, the social system is being perverted).

Looking at how Telemakhos’, Mentor’s, and Penelope’s speeches converge on a topic but use different vocabulary to articulate what is involved makes apparent the connections between these key terms. We perceive the parallelism of *mēnis* and memory and their association with reciprocity in Telemakhos’ and Mentor’s speeches on the one hand, and the connection between memory and reciprocity denoted by *kharis *in particular in Penelope’s on the other. In addition, just as we can see that memory and *mēnis* are closely linked to *themis*, proper conduct, and upholding the cosmos (e.g. in Telemakhos’ speech in O.2), so the social role of *kharis*, especially as a force for or indication of proper social order (as in Penelope’s speech here), fits well in this network of concepts. Indeed, since the reciprocation of *kharites* (plural of *kharis*) is intended to establish a stable relationship with benefits to both parties, it appears to create an effect similar to that of the fear of *mēnis* or the positive guidance of memory. Just as *mēnis* and memory work to maintain the existing world order, so relationships of *kharis* are a further manifestation of the stability of the cosmos (see further O.24.281-286 and my note there on the connections between *kharis* and *themis*). Furthermore, a relationship of *kharis* involves memory (cp. e.g. dedications such as CEG 332 calling themselves *mnāma*), which can, in part, explain its similarity – or its kinship – to the purposes of *mēnis* and memory. The ideal of a remembering relationship of *kharis* as a manifestation of good behavior, however, is the opposite of what Penelope is talking about: in the scenario she describes, there is no *kharis*, no good conduct, and no memory of Odysseus. Compare Hesiod *Works and Days* 182-194 on the disruption of social order, proper reciprocal relationships and lack of *kharis*.

Penelope’s prayer to Athena to save Telemakhos in return for the sacrifices Odysseus has made for the goddess is another example of the function of memory in the context of appropriate reciprocation, as seen with Telemakhos with Nestor (O.3.98-101) and Menelaus (O.4.328-331). This scene between Penelope and Athena offers a slight variation in that the addressee is a divinity and the earlier favor a sacrifice; however, the interrelation of memory and proper reciprocation remains the same, including the use of the formula, τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι καί μοι… ‘remember them for me now and [do something] for me’ (O.4.765).

Compare Sappho fr. 5.3-7: praying for the wishes of someone to be fulfilled, combined with bringing *kharmata *to friends and pain to enemies appears to be traditional. Both here and in Sappho, the context is that of achieving a *nostos* after dangerous seafaring.

Odysseus is wishing Nausicaa a marriage like his own: for the likemindedness of Odysseus and Penelope, see e.g. O.18.281-283 on their similarity in cunning and O.24.192-195 on their good minds. Singling out likemindedness as the greatest good for the couple accords also with the Hesiodic representation of the fifth age of men, where the lack of likemindedness is the most prominent sign of the failures of this age (*Works and Days* 182-184).

Odysseus’ contemplation of the ideal feast while visiting the Phaeacians presents us with a picture of the sort of situation where *kharis* (reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of *kharis*) points to the upholding of good social order, and the meal can be seen as a manifestation of the good social bond in the community. Here, not only is the ideal meal pleasant, endowed with *kharis* and *euphrosune*, ‘good cheer’ – Euphrosyne even being the name of one of the Kharites – but it is orderly (*ἑξείης*, “in order,” O.9.8) and upheld as the best state of affairs (*κάλλιστον*, “finest,” “most beautiful,” “best,” O.9.11). The participants in such a meal, then, are morally good, following the principles for good conduct. This ideal meal, endowed with *kharis*, is in stark contrast with the one foreshadowing the doom of the suitors at O.20.392-394 (where see my comment), described as *akharistos*, ‘lacking *kharis*,’ and payback for their evil deeds.

Just as memory is the principle that maintains good behavior and keeps one on the right track (cp. O.2.229-241 and see note there), this passage illustrates the power of forgetting in leading people astray from their proper path and failing to do the right thing. Eating lotus makes Odysseus’ men want νόστου τε λαθέσθαι ‘forget return home’ (the same effect of forgetting caused by lotus at O.9.102). Not only do they no longer think about it, but they are unable to act on it either: it takes Odysseus’ using force to bring them back to their ship and carry on. Indeed, forgetting appears to be one of the main obstacles for Odysseus’ reaching home (cp. O.1.57, O.10.236), and Ithaca, or *nostos*, is one of the two recurring objects of forgetting in the *Odyssey *(the other object being grief, regularly *un*forgettable, e.g. Penelope’s unforgettable grief at the loss of Odysseus, O.1.342). In contrast, it is with a call to *remember* his fatherland that Odysseus’ companions get him to act and make him continue on his way home from Kirke’s island (O.10.472).

This attempt by the Cyclops to trick Odysseus illustrates the way *lanthanein*/*lēthein *is used in the context of speech in the *Odyssey*: in such context *lanthanein*/*lēthein* consistently indicates deceit.

This passage demonstrates the reciprocity, or complementarity, of memory and *mēnis* in the context of upholding proper social and cosmic order and the value system based on reciprocal exchange. Elpenor asks Odysseus to remember (*μνήσασθαι*, O.11.71) him and the funerary rites that are his due so as not to have Elpenor become a *mēnima*, ‘cause of *mēnis*’ (O.11.73), of the gods toward Odysseus. If Odysseus remembers and performs the rites, all is well, the cosmic order is maintained; if he forgets, he will incur *mēnis *as a punishment. Here, too, we can see that memory leads to proper conduct and helps avoid both the wrong courses of action and *mēnis*; *mēnis*, in turn, is the punishment when the rules are transgressed, and the fear of *mēnis* keeps one on the right path. This is central to the complementarity of memory and *mēnis *and neatly illustrated by the passage: when there is memory, there will be no *mēnis*, as memory keeps one mindful of the danger of incurring *mēnis*, and so helps avoid it in the first place. On the contrary, there will only be *mēnis* when this memory is absent. The relationship between memory and *mēnis *is thus not of perfectly symmetrical reciprocity, but the provision of one in the absence of the other.

This phrase about the good mental abilities of a character is here used of Amphinomos, the suitor who appears to be the least rotten of the lot. His better qualities are further brought out in this passage by mentioning that he pleases Penelope the most with words (*μύθοισι*; O.16.397-398) and that he thinks well (*ἐῢ φρονέων*, O.16.399), in both cases vocabulary we can see elsewhere in the *Odyssey *to connect with a good mind and memory. The same formulaic phrase *φρεσὶ γὰρ κέχρητ' ἀγαθῇσιν*, “for he had good *phrenes*,” is used of Eumaios and his unforgetful, unfailing observance of the gods (O.14.420-421): the formula indicates the connection between good memory, good *phrenes*, and respect of the cosmic order. Sharing this formulaic description with Odysseus’ exemplarily upright swineherd, Amphinomos appears to be of this more mindful sort, too. This characterisation is furthermore supported by Amphinomos’ deference to the gods’ will (O.16.402-403). Elsewhere, his exceptionality among the suitors is brought out in his treatment of Odysseus disguised as a beggar (O.18.122-123): he is deferential and kind when all others insult Odysseus.

In this passage Penelope appeals to Antinoos in a way that follows the model of the invocational theme. It refers to memory in order to elicit the desirable action, and the usual phrase for the theme is *ἦ οὐ μέμνῃ*, “or do you not remember” (e.g. O.24.115). Here, however, we have a variation on the formulaic phrase, as Penelope says *ἦ* *οὐκ* *οἶσθ&#x27;*, “or do you not know,” to introduce a reminiscence on how Odysseus protected Antinoos’ father from the angry people. Penelope’s appeal corresponds to the invocational theme in also including a command: *σε παύεσθαι κέλομαι*, “I order you to stop” (O.16.433; compare the invocational theme at O.24.114). Furthermore, Penelope introduces a past favor to remember – an appeal to the rules of reciprocity. She has chosen a particularly relevant example, one that allows to draw clear parallels between the situation of Antinoos’ father in the past and what the son himself is doing in the present. Just as the people wanted to kill his father, so now the suitors, with Antinoos spearheading the plans, are plotting to kill Telemakhos (O.4.660-672, and again at O.16.363-392). And just as the people also wanted to eat up Antinoos’ father’s livelihood, so the suitors are eating up that of Odysseus (or Telemakhos). These are correspondences that Penelope herself points out specifically (O.16.431-432). What is more, Penelope refers to a social institution that entails bonds of obligation, which has been established between Odysseus and Antinoos’ father: *hiketeia*, ‘supplication’, or the relationship between the suppliant and the supplicated created through the ritual (cp. *xenia*, ‘guest-friendship’) – and these bonds are hereditary. Here Penelope reminds Antinoos of the very institution itself by using a specific term, *ἱκέτας*, “suppliants,” (*Odyssey* 16.422; also *ἵκετο*, “[Antinoos’ father] came [as a suppliant],” O.16.424) to indicate it, and spells out both the origin of this special relationship between his family and that of Odysseus (*Odyssey* 16.424-430), and how Antinoos is breaking it in the current situation (*Odyssey* 16.421-22, 431-32).

It should not, then, take much *noos*, ‘understanding’, ‘intelligence’, ‘mind’, to get the message, but does Anti-*noos* get it? He does not get a chance to respond as Eurymakhos takes over, assuring Penelope that Telemakhos has nothing to fear – while plotting his demise (O.16.419-448). But neither of the two suitors give an indication that Penelope’s speech has the desirable effect, as Eurymakhos’ immediate response and Antinoos’ subsequent behavior show. He instead proves to be worthy of his name, ‘Counter-*noos*.’ It is this faculty, *noos*, which is needed in good working order to avoid transgressing the rules of social and cosmic order, and the lack of which is associated with incurring *mēnis*, the sanction guaranteeing the maintenance of this order. Memory, in a role complementing that of *mēnis*, also upholds this order and these rules, and does so by keeping one mindful, in the right way, of the proper course of action. In addition to containing a variation on the invocational theme’s formulaic phrase appealing to memory, then, Penelope’s speech diverges from it also in not eliciting the morally desirable action.

In this speech by Odysseus, words indicating good mental abilities, *pepnumenos*, ‘being in full possession of one’s senses’, ‘wise’ and *epētēs*, ‘courteous’, ‘gentle’, or, as Annette Dale argues, ‘very proficient in speech,’ are applied to Amphinomos, the noblest among the suitors. The first of these, *pepnumenos*, is often applied to Telemakhos to indicate his good sense (e.g. O.1.367, O.2.208, O.4.593), whereas *epētēs* is used in conjunction with adjectives pointing to good sense: *angkhinoos*, ‘ready of wit’, ‘shrewd’, and *ekhephrōn*, ‘sensible’, literally, ‘having *phrenes*’ – and all three are applied to Odysseus, a prime example of possessing a good mind (O.13.322, the only other occurrence of *epētēs* in Homer). Furthermore, *epētēs*, especially in the sense ‘very proficient in speech,’ ties in with Amphinomos’ description at O.16.397-398: that he is most pleasing to Penelope when it comes to speech (see also my comment at O.16.397).


In another passage illustrating Amphinomos’ positive difference from the rest of the suitors, he seconds Telemakhos’ reproach of the suitors’ riotousness at supper and suggestion it is time they go home (O.18.414-421). Amphinomos maintains that Telemakhos is right and proposes a libation before they head home - and here too, his ability at speaking plays a part: what he says is to all *ἑαδότα μῦθον*, “a pleasing speech” (O.18.422). His good sense not only leads to sensible speech, but his speech is effective, he can persuade his listeners: the suitors leave. So even in one of the suitors – the noblest one – we are shown the connection between good sense and speaking well, and that the first needed for the second.

Penelope’s memory and mindfulness of her marriage to Odysseus are exceptional in the *Odyssey*: other women, we are told (O.15.20-23), tend to forget their previous marriage and children when remarrying, but Penelope here, in proposing the contest of the bow to determine the successful suitor, presents herself as doing the opposite (these lines are repeated at O.21.77-79 when she actually issues the challenge). Compare O.24.194-198, where Agamemnon singles out Penelope’s memory of Odysseus as that which deserves commemorating as a *kleos*. Penelope stands out as an example of socially ethical behavior.

In this passage we see that the suitors’ lack of *kharis *in their dealings with Odysseus’ household is repaid by an *akharistos* meal, one that has no *kharis* (as the term applies to the reciprocal exchange of good turns; see O.24.281-286 and my comment there for this meaning of *kharis*). Although the end of the passage, “for they were the first to contrive unseemly things” (O.20.394), appears to explain the meal’s lack of *kharis *as a result of Athena’s and Odysseus’ initiative in unjust machinations, according to Penelope, the suitors have done *ἀεικέα ἔργα*, “unseemly deeds,” before this. Furthermore, she connects the suitors’ unseemly deeds directly with a lack of *kharis* in return for good deeds (O.4.694-695, where see my comment). The lack of *kharis* in this meal as the reciprocation of the lack of *kharis* in the suitors’ feasting in Odysseus’ house, therefore, is another manifestation of the interconnections of *kharis*, reciprocity and social order, and the concerns regarding them that run through the fabric of the *Odyssey*.

The inset narrative of how Odysseus came to have the bow that Penelope challenges the suitors to string and shoot with in order to win her hand has (as often for inset narratives in the Homeric poems) layers of meaning relevant to the main narrative. The bow is a gift of friendship from Iphitus, whom Odysseus meets while in Messene to collect a debt owed by the Messenians: they had taken three hundred sheep and their shepherds from Ithaca. Iphitus likewise is in search of twelve lost mares. The situation framing their encounter sets out a model for how reciprocation should work, even if “negative” as here, starting in theft: Odysseus is due recompense for the three hundred sheep and their shepherds. The theft of the sheep and shepherds parallels the suitors’ slaughtering of and feasting on Odysseus’ livestock and abuse of his household.

The suitable recompense for the suitors’ arrogance is foreshadowed in the story of the bow, as well. The twelve mares that Iphitus has come to reclaim turn out to be his undoing when Herakles kills him to keep the mares. Herakles does this while a guest in Iphitus’ house, without regard for the fact that he is offered food there – and without regard for the *opis *of the gods (O.21.28: *σχέτλιος, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν αἰδέσατ’*, “merciless one, and he did not fear the *opis* of gods”). Watkins (1977) has shown that *opis* is synonymous with *mēnis*. In comparing this line with a nearly identical one in Hesiod’s *Works and Days* (*σχέτλιοι, οὐδὲ θεῶν ὄπιν εἰδότες*, “merciless ones, and they did not know the *opis* of gods,” 187) where the transgressions incurring the *opis* are also listed*, *it is evident that divine retribution for transgression against the rules that maintain the cosmic order is meant. The scene between Herakles and Iphitus is one of hospitality (O.21.28-29), which parallels the situation between the suitors and Odysseus in the main narrative. Just as Herakles in the inset narrative breaks the rules of hospitality, so in the framing narrative do the suitors. Where the inset narrative contrasts with the main narrative is in the punishment: unlike Herakles, the suitors do not get out scot-free. The instrument of their undoing is the bow, the weapon that gives rise to this inset narrative. It is a gift of friendship (O.21.35), and as Seaford (1994) notes, it embodies the relationship of guest-friendship and the rules of hospitality; as such, it is an appropriate punisher for the abuse of hospitality. I would like to add that we are even told that Odysseus does not take this bow with him when he goes to Troy, but leaves it at home as a *μνῆμα ξείνοιο φίλοιο*, “a reminder of a dear guest-friend” (O.21.40). Appropriately, in a further way, then, the instrument of the suitors’ punishment embodies also the memory that leads to good conduct as a marker and upholder of a relationship of exchanging *kharites*, the reciprocal exchange of good turns.

This speech of Leiodes the sacrificing priest as he begs Odysseus to spare him during the massacre of the suitors contains a line ending that also appears in Penelope’s speech at O.4.695: οὐδέ τίς ἐστι χάρις μετόπισθ’ εὐεργέων, “and there is no *kharis* afterwards for good deeds.” Here, Leiodes claims that he has not done anything, but will lie dead beside the suitors, “and there is no *kharis* afterwards for good deeds” (O.22.318-319). Although Odysseus does not believe him and slays him, Leiodes’ words confirm the conventionality of the thought: good deeds deserve good *kharis *in return, and when that does not happen, the social system is being perverted.

These words of Agamemnon show that the likeminded couple, Penelope and Odysseus (cp. O.6.181-184), is worthy of [#kleos](/tags/kleos), a glorious epic song – and what is more, this *kleos* is characterized by [#kharis](/tags/kharis). His praise makes the source of *kleos* in the *Odyssey* explicit. It is the mind (*phrenes*, O.24.194) of Penelope and her remembering Odysseus (O.24.195) that is worthy of celebration. And it is, again, a *much-contriving* Odysseus (O.24.192), his epithet pointing to his mental abilities, who has the luck of having Penelope as his wife. Although what exactly the *arēte*, ‘excellence’ (O.24.193, O.24.197), that both gives rise to this song and is its subject, is *in*, is left somewhat ambiguous, or even whether it is the *arēte* of Penelope or Odysseus – or, as I would like to take it, of the couple together – we can see that mental abilities are central to it, and throughout the *Odyssey*, the couple standing out for theirs are Penelope and Odysseus.

Further, Agamemnon’s words show the connection between the worthy achievements and their commemoration in song very clearly. Agamemnon speaks specifically of songs and reputation conveyed through them, contrasting Penelope with Klytaimestra. The balance of the comparison of the two women creates an effect of symmetrical opposition. As Penelope is called *κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου*, “daughter of Ikarios” (O.24.195), so Klytaimestra is *Τυνδαρέου κούρη*, “daughter of Tyndareos” (O.24.199), both named through their fathers, but with the word order reversed as if to draw out the contrast between them. While Penelope *εὖ μέμνητ’ Ὀδυσῆος, / ἀνδρὸς κουριδίου*, “well remembered Odysseus, her wedded husband” (O.24.195-196), Klytaimestra *κακὰ μήσατο ἔργα, / κουρίδιον κτείνασα πόσιν*, “devised her evil deeds, killing her wedded husband” (O.24.199-200). In both cases, the object of the wife’s action is her respective husband, both times qualified by “wedded” (there is perhaps even a suggestion of further parallelism in the alliterative echoing in *memnēt’*, ‘remembered’, and *mēsato*, ‘devised’). As Penelope occasions *κλέος*, “song of glory,” and *ἀοιδὴν / […] χαρίεσσαν*, “*kharis*-filled song,” to delight mortals (O.24.196-198), so Klytaimestra gives rise to *στυγερὴ […] ἀοιδὴ*, “hateful song,” among humans (O.24.200-201), the words and phrases mirroring one another again. The parallelism and even repetitions of specific words and phrases concretely demonstrates the opposition between the two kinds of song, the praise poetry of epic on one hand, and the blame poetry on the other.

Finally, *khalepe*, ‘grievous’, ‘harsh’, ‘hard to bear’, that qualifies the repute Klytaimestra gives women is the same word as we have seen in Mentor’s speech qualifying the harsh (*khalepos*, O.2.232) king that he takes the Ithacans to deserve for not remembering Odysseus. Therefore, in the polarities between good, ethical conduct and memory on the one hand and bad behavior and incurrence of *mēnis* on the other, Klytaimestra’s song would fall on the side of the latter, leading to grief and pain. If we compare this picture with that presented by Odysseus in his wishes for a happy marriage to Nausikaa, we can see that this pain aligns with the *algea*, ‘griefs’, suffered by the enemies of the ideal likeminded couple (O.6.184). In contrast, the good person’s praise poetry in Agamemnon’s exclamation is characterized by *kharis*: the *kleos* is an *aoidē khariessa*, a ‘*kharis*-filled song’ (O.24.197-198), just as the likemindedness of the couple in Odysseus’ wishes for Nausikaa is the cause of *kharmata*, ‘source of joy’ (O.24.185), for their well-wishers. And here we have one such well-wisher, Agamemnon, exclaiming on the happiness of Odysseus and Penelope, and even calling their *kleos* *kharis*-filled himself.

In this passage, Laertes provides us with more insights on the proper kind of relationship of *kharis*, of reciprocal exchange of good turns. Most importantly, he specifies what is *themis*, right in accordance with the rules that enforce cosmic hierarchy and proper social behavior, in relationships of *kharis*: the ample reciprocal exchange of gifts and hospitality (O.24.285). Both of the key terms for reciprocity, in the form of words connected to *kharis* (*χαρίζεο*, “gave freely,” O.24.283) and *amoibe* (*ἀμειψάμενος*, “having requited,” O.24.285), are present. In addition, the way the *themis* of relationships of *kharis* is phrased, with *ὅς τις ὑπάρξῃ*, “when one has begun,” (O.24.286), implies that the relationship is continuous, with a potentially infinite number or reciprocations. This confirmation the ongoing nature of *kharis* also supports its connection to memory, which is necessary for sustaining this continuity. This is the kind of reciprocity, Laertes maintains, that Odysseus would have shown.

Laertes also characterizes the suitors (and by extension, especially given the impreciseness of his words, their solidarity group) as *ἀτάσθαλοι ἄνδρες*, “wicked men” (O.24.282). This adjective is applied to their behavior elsewhere in the poem, too, and it is the opposite of Odysseus’ conduct according to Penelope (O.4.693). Laertes also characterizes the suitors as *ὑβρισταὶ*, “men of *hubris*,” making explicit their status as violators of the rules maintaining the cosmic order (cp. O.24.458 on *atasthalia*; O.1.368, O.3.206-207, O.4.321, O.4.625-627, O.16.85-86, O.16.410, O.15.328-329 on *hubris*). The contrast drawn here between the suitors and Odysseus implies that what qualifies the suitors as men of *hubris* is their failure in matters of *kharis* in accordance with *themis*. What Laertes says of the suitors matches what we see in Penelope’s speech at O.4.687-695 (where see my comment).

Zeus’ speech here offers a solution to what may appear to be the beginning of a continuous cycle of violence and one of the tensions set up early in the poem. The speech recalls that of Telemakhos’ to the assembly, which forecast the threat of *mēnis* to the suitors and Ithacans (O.2.63-69). Instead of the extension of the retributive power of *mēnis* to the suitors’ solidarity group, however, Zeus here proposes to cancel it with the help of divinely inspired total forgetting of the suitors and their killing (ἔκλησιν, O.24.485). We can see that *lēthē* is opposed not only to memory, but also to its flipside *mēnis*. Furthermore, by comparing Zeus’ speech with that of Mentor’s in the assembly, another way in which it resolves the tensions set up in the poem becomes apparent: just as Mentor says that the Ithacans deserve a harsh ruler for not remembering how kind a ruler Odysseus was (O.2.230-234), here Zeus promises that Odysseus will in fact continue to rule, and there will be love between him and his subjects. This outcome, too, depends on the *eklēsis*, and so we can see that the ills resulting from *mēnis* and not remembering are both countered by this divine forgetting, further underlining their parallelism.
