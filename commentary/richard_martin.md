This line marks the first appearance of the word *mûthos* in the *Iliad*. Here Agamemnon addresses Chryses; he κρατερὸν δ᾽ ἐπὶ μῦθον ἔτελλε. Often this word is translated simply as *word* or *speech*. However, it is apparent in this line that *mûthos* is not just a speech but also an act that displays authority. On the one hand, *mûthos* is a performance of Agamemnon’s power over Chryses. On the other, it is a performance before the troops intended to persuade the audience that his action is appropriate. In general, the word *mûthos* is best understood as a speech-act which is performed in order to augment, diminish, or negotiate the status and power of speakers in the *Iliad*. In the *Iliad* all* muthoi* are performed at length, usually in public, and comprise a range of speech-genres. However, all but 12 of the 167 occurrences of the stem *muth*- (noun and verb forms) in the *Iliad* can also be categorized as marking proposals and commands or threats and boasts. These discourses can be further categorized into three genres:

\r\n1. Commands (See Zeus’s command via Iris at *Iliad* 8.399-408)
2. Boast-and-insult contests (see Agamemnon’s *epipolesis *in *Iliad* 4)
3. The recitation of remembered events (see Nestor at *Iliad* 1.259-274)

\r\nThus each hero in the *Iliad* is a performer who utilizes these genres in order to compete within Homeric society. *mûthos* then is an authoritative self-presentation of the speaker to the audience which can be directly contrasted with the Homeric word *epos*: a short utterance that accompanies but does not constitute performance.

\r\nUltimately, Homeric poetry itself can be understood as *mûthos*. It is “poetry meant to persuade, enacted in public, created by authority, in a context where authority is always up for grabs and to be won by the speaker with the best style” (Martin 1993:238).
