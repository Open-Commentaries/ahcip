This line features a syntactic formula of the type described by Milman Parry (Parry 1928:17-19 =  Parry 1971:14-16). It consists of the accusative of the noun *mênis* (μῆνιν, usually translated as 'rage, wrath, anger') at the beginning of the line followed by a subjective genitive name (of the person whom the *mênis *inhabits) with epithets that concludes the line, as in *Iliad* 1.75, 5.444, 16.711, 19.75 (in the last attestation, the grammatical pattern is the same except that the genitive is not subjective or objective); another multiform of this syntactic pattern occurs in *Iliad *19.35, where a dative of the *object* of the anger (Agamemnon) occurs whereas a subjective genitive is found in the other examples. Either epithets for the name or a verb governing the accusative fill up the space between line-initial μῆνιν and the name + epithet combinations at the end of the line; the current line is the only example we have in which an imperative verb and a term of address, θεά, occur in that space, but then again, this is the *prooimion* of the poem, not the narrative proper. One expects variation in traditional dictional patterns when the context varies, and in this case the variation pertains exactly to the conventional content of this context. One can also say that the traditional diction *points at* or *highlights* a conventional narrative usage by placing it in an extra-narrative context.


Like every word in the epic song-generating system, *mênin*, the first word of the poem has expressive dimensions that were disclosed to its original audiences and performers through age-old, recurrent exposure to this poetry in performance. Those dimensions are invisible to us — unless we strive to rebuild them from the existing corpus of Homeric poetry. So this word  means potentially more and potentially different things than the English words “rage” or “anger” with which it is usually translated. A contextual analysis that this commentary will track over the course of the poem supports one point that we anticipate here. *mēnis *is a keyword of a 'theme' or relatively formalized, larger unit of traditional content (for a working definition of the term ‘theme’ in the study of traditional poetry, see Lord 2000: ch. 4). That theme recurs within a more or less consistent set of episodes and diction elsewhere in the Homeric corpus, so its occurrence evokes a set of narratives that have a discernible pattern or patterns. We will signal the details of the patterns and their recurring diction as they reach the reader’s eyes. However, we signal now that a most illuminating instance of the *mênis* theme, which would make good reading *before* reading or re-reading the beginning of the *Iliad*, occurs at *Iliad* 15.1-142.

The epithet *oulomenē* ‘disastrous’ here at I.01.002, which describes the narrative subject of the entire performed narration of the *Iliad* as designated by the driving word *mēnis* ‘anger’ at I.01.001, is now immediately followed at I.01.002 by a relative clause that outlines the plot of this narration. Similarly, the epithet *lugros* ‘disastrous’ at O.01.327, which describes the poetic subject of a performed narration as designated by the driving word *nostos* ‘homecoming, song of homecoming’ at O.01.326, is then immediately followed at O.01.327 by a relative clause that outlines the plot of that narration. See the comment on O.01.326–327.

That is a legitimate interpretation based on the conventions of epic syntax and of a parallel prooimion in Odyssey 8.81-82 (which coordinates the πήματος ἀρχή 'beginning of suffering' with the 'plans/wishes of Zeus') , but it is also a convention of epic prooimia to specify the starting point of the poem, so it is reasonable to think that the audience could at the same time sense that ἐξ οὗ δή 'right from the time when' also goes back to the verb ἄειδε 'sing!' in line 1, specifying the starting point of the song as the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, which line 8 then confirms.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":415,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":428,"length":7,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":576,"length":8,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"dsoou","text":"Longer version: The verb ἐτελείετο 'was beginning to be fulfilled' in line 6 is the verb of the third and last paratactic clause after the relative clause ἥ...  in line 2 of the standard prooimion to the Iliad.  The first two finite verbs of the prooimion are aorists (ἔθηκε, προΐαψε) whereas ἐτελείετο and the verb of the previous clause to this one, τεῦχε, are imperfects. As Leonard Palmer 1963 pp.146-148 pointed out, the use of the imperfect after 'establishing' aorists in epic narrative is 'autopsic': it functions to stimulate visualizing/highlighting for the hearers, rather than being reflective of an essential contrast between narrative 'points' (aorist) and enduring narrative moments (imperfect). The essence of the aorist, one could say, is that it is a-horistos 'undefined', or in terms of Prague School linguistics, unmarked as to duration. By contrast, the imperfects do evoke visualization of the past events that they specify as ongoing processes.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":187,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":204,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":246,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":767,"length":10,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":886,"length":22,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"ctmtk","text":"The sentences after the relative clause are linked by the conjunction δέ, the simplest of connectives, and they may not be felt as part of the relative clause.

The problem is that observable conventions of the prooimia to epic narratives like the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Homeric Hymns, require that the starting point of the narrative be specified in the prooimion. So one would think that ἐξ οὗ δή 'right from when' depends on the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε 'sing,' in that the poet is asking the muse to sing from the correct starting point. And in fact the starting point actually is (at least nominally) the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles, as is made clear by line 8, even though the poem immediately has to backtrack in order to set it up as the starting point.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":465,"length":3,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":474,"length":4,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":972,"length":8,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1009,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1020,"length":7,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1037,"length":13,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1121,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1273,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"3ha","text":"On the other hand, is it possible that ἐξ οὗ δή 'right from when'  in the wording of this prooimion could also be specifying that the quarrel between the two of them is the point when the plan/will of Zeus (as against the μῆνις of Achilles) started on its path to fulfillment? To put it another way, is the plan of Zeus coterminous with the Iliad, or should we think of it as something that overlaps it, that began before and ended after it? How can we know? I would argue that the plan/will of Zeus is a cause that starts and completes with the song on the basis of the diction in the first song of Demodocus in Odyssey 8.81-82, where the πήματος ἀρχή 'the beginning (sic) of suffering' began to roll (κυλίνδετο, imperfect) Διὸς μεγάλου διὰ βουλάς 'because of the plans (plural) of great Zeus.' It (the suffering) was prophesied by Apollo at Delphi as starting when the ἄριστοι Ἀχαιῶν 'best (plural) of the Achaeans' δηριόωντο 'quarreled' (again, imperfect) — on this point, see G. Nagy here . So the solution to the syntactical dilemma about  ἐξ οὗ δή 'right from when' is that it refers both to the verb ἐτελείετο 'began to be fulfilled' and to the imperative in line 1, ἄειδε 'sing!', because 1) the convention for the specification of the starting point requires it, 2) the conventions of epic paratactic style require it, and 3) the traditional specifics of the plan/plans of Zeus require it to refer to both. Beginning in 1976, G. Nagy has shown in detail how this song of Demodocus is a multiform of our Iliad, and on that basis we can conceive of its diction as stemming from the same tradition as our Iliad. I note that the prooimion to the Odyssey ends with a globally resumptive pronoun τῶν... 'of these things' whose antecedent is all of the contents of the prooimion, just as the narrative of Demodocus' song concludes with ταῦτ' ἄρ' ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός 'these things, you see, the very famous singer began to sing' (8.83). The Iliad prooimion has no such clarifying summative construction, though understanding ἐξ οὗ δή in the way we have means that both ἄειδε at the beginning and ἐτελείετο at the end of the prooimion are the points from which the song begins.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":90,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":184,"length":21,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":341,"length":7,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":613,"length":7,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1090,"length":4,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1141,"length":3,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1512,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1611,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1634,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1651,"length":7,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1771,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1946,"length":5,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1952,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":2129,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"9vhjq","text":"Incidentally, it is also clear just from our Iliad that there could be at least one other starting point for the tale of Achilles' wrath.

The language (*ē*tīmē*sen arētēra*) here specifies that Agamemnon slighted the *tīmē* of Chryses in his role as *arētēr* &#x27;one who prays/curses&#x27;.

The notion of slighted *tīmē* evokes the system of reciprocal exchange between individuals and groups that is the basis of the social system in the epic for mortals and immortals. How this system works and the significance of offenses to it will be tracked in this commentary as part of the treatment of the *mēnis* theme in the poem, to which they are vitally related. As G. Nagy has shown in *Best of the Achaeans,* in Epic there is both a divine and a human sense of the word *tïmē*: in the divine world, *tīmē* means the &#x27;sphere&#x27; in which a divinity operates. For example one part of the sphere of Apollo is both the causing and the healing of *loimos* &#x27;plague&#x27;. By contrast, in the warrior domain, *tīmē* means an individual&#x27;s social prestige within the group. This differentiation in meaning is because of the division of labor that obtains among the divinities and of the *absence* of the division of labor among the heroes — or, to put it another way, to the fact that all members of the warrior class in theory at least compete for excellence in the same set of spheres, which are the ones that are divided up into specializations among the gods. So the same term,  *timē*, can mean general prestige for humans and specific prerogatives for gods. The gods do not conflict with one another except when the boundaries between their *prerogatives* are not respected, whereas the heroes conflict with each when their *prestige* as warriors is not respected.

On the other hand, the old man Chryses, unlike the warriors, is a human being *with a sphere or prerogative* that is specified along with the fact that he has been slighted. In other words, what Agamemnon has done is to slight his prerogative as a person who prays/curses, not his general prestige in the specialized domain of warriors.

The traditional epithet used here for the *apoina* 'payment of goods offered in exchange for someone' is the word *apereisi'* 'limitless', an adjective that occurs eleven times in Homeric epic at exactly this point in the line to qualify the neuter plural noun *apoina*. It also occurs twice, again in the same place in the line, in the form *apereisia* (without the last syllable elided) as the epithet of the noun *eedna* 'wedding gift' (Iliad 16.178, Odyssey 19.529; also Hesiod Frag. 198.10 [M-W], with the same line-placement as all other attestations). Like the word *apoina*, *eedna* also designates goods given as part of a transaction, but the transaction in question is always and only a wedding, and the goods go with a woman. The fact that *apereisia *'limitless' is an otherwise unattested traditional epithet shared only between these two kinds of exchange means that there are analogies between them. The difference between the two is that in a wedding, the gift-goods go *with* the woman, the third person whose ownership is being transferred from her father's household to her husband's father's household, whereas in a 'payment' like the one being proposed to Agamemnon here, the goods are *in exchange for* the third person, male or female, whose ownership is being transferred between two others — in this particular case, from Agamemnon to her father. In effect, what Chryses is proposing to Agamemnon and Menelaus and all the Achaeans is the reverse of a wedding gift: the father seeks to *retrieve* his daughter from a kind of spouse (in rejecting the offer, Agamemnon soon says that he actually prefers her to his own wife, Iliad 1.111-115)  by the offer of gift-goods in exchange for her.


Now we can understand why the goods offered in payment in both cases are qualified as 'without end/limit'. Such exchanges resemble an extreme form of exchange analyzed in detail by Marcel Mauss (see the note on Iliad 1.13-15) called *potlatch.* Among the Amerindians of the Pacific Northwest, positively ruinous amounts of prestige goods are offered in exchanges between groups, and the exchanges even include the flagrant casting of precious valuables into the sea, the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption. The idea behind *potlatch* and the epithet *apereisia* for a payment in this instance or in the case of a wedding seem to me the same: in theory at least, they are offers of exchange that cannot be refused, and they are designed to display the ultimate wealth, prestige, and power of the party that offers them, though like other gifts they appear on the surface to be generous. Their extreme nature is also designed to be absolute in its effectiveness: the 'limitless' wedding gift cements the marriage because the husband's father's household will never give up such wealth (if the bride leaves the marriage, the wealth goes with her!), and Chryses' 'limitless' payment perfects the *disjunction* between the two parties because the wealth offered in exchange for the woman is beyond adequate as compensation for her. The key is, as Mauss showed, that gifts are both obligatory to give, obligatory to receive, and they generate obligations in return among those who receive them. The bigger the gifts the more stringent the obligations. So what happens if the gifts are 'infinite', as here? It would seem that the obligations are then absolute.

Chrysēs came to the ships to engage in an exchange, a behavior that the anthropologist/sociologist Marcel Mauss described as the basic form of social contract in archaic societies. Archaic exchange systems, he said, are "total social phenomena", in that they seamlessly interweave *economic*, *sacral*, and *social *or* group* interaction. That is exactly what we see here: the intention to exchange involves Chrysēs with the whole social group (l. 15, πάντας Ἀχαιούς, 'all Achaeans'), it requires of him the transfer of wealth —the verb φέρω 'carry, bear' (l. 13) designates the movement of prestige goods that cannot move by themselves—, and it is accompanied by the display of sacred symbols referred to the god Apollo, namely wreaths on a golden scepter (lines 14-15).

This attempt at exchange may look to us like the kind of economic transaction that only occurs between civilized people and criminals. It is customary to translate the word λυσόμενος in line 13 with the English word 'ransom', because for us, the exchange of human beings for goods is 'human trafficking,' which is by definition a heinous evil. Mauss also clarifies this problem, which is one of the most difficult aspects of an archaic exchange system for us to understand. In the world of Homeric epic, Mauss would say, humans are exchangeable for goods not because humans are commodified or objectified, but because *goods are humanized*, because they are as dear and as attached to human beings as human beings are to each other. Lacking a medium of exchange like coins or bills, which can dehumanize even prestige goods made by artists or skilled craftsmen, people in the Epic world not only identify themselves with what we call objects (as we sometimes do), they also do not categorically distinguish between people and things as property types. Instead, the regnant distinction is between immovable goods (those which cannot move themselves), like tripods or golden cups or woven goods, and movable ones (those which can move themselves), like cattle or human beings or slaves.

The noun *apoina* 'payment' occurs as the object of the verb *dekhesthai* 'receive, accept' in various forms six times in the Iliad (Iliad 1.20, 1.23, 1.111, 1.377, 6.46, 11.131) and once in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite (l. 140); the same is true of the noun *poinē* 'payment, blood money' (Iliad 9.633, 9.636, 17.207-208), which is derived from the same root as *apoina. * Another verb is used once to denote *not* 'accepting' a *poinē* in the legal dispute described on Achilles' shield  at Iliad 18.501, namely *helesthai* 'take for oneself'. There is a demonstrably living analogy between *poinē* and *apoina*, as one can see from the context of Iliad 9.632-637, which draws an explicit parallel between the two, so the use of a different verb, *helesthai, *in the instance of a negated *poinē,* reinforces the normality of the syntactic formula is *apoina* + forms of *dekhesthai* 'to accept'.

Payments designated as *apoina* in Homeric epic are customarily accepted. We can say that the traditional diction is equipped for that, and in archaic exchange systems as described by Mauss, there are symmetrical obligations: there is an obligation to accept an offer to exchange just as there is an obligation to reciprocate appropriately once one accepts an exchange. There are exceptions to those obligations, but they are fraught with danger and power for all concerned. One such exception is this one, the first scene in the Iliad, in which Agamemnon rejects the *apoina* of Chryses. For another example, we can point to Achilles fighting in the river Xanthos at the beginning of Iliad 21, when he comes upon the Trojan Lycaon, a son of Priam whom he had not long before captured and 'sold' — the difference between 'selling' and giving *apoina* for a person is not to be pressed (see *peperēmenos *'having been sold' 21.58, 21.78 vs. 21.99 *apoina *for the same transaction as well as the extremely archaic expression *ōnon edōke* 'paid a price' at 21.41 for another transaction of the same type). Lycaon grabs Achilles by the knees in the posture of a suppliant, in other words, a person urgently requesting a customarily obligatory "favor". Yet Achilles tells him that his (Achilles') days of accepting payment for captives, which he did often before (21.100-102), have ended with the death of Patroklos, especially, he says, when it comes to the sons of Priam. Then, by way of consolation for both himself and Lycaon, Achilles goes on to describe the coming day of his own death, at dawn or midday or in the afternoon, by a spear or an arrow from a bowstring (21.106-113). Then he kills Lycaon, brutally, confronting us, too, with the moment of death for a person who has just come to life for us in the narrative. For a third example, there is Achilles' refusal of Agamemnon's *apoina* for him in Iliad 9, but as we shall see, there are significant anomalies in that failed transaction that are not present in this instance or in Achilles' refusal of Lycaon. A better parallel to the present moment is the legal dispute on Achilles' shield, which turns on the question, in what circumstances the refusal of a *poinē* could be proper — with the implication that there may or may not be such circumstances.

The language precisely contrasts the response of 'all the other Achaeans' (*alloi...pantes...Akhaioi*, l. 22) with that of Agamemnon, 'but not to Agamemnon son of Atreus' (*all' ouk Atreidēi Agamemnon, *l. 24) to the offer of a 'limitless ransom' by the old man, Chryses. That Agamemnon's response paces him in a minority of one is another sign that the offer of payment is obligatory by custom and that its refusal is dangerous and powerful when viewed in the context of other offers of *apoina* 'payment' and their refusal/acceptance (see notes above on *Iliad* 1.13, 1.13-15, and 1.20; for a parallel to Agamemnon's isolated position here, see Odyssey 3.141-143). D. Elmer (2103, pp. 30-31 and chapter 3, pp. 63-85) argues that the diction describing the collective response of  all the Achaeans (*alloi...pantes epeuphēmēsan Akhaioi* 'all the other Achaeans shouted their approval', l. 22) is also exceptional, not the standard way of expressing communal opinion, as is the utter refusal of Agamemnon to hear and heed their response in rejecting the offer. Note also the semantic parallelism between the earlier expression 'he slighted the prestige of the one who prays/curses' (of Chryses, l. 11, previewing Agamemnon's reaction here), and the Achaeans request that he, by contrast, 'show the priest respect'  (*aideisthai hierēa*, l. 23). *Aidōs* (seen here in its denominative verb *aideisthai*) is another key term in the vocabulary of social value, where a person's *aidōs* 'respect' is a function of a figure's *timē* 'prestige, prerogative'. That is why he is again described in his social function as priest, just as he was described as 'the one who prays/curses' in the earlier formulation. In line 23, note again the parallelism and implied equivalence between engaging in exchange (*aglaa dekhthai apoina* 'to accept the splendid payment') and showing respect for the priest (*aideisthai **hierea*), because a person's value to the society is manifest in the way in which he or she participates in exchange.

In rejecting the offer of Chryses, Agamemnon ignores the norms of exchange behavior made concrete by the expression of the common opinion of everyone else in favor of what pleases his own heart's desire (literally, 'to Agamemnon, to his heart'). David Elmer (2013, p. 42-46) has shown that the verb 'to please' that is used here, *handanein*, is "an essential component of the *Iliad*'s decision-making vocabulary" (p. 44), in which it functions as "a way of signaling divergence from an otherwise cohesive collective will (p. 42)." He also argues that an authoritarian, individualistic preference overriding the collective will is *not* normative behavior in Homeric society, but its opposite. The norm in decision-making in the *Iliad* is for the collective will to be decisive (Elmer 2013, Chapter 1). Furthermore, Agamemnon's divergent response represents a failure to perceive the interwoven social and sacral consequences of his act. Agamemnon himself is not only the titular leader of the whole expedition to Troy on his brother's behalf, manifested in his possession of the epithet *anax andrōn *'lord of men' (an expression that is used of him 49 of the 54 times it occurs in the Homeric and Hesiodic poems), but he is also the wielder of the sacrificial knife (Hitch 2009, Chapter 4), to which we can compare the role of Chryses as the old man who prays/curses and who bears wreaths on a golden *skēptron* 'staff/sceptre' (1.14-15): we have discussed above the overt sacred/social aspects of the system of exchange: see the comments on *Iliad* 1.13-15.

Homeric prayers, of which this is a relatively standard example, are predicated upon the system of gift exchange that also prevails in human social interaction. Their form and content is a function of that and of the way in which oral traditional poetry composes *themes*, which are chunks of conventional discourse that exemplify fixed and variable dictional and semantic elements that vary depending upon the particular context of each instance. What we see in this particular prayer are three structural elements that are generalizable but also variable both as to their content and in their presence or absence: 1) an address to a particular divinity; 2) a statement that either *generates* a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity by speech-acting the giving of an obligatory gift now or in the future, or a statement that *points to* the past existence of a reciprocal relationship between the speaking human and the divinity on the basis of previous successful interactions based on exchanges; 3) a request on the part of the speaking human that the divinity accomplish something on the human's behalf as a function of the divinity's present, past, or future obligation to do so because of the exchange relationship that is being generated, will be generated, or has existed in the past.

So here, Chrysēs first 1) names the divinity in local terms (1.37-39) for the god Apollo — he is not so named but has been identified by his Olympian name in the narrative preceding the prayer as its addressee (1.35); 2) states that in the past, he has put the roof on temples (in other words, completed their construction) and burnt thigh pieces, the choicest part of the sacrificial animals, bulls and goats, as gifts to the divinity that serve as the basis of the request that is coming next; and 3) requests that the divinity fulfill his wish, namely, "may the Danaans *pay for* my tears with your weapons," an example of negative reciprocity in which bad is returned for bad, just as the overall prayer itself is based on the exchange of good for good.

This line is a multiform of the regular formula for concluding prayers that are labelled with the verb *eukhomai*, which is a word that designates three different kinds of discourse by using mutually exclusive formulas for each of the three. It has a two-part structure extending  from the line-beginning to the oblgatory word-break within the third foot and from the obligatory word-break to the end of the line. The first chunk, *hōs ephat'/ephan eukhomenos/ē/oi/ai*, whose subject is always a previously identified mortal or mortals, designates that the discourse that precedes the line was a prayer and is concluded, and the second chunk, *tou d' eklue* |¯˘˘ | ¯˘#, designates that the divinity addressed, whose name + epithet combination is specified in the space at the end of the line, 'heard' (*eklue*, cognate with the English word '(k)listen') the prayer (for Poseidon, just the epithet *kuanokhaitēs 'with a glossy blue mane' occurs*, since his name + epithet combinations are too long to fit the metrical space) . 'Heard' is functionally unmarked in English, but in only one of the 25 occurrences of this formulaic line does it mean anything less than accepted and agreed: at *Iliad* 16.250, where Zeus accepts one part of Achilles' request about Patroklos and refuses (the verb is *aneneue* 'was refusing') the other. When the response to the prayer is (exceptionally) negative, the expression *tou/tēs d' eklue* 'and he/she heard him/her' is replaced with *aneneue de + *name + epithet (once, *Iliad* 6.311) 'and she was refusing'  or *nemesēse de* + name + epithet (once, *Iliad* 8.198) 'and she was outraged'. There are also two places where *tou/tēs d' eklue* is replaced with different verbs and divine names to express an exceptionally *positive* response on the part of the divinity (*Odyssey* 2.267 and *Iliad* 15.377). There are also two attestations when the beginning of this line, *hōs ephat' eukhomenos, *is attested in a non-sacral context that evokes one of the other meanings of the verb *eukhomai*, 'boast (of warriors in battle)'; see *Iliad* 5.106 and *Iliad* 20.393, but in both those cases (and in no others) good medieval manuscripts attest a metrically equivalent variant *hōs phat' **ep**eukhomenos *which is actually attested in the meaning 'boast' without variants in *Homeric Hymn to Apollo* 370; so it is clear that just the first half of this formulaic line is, despite a plausible ambiguity, traditionally associated with the meaning 'pray' in sacral contexts.

In short, this line is a manifestation of a superbly efficient and expressive system for concluding a prayer.

The noun *kēla* that occurs in line is attested in Homeric and Hesiodic poetry by these three formulae at line initial position, line final position, and after the word break in the third foot:

#κῆλα Διός '*kēla* of Zeus' Hesiod, *Theogony* 708 and Fragment 204.138

κῆλα θεοῖο# '*kēla* of a/the god' *Iliad* 1.53=1.383

||πιφαυκόμενς τὰ ἂ κῆλα 'showing those *kēla* of his' Hymn to Apollo 444, *Iliad* 12.280

The formulas designate the weapons of Zeus in three places (*Iliad* 12.280 and the two Hesiodic passages) and the arrows of Apollo in three places (*Homeric Hymn to Apollo* 444 as well as here and in the repetition of this passage at *Iliad* 1.383). In the case of Zeus' *kēla*, it is evident that the reference is to his fiery thunderbolts. What is not immediately apparent is that Apollo's *kēla* are in fact also fire-bearing. Here is the line from the Homeric Hymn:

ἔνθ' ἄρ' ὅ γε φλόγα δαῖε πιφαυσκόμενος τὰ ἃ κῆλα

'there he was making fire blaze, revealing those *kēla* of his...

And in this passage, in the line that just precedes the occurrence of the formula shared by Zeus and Apollo, *kēla* *theoio* 'the god's *kēla*', we read of the fire of pyres as the immediate consequence of Apollo's arrow-shooting in the line immediately before the current one:

Iliad 1.52 βαλλ'· αἰεὶ δὶ πυραὶ νεκύων καίοντο θαμεῖαι

'he was hitting them; and immediately the pyres of corpses were burning thick and fast'

It is as though the *kēla* cause the pyres to burn. In seeking the etymology of this term, an underlying assumption has been, I believe, that what Zeus and Apollo share are arrows or things like them (thunderbolts), and so the etymology of *kēla* has been sought, unsuccessfully, in words in other Indo-European languages for arrows or 'shafts'. But every occurrence of the word in Epic diction evokes *fire* as an aspect of the *kēla*. What is happening on a thematic level is also relevant, because Apollo is here exercising *mēnis* 'cosmic anger' (see *Iliad* 1.75) by way of cosmic arrows — in fact he is functioning as a variant of Zeus, since striking victims with the thunderbolt is the conventional manifestation of Zeus' *mēnis. *And we will see that fire and in fact cosmic fire that goes up to the sky can become an expression of Achilles' *mēnis *as well (on this topic, see also now G. Nagy, "Cataclysm and Ecpyrosis, two symmetrical actions of Zeus as sky-god," *Classical Inquiries*, May 19, 2016, http://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/cataclysm-and-ecpyrosis-two-symmetrical-actions-of-zeus-as-sky-god/). On this level, one might prefer to define this word as 'fiery shafts' rather than just 'shafts'. It is not surprising that a connection was made in the Hesiodic scholia and in a late Byzantine Homeric gloss of this line which perhaps reflects earlier exegetical traditions:

Scholion on *Theogony* 708: <κῆλα Διός:> τὰ καυστικὰ σημεῖα "Zeus's *kēla*: burning signs/omens";

13th Century Byzantine on Iliad 1.51: ...ᾤχετο κῆλα θεοῖο. παρὰ τὸν **κήσω** μέλλοντα τὸν δηλοῦντα τὸ **καύσω**. ὅθεν καὶ τό· πυρὶ κηλέῳ, τουτέστι καυστικῷ,  "*kēla* of the god:  [derived] from the future [form] κήσω, which shows the [verbal form] καύσω. From where also the [phrase]: πυρὶ κηλέῳ 'with blazing fire' (*Iliad *8.217, etc.), that is, καυστικῷ 'burning'") from Pseudo-Zonaras Lexicon, ed. E. Crusius 1808, rear. 1967, alphabetic letter kappa, p. 1206, line 3

It is reasonable to believe that the poetic tradition also sensed the relationship between κῆλα and the verb καίω, whether by way of folk etymology or, perhaps, by way of an inherited etymological relationship.

The adjective κηλέῳ 'blazing' is attested only in the formula πυρὶ κηλέῳ 'blazing fire', in synizesis, six times in line final position, once after the triphthemimeral caesura, and once in the form πυρὶ κηλείῳ before the penthehemimeral caesura.  The form cited just above from the  as the future of the verb καίω, namely κήσω, is not otherwise attested and may be a mistake, but the form ἔκηα (Iliad 1.40 etc.), which is an archaic athematic aorist with the 1st person singular ending *-ṃ* that was later misunderstood as a first aorist ending -α, attests to the verbal root for 'burn' with that vocalism (κη-). That form should be reconstructed as *ἔκηϝα, to which we can compare the Thessalian εκηυα attested in a ?? inscription.

The word ἀριζήλη (*arizēlē* 'perspicuous'), whose repetition bridges tenor and vehicle in this simile, is an intensive form of the adjective δῆλος (*dēlos*), a word that is usually translated 'clear'. As the standard dictionaries and the etymological dictionaries say (see LSJ9 and Chantraine *DEG* s.vv.  δῆλος and ἀρίζηλος), it means 'clear' in a visual sense or in a logical sense, and in that respect, it is unlike the English word 'clear', which is also and unexceptionally used of sounds. In this passage, where the word *arizēlē* applies to a sound, *phōnē*, that issues from the mouth of Achilles and is echoed by the goddess Athena, we have a rare example of synesthesia in epic diction, a metaphor of visibility applied to a sound that is elaborated by a compressed simile that then goes ahead and visualizes a trumpet sounding when a city is besieged by its enemies.

Odysseus is the only epic personage to share with Hermes the epithet *polutropos* (Homeric Hymn 4.13). Similarly, in Homeric Hymn 28.2, the second hymn to Athena , she has the epithet *polumētis* 'cunning in many ways', which is otherwise restricted to Odysseus in the *Iliad* (I.03.216) and the *Odyssey* (O.04.763, O.20.168, 22.1).  By no coincidence, these are the two divinities who preside over the return of Odysseus as planned by Athena and Zeus in this narrative. See also *Odyssey* 1.98 and comments on it below. Note also the only other occurrence of *polutropos* in Homer (O.10.330),  applied to Odysseus by Circe when she figures out who he is because he does not take on the appearance of a pig  and go to the sty when struck by her *rhabdos 'staff, wand'. *She* *explains in the next line (O.10.331) that Hermes (identified only via his epithets, not his name, as though to raise awareness of such terms and who owns them) continually warned her about Odysseus's arrival.

There is parallelism and overlap between Hermes and Athena (here, Athena is wearing Hermes’ sandals) as in the plotting of the narrative itself; see also the comment on O.01.1 above and the way that Athena takes on the appearance of Hermes in O.13.221-231 (also featuring sandals and a spear).

When Odysseus arrives back in Ithaka in *Odyssey *13, he encounters Athene in the shape of young shepherd. After Odysseus lies to her about his identity, Athene reacts with a smile and another transformation:\r\n\r\nὣς φάτο, μείδησεν δὲ θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,\r\n\r\nχειρί τέ μιν κατέρεξε· δέμας δ' ἤϊκτο γυναικὶ\r\n\r\nκαλῇ τε μεγάλῃ τε καὶ ἀγλαὰ ἔργα ἰδυίῃ·\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo he spoke, and the goddess gray-eyed Athene smiled,\r\n\r\nand she stroke him with her hand. And she took on the shape of a woman\r\n\r\nbeautiful and tall and skilled in beautiful handiworks,\r\n\r\nand speaking to him she addressed him in winged words.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSome scholars have interpreted this transformation as the goddess revealing herself to the hero in her true form (e.g., Stanford 1948, *ad* 13.289; Heubeck 1988-1992, *ad *13.288), but as Pucci argues, it is unlikely that Odysseus sees the goddess as she really is (Pucci 1986:7-28). The diction of the passage makes clear that Athene’s appearance “in the shape of a beautiful woman” is as much a disguise as the others she adopts elsewhere: as the poet tells us, “she took on (ἤϊκτο) the shape of a woman.”\r\n\r\nThe formulaic language to describe the goddess’ reaction and transformation has both erotic and maternal connotations. The formula “and she/he stroked him/her with her/his hand” appears seven times in Homeric epic, always to describe intimate moments between mother and child or between lovers. In the *Iliad*, the phrase is mostly used to described mother and child (1.361, 5.372, 23.127) and once of husband and wife (6.484-5). In the *Odyssey* the phrase occurs two other times: Menelaos smiles and strokes Telemachos in a fatherly manner (4.610), and there is perhaps a maternal aspect to Athene’s concern for Odysseus, but the encounter is not without sexual undercurrents, which are also present in the only other Odyssean instance of the phrase, which involves Kalypso smiling and stroking Odysseus (5.180-1).\r\n\r\nWhen Athene strokes Odysseus, the erotic tenor of her gesture is made evident in both her physical transformation and the conversation that follows, which centers on the like-mindedness of the goddess and the hero, a quality Odysseus praises as the basis of a good marriage (*Odyssey *6.183). Athene chooses an appearance that is particularly appropriate to this moment of intimacy between goddess and her mortal protégé: the shape of a seductive woman, beautiful and skilled at handiworks, or in short and as the Greek *gunê* also denotes, a perfect wife endowed with the most desirable qualities. The encounter between goddess and hero in *Odyssey *8 is thus replete with motifs—an encounter with a beautiful female divinity in the countryside, a shrine of the nymphs—usually associated with stories of love between goddesses and men, and Odysseus in this scene is depicted as the notional lover of the goddess, or as a nympholept (*numpholeptos*).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nHeubeck, A. et al. 1998-1992. *A Commentary on Homer’s Odyssey.

Odysseus is about to make a speech that is introduced by the narrator with the same words as the last speech he had made, the one at the end of Rhapsody 14: both are described as *subōteō peirētizōn* “testing the swineherd” (14.459=15.304). The “testing” seems to mean forcing Eumaios to choose between two alternatives: in Rhapsody 15, the narrator says that the goal of Odysseus’ speech is either that Eumaios sustain his ‘continuous affection’ (15.305, *endukeōs phileoi*)<u>[1]</u> for Odysseus and ask him to remain on the pig farm, or instead that he urge Odysseus to take off for the city (15.305-306). In Rhapsody 14, on a dark, rainy, and windy night, Odysseus wants to force Eumaios, again as a sign of his affection for him (14.461), to slip off his own cloak and give it to him, so that he can sleep warm and tight, or to urge one of his men to do so. For a beggar clothed in rags to wangle a cloak and a tunic from someone higher up on the social scale is really asking a lot. The usual request of a beggar is for a cup of wine and a piece of bread,<u>[2]</u> so rather than, “Buddy, can you spare a dime?” it’s more like, “Buddy, can you spare a fur coat?” In fact, Eumaios had predicted (14.131-132) that the disguised Odysseus would gin up any tale he could to get such clothing, so Odysseus’ attempt to do so has an elaborate prologue that suggests self-assertion (and almost self-identification), along with apologizing, for the brazen story he is about to tell, but he goes ahead with it anyway.<u>[3]</u>


Here in Rhapsody 15, Odysseus makes no apology for what he is about to say, but perhaps he should have. To force Eumaios to invite him to stay longer, he reports the contrary, a decision to leave the pig farm in the morning and go into the city, to beg some food and drink, to give Penelope a message, and to interact with the suitors. The next eight lines (15.317-324) conclude his speech, as follows:


> I would immediately **work** [root *dra*- ‘do, work’] well among them, whatever they want.


> I will speak out to you, so understand and listen:


> Because of Hermes *diaktoros*<u>[4]</u>, who awards favor


> And superior renown to the deeds of all human beings,


> When it comes to ‘**working-ness**’ [abstract noun derived from root *dra*-] *no other mortal could compete with me*


> In heaping up fire the good way and splitting dry logs,


> In divvying up the meat and roasting it and pouring wine,


> The kinds of things that lesser men **work at alongside** [compound verb from root *dra*-] the nobles.


So the beggar is touting exceptional skills bestowed upon him by the god Hermes. But why the ones listed, and why with three forms of the verb *dra*- ‘do’? The words that I have highlighted in bold are all derivatives of the verbal root *dra-* that means ‘do’, a common verb in Classical (post-Homeric) Greek meaning ‘do/act’ as well as ‘perform a ritual act,’ but a decidedly rare word in Homer. In fact, each of the forms of it in Odysseus' speech occurs *only here* in all of Homeric epic. The ancient commentators on Homeric poetry say that all three forms in Odysseus’ speech refer to slave/servant behavior, translating the verb ‘serve,’ which would make its meaning in Homer unique, since the verb never occurs in later sources with that sense. The only frequent form of this root in Homeric Greek, the agent noun *drēst-ēr/-eira*, ‘one who does/works’ or ‘one who performs ritual acts,’ actually occurs five times in the *Odyssey,* always in the plural, apparently to designate women or men who are in fact servants or slaves. An examination of its usage, however, reveals that it always designates persons, slaves or not, who are performing ritual activities associated with the treatment of guests. It is also used once of males attached to the household of Odysseus who carry out the splitting of word (mentioned by Odysseus above, see also below) alongside the women preparing for the ritual treatment of guests (20.160).


When it comes to the actions that Odysseus in his testing speech describes himself as the unrivaled master of, thanks to the patronage of Hermes, they are, like the guest rituals, also ritual acts, and he specifies that they are things done by ‘lesser’ men ‘alongside’ the nobility — how much ‘lesser’ is not clear, especially given the word ‘**alongside**.’ All are activities related to the ritual sacrifice and cooking of pastoral animals: the preparation of a fire, the cooking of meat, its division into fair shares, and the pouring of wine over the roasting meat or to consume along with it. The brief mention of splitting wood for the male *drēstēres* in Odysseus’ palace at 20.160 must be preparatory to lighting a fire and cooking meat. In the *Homeric Hymn to Hermes*, all the activities that the disguised Odysseus describes himself as expert in, with the exception of pouring wine, are actually ascribed to Hermes himself. <u>[1]</u>


As the Hellenistic Homeric scholar Aristarchus understood,<u>[2]</u> the traditional function of the person called a *kērux* ‘herald, attendant’ helps to clarify Odysseus’ speech. Hermes is the god of heralds, who carry an emblem of his. In the *Iliad*, heralds are high-status, sacrosanct persons who convey messages and persons across social and, in the god’s case, cosmic boundaries. In the *Odyssey* that status also includes the ritual activities around the preparation of the sacrificial meal, an activity that happens to cross cosmic boundaries. Penelope describes such *kērukes* ‘heralds’ in 19.135 not as slaves but as *dēmioergoi* ‘men who work in the district’, skilled, itinerant workers of various kinds, like healers and singers (interestingly, *kārú-,* the exact cognate in Sanskrit of Greek *kērux*, means 'singer, poet'). The upshot is that the beggar Odysseus is describing himself as having just such skills, and to an unrivalled degree, so there is no need to translate the forms of the verb *dra*- in his speech as anything other than ‘do/work a ritual activity,’ not ‘do a servant’s work.’


Eumaios, however is horrified by Odysseus’ speech touting the unrivalled ritual skills he could perform for the suitors. He asks Odysseus (15.327-334) if he just wants to die, since the violence and the *hubris* of the suitors is infamous. “They don’t have **sub**-workers (root *dra*- again) like you,” he says, “they have young people wearing tunics and cloaks, with glistening heads and beautiful faces, who work **under** (root *dra*-) them, their tables brimming with bread, meat, and wine.” So don’t go into the town, stay with me, he says, and when Telemakhos comes, “he will give you a cloak and a tunic and send you off wherever you wish to go.” In this response, Eumaios twice uses a new *dra*- compound, *hupo-dra-* ‘do/work *under* (the suitors)’ to describe the position that Odysseus is aiming to have, whereas Odysseus had used the form *para-dra-* ‘do/work *alongside*,’ portraying himself and the work as higher-ranking than Eumaios does. The difference between ‘under’ and ‘alongside’ may be small, but the repeated, exceptional use of *dra*- and its derivatives in Odysseus’ speech hints at a coded message, in which the difference in wording bespeaks the *actual* status of Odysseus, who is in truth more than a peer to the suitors.<u>[3]</u> That is the kind of detail that, like an Easter-egg in computer-code, the *Odyssey* can playfully insert in its narrative for the delight of a tuned-in external audience. Such tricks are also typical of Odysseus’ lies, in that they tell a deeper truth, but only to those in the know, like the name he gives himself in the Cyclops episode (both ‘no one’ and ‘cunning’), or the story in the speech parallel to this one in Rhapsody 14 about the night raid he went on with Odysseus, when he forgot to wear a cloak.<u>[4]</u>


#### Footnotes


<u>[1]</u> See also *Homeric Hymn to Hermes* 108-133, where Hermes himself performs just such a sacrifice of his brother Apollo’s cattle.


<u>[2]</u> Dindorf 1885: II 614 on 15.319: the comment is on the words ‘because of Hermes’, and it says ‘because [he is a] herald (*kērux*).’ For the ascription of such a comment to Aristarchus, see E. Dickey 2007: p. 122, §4.1.44.


<u>[3]</u> On the concept of *ainos *‘coded message,’ see Verdenius 1962: 389 and Nagy 1999: 237-242, 12§17-12§21, citing Jakobson 1960.


<u>[4]</u> That story is in fact qualified as an *ainos*; for more, see Muellner 1976 p. 97 n.43, [https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_MuellnerL.The_Meaning_of_Homeric_eukhomai.1976](https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_MuellnerL.The_Meaning_of_Homeric_eukhomai.1976)<u>** **and </u>Dué and Ebbott 2010: commentary on Iliad 10.149, [https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_Due_Ebbott.Iliad_10_and_the_Poetics_of_Ambush.2010](https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_Due_Ebbott.Iliad_10_and_the_Poetics_of_Ambush.2010); see also H. Roisman 1990, who argues that Eumaios and Odysseus recognize each other but without admitting it overtly to each other until the right time.


<u>[1]</u> For the meaning of *endukeōs*, see the comment on 7.256, G. Nagy, *A Sampling of Comments on *Odyssey* Rhapsody 7*, [https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/a-sampling-of-comments-on-odyssey-rhapsody-7/](https://classical-inquiries.chs.harvard.edu/a-sampling-of-comments-on-odyssey-rhapsody-7/) This formula is used to express strong affection between hosts and guests, including that between Odysseus and the goddess Kalypso, 7.256, which is erotic as well as emotional; it also implies correct ritual sequencing.


<u>[2]</u> For *purnon kai kotulēn* ‘bread and a cupful’ see 15.312, 17.12 and compare *Iliad* 22.494-495, where Hector’s orphaned son is imagined by his mother begging for a drink (again, *kotulēn*) that will not even moisten the roof of his mouth.


<u>[3]</u> On the nuances of the prologue and the whole speech, Muellner 1976: 96-97 =  [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_MuellnerL.The_Meaning_of_Homeric_eukhomai.1976](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:CHS_MuellnerL.The_Meaning_of_Homeric_eukhomai.1976).


<u>[4]</u> This epithet of Hermes, conventionally translated either ‘attendant’ or ‘messenger’, is the subject of a forthcoming article by Laura Massetti, who has published a new interpretation of another epithet of Hermes often associated with it, *Argeiphontēs*, in Massettti 2022. Her forthcoming work on *diaktoros* interprets it as meaning ‘whose brightness shines through the night,’ with parallels in Sanskrit to epithets of the fire god, Agni, for both names. The importance of the mastery of fire seems as relevant to this context as that of ‘attendant, ritual attendant’, which may be the surface meaning.

Here in *Odyssey* 24.46, the Achaeans cut their hair at the funeral of Achilles. This ritual gesture, GN argues, signals a symbolic transition from long-haired Achaeans to short-haired Greeks, corresponding to a transition from the heroic age to a post heroic-age. See H24H 14§26a. Commenting on the post-heroic era that follows the death of Achilles, the Ampelourgos says: οὐδὲ κομᾶν ἔτι μετὰ τὸν Ἀχιλλέα καλὸν ἡγούμενοι ‘no longer could they [= the Achaeans] consider it a beautiful thing to grow their hair long, once Achilles was gone’ (Philostratus *Hērōikos* 51.13). The wording connotes an aetiology, as if the death of Achilles were the single reason that explains why adult men of the post-heroic age no longer wore their hair long - except for such notable counter-examples as the Spartans. The wearing of long hair was a distinctive sign of pre-adult status. Even in the Iliad, the long hair of Achilles ostentatiously signals his pre-adult status, as we can see from the scene describing the funeral of Patroklos, where Achilles cuts off his long blond hair as he stands at the funeral pyre of his best friend (23.141). It is at this same place where the tumulus to be shared by Patroklos and Achilles will be built when the time comes for the funeral of Achilles himself (23.126). In this Homeric scene, as Achilles is standing on the heights of the promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his own body, he wistfully looks out over the seas of the outer Hellespont, fixing his gaze toward the far west, in the direction of his native land of Thessaly, and longing for the river Sperkheios that flows through that distant land: it was to the waters of that river, which he will never live to see again, that he had hoped to sacrifice his long hair after he came of age and was ready to cut it (23.142-153). But now Achilles cuts off his long hair prematurely and unseasonally as he stands there at the Asiatic promontory that will become the setting for the tumulus that houses his body (23.142). [See also GN HPC 166 = II§85.] And now the Achaean comrades of Achilles follow his example and likewise cut off their hair (23.135-136). So also in the wording that I have just highlighted from the *Hērōikos* of Philostratus, we see a reference to this ritual of coming of age: now that Achilles is dead, adult males of the future will be wearing their hair short, no longer long. It is as if all the ‘sons of the Achaeans’ were now ready to shift from pre-adult to adult status - now that Achilles is dead and buried. So, now, the *huies Akhaiōn*, ‘sons of the Achaeans’, as the Achaean warriors are regularly called in the Iliad (1.162 and so on) have reached a post-heroic maturity that inaugurates a post-heroic age.
