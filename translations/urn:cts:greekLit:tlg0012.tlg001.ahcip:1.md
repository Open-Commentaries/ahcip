[1] The anger [mênis] of Peleus' son Achilles, goddess, perform its song --
[2] disastrous anger that made countless sufferings [algos pl.] for the Achaeans, 
[3] and many steadfast lives [psukhê pl.; n:v.l. heads] it drove down to Hades,
[4] heroes' lives, but their selves [note needed about body vs. soul and identity] it made prizes for dogs
[5] and for all birds [n: v.l. a feast for birds], and the plan of Zeus was being fulfilled [telos] --
[6] sing starting from the point where the two first clashed [eris],
[7] the son of Atreus, lord of men, and radiant Achilles.
[8] So, which of the gods was it that pushed the two to clash [eris] and fight?
[9] It was the son of Leto and Zeus. Infuriated [kholos] at the king,
[10] he stirred up an evil pestilence throughout the mass of warriors, and the warriors kept on dying,
[11] because Chrysês [n:Chrysês is the name of the man; Chryse is the name of the city], the one who prays and curses, was dishonored [timê]
[12] by the son of Atreus. For Chrysês came to the swift ships of the Achaeans
[13] to get his daughter's release, bringing with him a ransom [apoina] beyond telling, [n:=I-1.372]
[14] holding in his hands the suppliant wreaths of far-shooting Apollo [n:=I-1.373]
[15] wound around a golden scepter, and he supplicated all the Achaeans, 
[16] but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who marshal the warriors. 
[17] "Sons of Atreus and you other well-greaved Achaeans,
[18] may the gods who possess homes on Olympus grant to you 
[19] that you destroy the city [polis] of Priam and that you have a good homecoming;
[20] but you, release to me my dear [philê] daughter, and accept a ransom [apoina], 
[21] in awe of the son of Zeus, far-shooting Apollo." 
[22] At this point all the other Achaeans voiced their assent,
[23] to show respect [aidôs] to the priest [hiereus] and to accept the splendid ransom; 
[24] but this was not pleasing to the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, in his heart [thumos].
[25] Instead, dismissing him -- a bad thing to do -- he set in motion overpowering words [muthos]:
[26] "Don't let me find you, old man, near the hollow ships, 
[27] either lingering now or coming back again later.
[28] The scepter and the wreath of the god will not help you.
[29] I will not release her. Before that happens, old age will come to her
[30] in my house at Argos, far away from her ancestral home, 
[31] going to the upright loom and coming to my bed.
[32] So go, don't provoke me, or you won't get home safely." 
[33] So he spoke, and the old man was frightened and heeded the words [muthos]. 
[34] He went in silence along the shore of the resounding sea.
[35] Then, moving apart from the rest, the old man prayed intensely
[36] to lord Apollo, to whom Leto with beautiful hair gave birth. 
[37] "Hear me, you with the silver bow, you who stand over Chrysê 
[38] and holy Killa and lord over Tenedos with might, 
[39] Apollo Smintheus, if I have [n:augment] ever built a temple pleasing [kharis] to you all the way to the top,
[40] or if ever I have [n:augment] burned for you fat thigh-pieces 
[41] of bulls and goats, bring to fulfillment this wish for me:
[42] Let the Danaans [n:Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives are synonyms] pay for my tears with your arrows." 
[43] So he spoke praying, and Phoebus Apollo heard him,
[44] and he came down from the heights of Olympus, furious in his heart.
[45] On his shoulders he had a bow and a covered quiver, 
[46] and the arrows made a noise on his shoulders, furious as he was,
[47] as his body moved; and he came looking like the night [n:v.l. wrapped up in the night].
[48] Then he sat apart from the ships and let loose an arrow.
[49] Terrible was the noise from the silver bow.
[50] First he went after the mules and the keen hounds,
[51] and then he let fly a sharp arrow at the people themselves, 
[52] and he was hitting them; without end the pyres of the dead kept on burning, one after another.
[53] Nine days the arrows of the god went throughout the mass of warriors, 
[54] and on the tenth day Achilles called the warriors together to assembly,
[55] for the white-armed goddess Hera put it in his heart [phrên pl.]; 
[56] for she was worried [kêdos] about the Danaans, because she saw them dying continually.
[57] So when they came to assembly and were assembled together, 
[58] swift-footed Achilles stood up among them and spoke, 
[59] "Son of Atreus, I guess that now, set back and driven off course, 
[60] we really will return home [nostos] -- if we manage to escape death at least --
[61] seeing that war and plague together are subduing the Achaeans.
[62] But come, let us ask some seer [mantis] or priest [hiereus]
[63] or even a diviner of dreams -- in fact a dream is also from Zeus --
[64] who could say why Phoebus Apollo has become so furious [n:augment], 
[65] whether he finds fault with a prayer or a hecatomb [note on what this is],
[66] in the hope that somehow, when the savor of lambs and perfect goats 
[67] reaches him, he may want to ward off devastation for us." 
[68] So he spoke and sat down. Then stood up among them [=I-1.101, I-2.76, I-7.354, I-7.365]
[69] Calchas, son of Thestor, best [aristos] by far among diviners of birds,
[70] who knew things that are, things that will be, and things that were before.
[71] He guided the ships of the Achaeans to Ilion [n:Ilion is a synonym of Troy], 
[72] through his skill as a seer [mantis], which Phoebus Apollo gave him. 
[73] With good intentions [phrên] toward them, he spoke in assembly and said,
[74] "Achilles, you call on me, you who are dear to Zeus, to speak about [muthos]
[75] the anger [mênis] of lord Apollo, the far-shooter. 
[76] So I will speak, but I want you to understand and swear to me
[77] that hereby you will readily protect me with words [epos] and with force of hands.
[78] I am guessing that I will really infuriate [kholos] the man who has great power over all
[79] the Argives [n:Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives are synonyms] in his dominance [kratos], and the Achaeans heed him.
[80] A king has more power when he gets infuriated at a weaker man.
[81] For even if he swallows and nurses his fury [kholos] today,
[82] in the future he will still have a grudge [kotos], until he brings it to fulfillment [telos],
[83] keeping it inside his breast. But you, consider [n:v.l. tell] whether you are willing to save me [sôzô].
[84] Swift-footed Achilles answered him and said,
[85] "Be very bold and tell whatever divine sign you know.
[86] For I swear by Apollo, dear [philos] to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas,
[87] pray, and you bring to light the divine signs for the Danaans,
[88] that no one while I am alive on earth and have eyes to see
[89] will set heavy hands on you near the hollow ships,
[90] not a single one of all the Danaans, not even if you mean Agamemnon,
[91] who now boasts that he is best [aristos] by far of the Achaeans."
[92] At that point, the faultless seer [mantis] became bold and said,
[93] "The god does not find fault with a prayer or a hecatomb.
[94] It is about the man who prays and curses, whom Agamemnon has [n:augment] dishonored [timê] --
[95] he has [n:augment] not released his daughter and has [n:augment] not accepted a ransom [apoina] for her.
[96] For this reason the far-shooter has [n:augment] given these sufferings [algos pl.], and will give still more, 
[97] and he will not keep away the heavy hands of plague [n:v.l. and he will not push away hideous devastation for the Danaans]
[98] until Agamemnon gives back the girl with the dancing eyes [needs note in commentary] to her dear [philos] father
[99] without price or ransom, and drives a sacred hecatomb of cattle 
[100] to Chryse. At that point, we might appease and persuade him."
[101] So he spoke and sat down. Then stood up among them
[102] the hero, son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon,
[103] and he was aggrieved [akhos]. His heart [phrên pl.] became black with anger [menos], 
[104] full of rage [menos], and his two eyes looked like glowing fire.
[105] Giving an evil look first of all to Calchas, he spoke,
[106] "Seer [mantis] of evil, you have [n:augment] never yet told me what is real.
[107] Prophesying [mantis] evil things is endlessly dear [philos] to your heart [phrên],
[108] but you have [n:augment] never yet spoken a good [esthlos] word [epos] nor seen it to fulfillment [telos].
[109] Now once again you come giving divine signs, speaking in assembly among the Danaans, 
[110] saying that for this reason the far-shooter makes sufferings for them, 
[111] that the splendid ransom [apoina] for the daughter of Chrysês
[112] I was not willing to accept, since I want very much
[113] to keep her at home. In fact, I have come to prefer her to Clytemnestra, 
[114] the bride of my youth, since she is not inferior to her
[115] in build or physique, or in feeling [phrên pl.] or skills. 
[116] But even so I am willing to give her back, if that is better. 
[117] I do want the warriors to be safe [sôzô], and not perish. 
[118] Now prepare for me immediately a prize [geras], so that I alone
[119] of the Argives will not be without a prize [geras], since that doesn't look good.
[120] For you all see this, that my prize [geras] is going somewhere else."
[121] Then swift-footed radiant Achilles answered him, 
[122] "Son of Atreus, most glorious [kudos], avaricious beyond all mankind, 
[123] how in the world will the great-hearted [thumos] Achaeans give you another prize [geras]? 
[124] We don't know of many common possessions stored anywhere.
[125] The things we plundered from the cities [polis], those have been distributed,
[126] and it wouldn't look good for the warriors to gather up those things and collect them again.
[127] But you now, send forth this girl for the god, and then we Achaeans
[128] will pay you back three and four times over, if in fact Zeus
[129] gives us the well-walled city [polis] of Troy to destroy."
[130] The ruler Agamemnon answered him and said,
[131] "Don't you try, valiant [agathos] though you are, godlike Achilles,
[132] to be deceptive in intention [noos]. You won't get ahead of me or convince me. 
[133] Are you really willing, so that you can hold on to your prize [geras], to let me
[134] sit here deprived like this, and are you telling me to give this girl back? 
[135] Well, if the great-hearted [thumos] Achaeans give me a prize [geras]
[136] fit to my liking [thumos], to be of matching value... 
[137] But if they won't give it, then I might get one myself, 
[138] going for either your prize [geras] or Ajax's, or Odysseus's 
[139] I will seize it and drive it off; and whichever man I come to, he will be furious [kholos].
[140] But we certainly can think these things over later on.
[141] At the moment, we must drag a dark ship into the radiant sea,
[142] and in it put rowers as needed, and on it let a hecatomb 
[143] be placed, and onboard it the fine-cheeked daughter of Chrysês 
[144] will step. Some man of rank, one who can call a council, should be in charge,
[145] either Ajax or Idomeneus or radiant Odysseus,
[146] or even you, son of Peleus, most shocking of all men, 
[147] so that you can make sacrifices and appease on our behalf the one who works from afar [=Apollo]." 
[148] Then swift-footed Achilles gave him a fierce look and addressed him, 
[149] "Unbelievable! you are clothed in shamelessness, and your wily heart [phrên] is set on profit [n:I-4.339].
[150] How could any of the Achaeans readily be persuaded by your words [epos], 
[151] either to come in the first place or to fight mightily with men? 
[152] I did not come here on account of Trojan spearmen, 
[153] to fight them, since they are not at all responsible [aitios] as far as I'm concerned.
[154] They have [n:augment] never driven off my cattle, not to mention my horses,
[155] and never in fertile Phthia that nourishes men 
[156] have [n:augment] they destroyed my crops, since many things lie between us,
[157] shadowy mountains and echoing sea. 
[158] But we have accompanied you, you shameless man, just to please [kharis] you,
[159] striving to get honor [timê] for Menelaos and for you, dog eyes,
[160] from the Trojans. Not one of these things do you regard or care about; [n:v.l. Zen. did not read]
[161] in fact, you threaten that you will take away my prize [geras] yourself,
[162] the prize for which I toiled much, and which the sons of the Achaeans gave me.
[163] I never have a prize [geras] equal to yours, anytime [n:v.l. not even when, Zen.] the Achaeans 
[164] destroy a [n: the, if variant in 163 is accepted] well placed citadel of the Trojans.
[165] But the greater part of quick-moving war
[166] my hands tend to; yet once the moment of distribution comes
[167] you get the greater prize [geras] by far, and I with a smaller but dear [philon] one
[168] go back to the ships, when [n:v.l. whenever] I am worn out from making war.
[169] Now I am going to Phthia, since it's really much better
[170] to go home with the curved ships, and I do not think that for you
[171] I will serve up wealth and riches while I am dishonored [timê] here." 
[172] Then lord of men Agamemnon answered him,
[173] "Go ahead, run away, if your heart [thumos] is in a rush [n:v.l. desires]. I am not
[174] supplicating you to stay for my sake. There are others on my side
[175] who will honor [timê] me, and most of all Zeus the deviser [mêtis]. 
[176] You are most hateful to me of the kings nurtured by the gods.
[177] Strife [eris] and wars and fights are always dear [philos] to you. [=I-5.891]
[178] If you're so strong, some god must have given this to you.
[179] Go home with your ships and your comrades, 
[180] go be lord over the Myrmidons, I don't care about you,
[181] and I pay no attention to you and your grudge [kotos]. Here is my threat to you:
[182] Since Phoebus Apollo deprives me of the daughter of Chrysês,
[183] her I will send back with my ship and my comrades.
[184] I'll send her, but I am taking the fine-cheeked daughter of Briseus,
[185] your prize [geras], going in person to your tent, so that you know well
[186] how much I am superior to you, and any other man may shrink
[187] to speak as my equal and liken himself to me face to face."
[188] So he spoke. Anguish [akhos] came over the son Peleus, and his heart within
[189] his shaggy breast was divided
[190] whether he should draw his sharp sword from alongside his thigh, 
[191] make the rest get up and slay the son of Atreus
[192] or whether he should check his fury [kholos] and restrain his heart [thumos].
[193] While he was pondering in his mind [phrên] and heart [thumos],
[194] and he was drawing the great sword from its scabbard, Athena came
[195] from the sky. For the white-armed goddess Hera sent her forth,
[196] loving and caring [kêdos] for them both alike in her heart [thumos].
[197] She stood behind him, and grabbed the son of Peleus by his golden hair,
[198] appearing only to him. None of the others saw her.
[199] Achilles was amazed, turned around, and immediately recognized
[200] Pallas Athena. Terrible was the shining of her eyes.
[201] He spoke out and addressed to her winged words [epos]
[202] "Why have you come this time, child of aegis-shaking Zeus?
[203] To see the outrage [hubris] done by Agamemnon, son of Atreus?
[204] But I will speak out to you, and I think this will be fulfilled [telos].
[205] By his own acts of outrage, sometime soon he might lose his life [thumos]."
[206] Now the owl-radiant goddess Athena addressed him,
[207] "I came to stop your rage [menos], if you will be persuaded,
[208] down from the sky. For the white-armed goddess Hera sent me forth
[209] loving and caring [kêdos] for you both alike in her heart [thumos].
[210] But come, stop clashing [eris] with him, don't draw your sword with your hand; 
[211] instead, insult him with words [epos], telling him how it will be.
[212] Now I, too, will speak out, and it will be a thing fulfilled [telos].
[213] At some point you will have three times as many shining gifts
[214] because of this outrage [hubris]. But hold back, and be persuaded by us."
[215] Swift-footed Achilles answered and said,
[216] "One ought to keep to what you two say [epos], goddess,
[217] even when so infuriated [kholos] at heart [thumos]. It is better that way.
[218] Whoever is persuaded by the gods, the gods hear him."
[219] He spoke, and he stopped his firm hand on the silver handle,
[220] thrust the great sword back into the scabbard, and did not disobey
[221] the words [muthos] of Athena. But she was gone to Olympus
[222] to the home of aegis-shaking Zeus to join the other gods [daimôn].
[223] The son of Peleus once again with harmful words [epos]
[224] addressed the son of Atreus and did not yet cease from fury.
[225] "You drunkard, with a dog's eyes and a deer's heart,
[226] whenever it comes to arming yourself for war with the rest of the warriors [laos]
[227] or going on an ambush with the champions of the Achaeans,
[228] you don't have the heart [thumos] for it. That looks like death to you.
[229] It's much better throughout the massed expanse of Achaean warriors 
[230] to take away gifts from anyone who talks back to you.
[231] There you are, a king fattening himself on his people, and you are lord over worthless nobodies.
[232] This could be the last time, son of Atreus, that you outrage someone.
[233] But I will speak out and, more than that, I will swear a great oath:
[234] I swear by this scepter--never will leaves and branches
[235] sprout from it, now that it has left behind its stump in the mountains,
[236] nor will it bloom again. For a bronze ax has stripped it of
[237] leaves and bark. But now the sons of the Achaeans
[238] carry it in their hands when each offers judgment, and the ordinances [themis]
[239] from Zeus are kept by them. This will be a great oath.
[240] Some day a longing [pothê] for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans, 
[241] all of them together. But at that point [n:reading of Aristarchus, v.l. tois = "them"] you will not be able, even though in great sorrow, 
[242] to help it [n:v.l. delete "it" if v.l. in 241 is accepted], when many men at the hands of man-slaying Hektor 
[243] fall dying. And you will tear your heart out inside, 
[244] angry because you did not honor the best [aristos] of the Achaeans." 
[245] So spoke the son of Peleus and he threw the scepter to the ground, 
[246] the scepter pierced with golden nails, and he himself sat down.
[247] Opposite him the son of Atreus raged [mênis]. Among them Nestor
[248] the man of sweet words [epos] sprang up, the clear-voiced [ligus] speaker of the Pylians,
[249] from whose tongue the voice flowed sweeter than honey.
[250] In his lifetime already two generations of mortal men 
[251] had perished, those who were raised and born with him before 
[252] in holy Pylos, and he lorded over the third one.
[253] With good intentions towards all he addressed the assembly and spoke among them
[254] "What?! I see a great anguish [penthos] coming over the Achaean land.
[255] I can just see Priam and the sons of Priam rejoicing
[256] and the others Trojans being greatly pleased in their hearts [thumos]
[257] if they found out about you two fighting over all these things --
[258] you who excel among the Danaans in planning and fighting.
[259] But be persuaded. You two are both younger than I am.
[260] In the past with even better men than you [n: v.l. us]
[261] I kept company, and those men, at least, never slighted me.
[262] I never saw such men, nor am I likely to see
[263] men like Perithoos and Dryas, who shepherded the warriors,
[264] Kaineus and Exadios and Polyphemos, a match for the gods,
[265] and Theseus son of Aegeus, who looked like the immortals. [n: bracketed in most texts]
[266] Most powerful [kratos] were those of men raised on earth,
[267] most powerful [kratos] they were and they fought with the most powerful [kratos],
[268] with mountain-dwelling beasts, and it was shocking the way they destroyed them.
[269] I went from Pylos and joined their throng
[270] from faraway, coming from a distant land; they called for me.
[271] And I fought on my own, single-handed. Against those beasts no one
[272] of mortals now raised on earth would fight.
[273] The warriors heeded my counsels and were persuaded by my words [muthos].
[274] So you, too, be persuaded -- it's better to be persuaded.
[275] But you, valiant though you are, don't you go taking the girl away from this man,
[276] let her be, as a prize [geras] the way the sons of the Achaeans first gave her to him,
[277] and you, son of Peleus, don't wish to clash [eris] with a king
[278] with matching might, since never is there the same share of honor allotted
[279] to a scepter-bearing king, to whom Zeus grants [n:augment] radiant glory [kudos].
[280] If you are powerful [kratos], a goddess mother bore you; 
[281] but he is superior, since he lords over more. 
[282] But you, son of Atreus, put a stop to your rage [menos] -- I 
[283] supplicate you to let go of your fury [kholos] at Achilles, who for all 
[284] the Achaeans is a great wall against evil war."
[285] The ruler Agamemnon answered him and said, 
[286] "Of course, as far as all of that goes, old man, you have spoken [n:augment] in good measure [moira].
[287] But this man wants to be above everyone,
[288] he wants to be powerful over everyone, he wants to be lord over everyone,
[289] he wants to give the signal [sêma] to everyone, which I don't think anyone will be persuaded to obey.
[290] If the gods who are forever made him a spearman, 
[291] does that mean they give him permission to utter [muthos] insults at us?"
[292] Radiant Achilles took his turn and answered him,
[293] "I would certainly be called a coward and a worthless nobody
[294] if I yield to you and do everything you say.
[295] Give these commands to others, not to me,
[296] don't give me signals [sêma]; I don't think I will be persuaded to obey you any longer.
[297] I'll tell you something else, and you put it in your mind [phrên]. [n:=I-4.39, I-5.259, I-9.611, I-16.444, I-16.851, I-21.94]
[298] I, at least, will not fight you with the force of my hands for the girl,
[299] neither you nor anyone else, now that you all who gave her have taken her away from me. [n:v.l. since you want to take her away, Zen.] 
[300] As for the other things which I have next to my swift black ship,
[301] none of it could you pick up and carry off against my will.
[302] Just go ahead and try. That way all these people too will find out.
[303] Right away your dark blood will spurt around the point of my spear."
[304] So the two fought with words [epos] that match might for might,
[305] and they both stood up, dissolving the assembly beside the ships of the Achaeans.
[306] The son of Peleus heading for the tents and balanced ships
[307] set out with the son of Menoitios and his comrades.
[308] But the son of Atreus began dragging a swift ship down to the sea,
[309] for it he picked out twenty rowers, and in it a hecatomb
[310] for the god he placed, and on it the fine-cheeked daughter of Chrysês
[311] he led and seated. Odysseus, who is crafty in many ways, went aboard as leader.
[312] Then they went aboard and sailed over the waterways,
[313] and the son of Atreus ordered the warriors to purify themselves.
[314] Each one purified himself and threw the impurities into the sea;
[315] they sacrificed to Apollo perfect hecatombs 
[316] of bulls and goats along the shore of the rumbling sea.
[317] The savor reached the sky swirling around the smoke.
[318] So they were busy with these things throughout the mass of warriors. Nor did Agamemnon
[319] leave off from the strife [eris] which he had first threatened [n:augment] against Achilles
[320] but he addressed Talthybios and Eurybates,
[321] the two who were his heralds and alert attendants [therapôn],
[322] "Both of you, go to the tent of Peleus' son Achilles.
[323] Seize the fine-cheeked daughter of Briseus by the hand and bring her here.
[324] If he does not give her, I myself will seize her,
[325] and I'll come with more men. That will be even more chilling for him."
[326] So he spoke and sent them forth, setting in motion his overpowering words [muthos].
[327] The two of them went unwillingly along the shore of the rumbling sea,
[328] and the two of them came to the tents and ships of the Myrmidons.
[329] They found him beside his tent and black ship,
[330] sitting there. You could tell that Achilles was not happy to see the two of them.
[331] The two were afraid and in awe [aidôs] of the king,
[332] and they stood there. They did not speak out to him at all nor ask any questions.
[333] But he understood in his heart [phrên] and spoke out,
[334] "Welcome [kharis] to you, heralds, mediators sacred to Zeus and men [n: genitive conveys idea of protection, Odyssey parallel],
[335] come closer: you are not at all responsible [aitios] in my eyes, but Agamemnon is,
[336] who sent you two forth for the daughter of Briseus.
[337] But come, Patroklos descended from the gods, bring the girl out
[338] and give her to these two to take away. Let the two of them themselves be eyewitnesses
[339] in the sight of the blessed gods and mortal men
[340] and in the sight of that aloof king, if ever again
[341] there is a need for me to ward off hideous devastation
[342] for the others: I swear, he is raging with his destructive mind [phrên]
[343] and he doesn't at all know how to take note of what comes before and what comes after
[344] so that the Achaeans fight in safety beside the ships."
[345] So he spoke, and Patroklos was persuaded to obey his dear [philos] comrade.
[346] He led out from the tent the fine-cheeked daughter of Briseus,
[347] and he gave her to them to lead away. The two of them went back beside the ships of the Achaeans.
[348] The woman went together with them against her will. And then Achilles,
[349] weeping, at once withdrew far from his comrades and sat
[350] on the shore of the gray sea, looking out upon the boundless [n:v.l. that reflects like wine] expanse [pontos].
[351] He prayed intensely to his dear [philê] mother raising up his hands.
[352] "Mother, since you bore me, although for only a short life,
[353] the Olympian ought to secure me honor [timê],
[354] Zeus who thunders on high. But now he has honored [n:augment] me not even a little.
[355] I swear, the son Atreus, wide ruling Agamemnon
[356] has dishonored [n:augment] me. For he seized my prize [geras] and keeps her, having taken her away himself." [n:=I-1.507, I-2.240]
[357] So he spoke, shedding tears, and his revered mother heard him
[358] sitting in the depths of the sea beside the old man, her father.
[359] Quickly she emerged from the gray sea like a mist
[360] and she sat before him as he shed tears,
[361] and she caressed him with her hand, and spoke a word [epos] and called out his name,
[362] "Child, why do you lament? What sorrow [penthos] has come upon your heart [phrên]?
[363] Speak out, don't hide it in your mind [noos], so that we may both know."
[364] Groaning deeply swift-footed Achilles addressed her,
[365] "You know. Why should I tell you when you know all these things?
[366] We went to Thebe, the sacred city [polis] of Eetion;
[367] we utterly ravaged it and we brought everything here.
[368] The sons of the Achaeans properly divided everything else among themselves 
[369] but they picked out for the son of Atreus the fine-cheeked daughter of Chrysês.
[370] But then Chrysês, the priest [hiereus] of far-shooting Apollo
[371] came to the swift ships of the bronze-khitoned Achaeans
[372] to get his daughter's release, bringing with him a ransom [apoina] beyond telling, [n:=I-1.13]
[373] holding in his hands the suppliant wreaths of far-shooting Apollo [n:=I-1.14]
[374] wound around a golden scepter, and he supplicated all the Achaeans, [n:=I-1.15]
[375] but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who marshal the warriors. [n:=I-1.16]
[376] At this point all the other Achaeans voiced their assent [n:=I-1.22]
[377] to show respect [aidôs] to the priest [hiereus] and to accept the splendid ransom; [n:=I-1.23]
[378] but this was not pleasing to the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, in his heart [thumos]. [n:=I-1.24]
[379] Instead, dismissing him -- a bad thing to do -- he set in motion overpowering words [muthos]. [n:=I-1.25]
[380] The old man went back angry, and him Apollo
[381] heard praying, since he was very dear [philos] to him.
[382] Apollo let loose an evil arrow at the Argives. And the warriors
[383] were dying one after the other. The arrows of the god went after them
[384] everywhere throughout the massed expanse of Achaean warriors. To us the seer [mantis]
[385] who understands them well announced in assembly the divine signs of the far-shooter.
[386] Immediately I was the first to bid them to appease the god.
[387] But then fury [kholos] seized the son of Atreus, and right away he stood up
[388] and spoke threatening words [muthos], and, now I see, they have come to fulfillment [telos]. [n: Bakker's explanation that dê is when the speaker sees something for the first time]
[389] For now the one girl the Achaeans with the dancing eyes with a swift ship
[390] are escorting to Chrysê, and they are bringing gifts to the lord [Apollo].
[391] The other girl just now heralds went and led from the tent,
[392] the daughter of Briseus, the one the sons of the Achaeans gave me.
[393] But you, if you have the power, stand by a worthy child [n:v.l. your child].
[394] Go to Olympus and supplicate Zeus, if ever at any time
[395] you enriched the heart of Zeus either by word [epos] or also by deed.
[396] For many times in the halls of my father I heard you
[397] making a solemn statement; you said about the dark-clouded son of Kronos
[398] that you alone among the immortals warded off hideous devastation for him
[399] when the other Olympians wanted to bind him,
[400] Hera and also Poseidon and Pallas Athena [n:v.l. Phoebus Apollo].
[401] But you, goddess, in this instance went and released him from the bonds;
[402] quickly you summoned the hundred-hander to tall Olympus.
[403] The gods call him "Briareos," but all men
[404] say "Aigaion" -- in his own right he is better in might [biê] than his father -- [n:v.l. the one who is by far the best in might [biê] among all those who inhabit dank Tartaros below]
[405] and he sat at the side of the son of Kronos glorying in his radiance [kudos: note Aigaiôn and kudei gaiôn].
[406] At the sight of him the blessed gods froze with fear and stopped binding him [n: rhyming hupedeisan and oud' et edêsan].
[407] Now is the time to remind him of these things: sit at his side and take hold of his knees,
[408] to ask if in any way he would be willing to give aid to the Trojans
[409] and to hem in the Achaeans along the sterns, up against the sea.
[410] As they are being killed, then they will enjoy the benefits of their king,
[411] and even the son of Atreus wide ruling Agamemnon will recognize
[412] his own derangement [atê], in that in no way has [n:augment] he honored the best of the Achaeans." [n:cf. I-1.244]
[413] Then Thetis answered him shedding a tear,
[414] "Oh my child, what woes I have had in raising you since the moment I bore you.
[415] If only you were beside the ships without tears and without pain, 
[416] sitting there, since the measure of your lifetime [aisa] is very short, not at all long.
[417] But as it is now a swift death and misery beyond all others
[418] has come to be your fate. That is why I say your measure of life was wretched from the moment I bore you in the halls.
[419] In order to say this word [epos] on your behalf to Zeus who delights in thunder
[420] I myself will go to snowy Olympus to see if he will be persuaded.
[421] But, you now, sit beside the swift-traversing ships
[422] and continue your anger [mênis] at the Achaeans, and cease from war entirely.
[423] Zeus went to Okeanos among the faultless Aithiopians,
[424] he went yesterday for a feast, and all the gods accompanied him.
[425] On the twelfth day he will come back to Olympus,
[426] and then at that time, I will go to the bronze-paved house of Zeus,
[427] and I will take hold of his knees, and I think he will be persuaded to obey."
[428] So she spoke and went away. She left him there,
[429] furious in his heart [thumos] over the woman with the beautiful waist,
[430] the one whom they took away by force [biê] against his will. Meanwhile Odysseus
[431] arrived at Chrysê bringing the sacred hecatomb.
[432] When they arrived inside the very deep harbor,
[433] they took down the sails and placed them in the black ship;
[434] lowering the mast with the ropes, they made it lie flat against the deck
[435] and they were quick about it; then they rowed the ship with the oars to the anchoring place.
[436] They threw overboard the anchor-stones, and they tied down the stern cables.
[437] They got out where the waves of the sea break,
[438] and they moved out the hecatomb for far-shooting Apollo.
[439] Then the daughter of Chrysês got out of the ship that traverses the sea.
[440] Next, leading her to the sacrificial altar, Odysseus who is crafty in many ways
[441] placed her in her dear father's hands and addressed him.
[442] "Chrysês, I have been sent by lord of men Agamemnon 
[443] to lead your child back to you, and as for Apollo, to perform for him a sacred hecatomb,
[444] performing it on behalf of the Danaans, in order that we may appease the lord Apollo [n:v.l. Aristarchus athetized 444],
[445] who has now let fly [n:augment] at the Argives cares [kêdos] that bring many laments." 
[446] So he spoke and placed her in his hands, and Chrysês received with pleasure [kharis] 
[447] his dear child. Quickly the famous [n: v.l. sacred] hecatomb for the god [n: v.l. 446-447 So he spoke. Quickly the sacred hecatomb for the god, Zen.]
[448] was set up in due order around the well-built sacrificial altar.
[449] Next they washed their hands and they took up handfuls of barley for sprinkling, 
[450] while Chrysês lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on their behalf.
[451] "Hear me, you with the silver bow, you who stand over Chrysê [n:=I-1.37]
[452] and holy Killa and lord over Tenedos with might, [n:=I-1.38]
[453] You have [n:augment] already heard me once before when I prayed [n:v.l. via scholia I-18.75, cf. 16.236 and 14.234].
[454] You honored [timê] me, and you greatly harmed the warriors of the Achaeans.
[455] So also now bring to fulfillment this wish for me: [n:cf. I-1.41, =16.238]
[456] ward off this hideous devastation for the Danaans."
[457] So he spoke praying, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. [n:=I-1.43]
[458] Then when they had prayed and sprinkled handfuls of barley [n: on the sacrificial cattle],
[459] they drew back the heads and cut the throats and skinned them.
[460] They cut out the thigh-bones and covered them with fat,
[461] placing the fat over and under, and they placed raw meat on top of them.
[462] The old man was roasting them over the wood, and over them blazing wine
[463] was poured. The young men beside him held five-pronged forks in their hands.
[464] Then when the thigh-pieces were burnt up and they had shared the entrails,
[465] they chopped the rest of the meat and pierced it with spits, 
[466] and they roasted it with care and drew everything off the spits.
[467] Then when they finished the work [ponos] and had made the feast,
[468] they feasted, and not a soul [thumos] lacked his fair share.
[469] Then when they had put away the desire for drink and food, 
[470] the young men topped off the mixing bowls with drink, 
[471] they handed out cups to everyone and made the first offerings with them.
[472] All day long they kept trying to appease the god with song and dance, 
[473] the young men of the Achaeans, singing a fine healing-song,
[474] singing and dancing for the one who works from afar [=Apollo]. He was delighted in his heart [phrên] when he heard it.
[475] When the sun set and darkness came on, 
[476] at that point they bedded down alongside the stern cables of the ship.
[477] When Eôs born at daybreak with her rosy steps appeared,
[478] then at that point they put to sea heading for the massed expanse of Achaean warriors.
[479] Apollo who works from afar sent them a wind that went their way.
[480] They raised the mast and spread the sails.
[481] The wind blew into the middle of the sail, and the wave around
[482] the prow surged and resounded loudly as the ship went.
[483] The ship was running along the wave as it made its way.
[484] When they reached the massed expanse of Achaean warriors,
[485] they dragged the black ship onto the shore
[486] up high on the sand, and underneath it they stretched out long supports.
[487] Then they themselves dispersed among the tents and ships.
[488] But he continued to be angry [mênis] sitting beside the swift-traversing ships,
[489] the son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles, descended from the gods.
[490] Not one time did he make his way to the assembly that confers radiant glory [kudos],
[491] not one time did he go to war, but he continually wasted away his dear [philos] heart
[492] waiting there, and he longed for the battle-cry and war.
[493] But when the twelfth dawn from that one arose
[494] at that point the gods who are forever went to Olympus,
[495] all of them together, and Zeus led the way. Thetis did not forget the requests 
[496] of her son. But she emerged from a wave of the sea
[497] and in a mist went up to the great sky and Olympus. 
[498] She found the far-seeing son of Kronos sitting apart from the others
[499] on the highest peak of Olympus with many ridges.
[500] There she was, seated in front of him, and she took hold of his knees
[501] with her left hand, and with her right she grasped him by the chin.
[502] Supplicating him, she addressed lord Zeus, son of Kronos.
[503] "Father Zeus, if ever among the immortals I helped you
[504] either in word [epos] or in deed, bring to fulfillment this wish for me.
[505] Honor [timê] my son, the most swift to meet his fate beyond all others
[506] who exist. But him now the lord of men Agamemnon
[507] has dishonored [n:augment]. For he seized his prize [geras] and keeps her, having taken her away himself. [n:=I-1.356, I-2.240]
[508] But you, Olympian Zeus the deviser [mêtis], honor him.
[509] Place power [kratos] on the Trojan side until the time when the Achaeans
[510] may honor my son and magnify him with honor [timê]."
[511] So she spoke. The cloud-gatherer Zeus did not address her at all,
[512] but sat in silence for a long time. Thetis, as she had grasped his knees,
[513] so clinging she kept on holding them, and she asked a second time:
[514] "Make me a promise that will not miss the mark and nod in assent,
[515] or refuse, since you have no reason to hesitate, so that I may know well
[516] how much I am the most dishonored god among all."
[517] Greatly troubled, the cloud-gatherer Zeus addressed her,
[518] "These will be devastating actions, and you will push me to be enemies 
[519] with Hera [n:Aristarchus has Hera in the nominative; check further], and she will provoke me with insulting words.
[520] Even as it is, among the immortal gods she without end
[521] quarrels with me, and she says that I protect the Trojans in battle.
[522] But you, now, go back again, and make sure you aren't [n: v.l. nothing is Ar.] noticed by --
[523] Hera. These matters will be my concern, until I bring them to fulfillment [telos].
[524] All right, then, I will nod in assent with my head to make you confident.
[525] For this from me among the immortals is the greatest
[526] final sign. For my assent is not revocable nor deceitful
[527] nor unfulfilled, whatever I nod with my head in assent to."
[528] So spoke the son of Kronos, and with his dark eyebrows he nodded in assent.
[529] Ambrosial locks cascaded from the lord's
[530] immortal head. And he made great Olympus shake.
[531] So the two of them [Zeus and Thetis] made their plans and parted company. She then
[532] dove back into the deep sea from gleaming Olympus,
[533] while Zeus headed back to his home. All the gods stood up at once
[534] from their seats before their father. Nor did any of them dare
[535] to stay seated when he came, but they all stood before him.
[536] So he sat down there on his chair. And him Hera
[537] did not fail to perceive. She saw that he had made plans with
[538] silver-stepping Thetis, the daughter of the old man of the sea.
[539] Immediately she addressed Zeus, son of Kronos, with taunting words:
[540] "Who of the gods made plans with you this time, devious deviser?
[541] It is endlessly dear to you when you are apart from me
[542] to think up secret plans and decide on them. Never yet to me
[543] have you readily dared to speak whatever word [epos] you think."
[544] Then the father of men and gods answered her,
[545] "Hera, when it comes to my pronouncements [muthos], don't expect
[546] to know them all. Even though you are my wife, it will be hard for you.
[547] Whichever one of my pronouncements is suitable for you to hear, not one
[548] of the gods or mortals will know it before you.
[549] But whichever of them I choose to devise [noos] apart from the gods,
[550] don't you ask and inquire about any one of these things."
[551] Then revered, ox-radiant Hera answered him,
[552] "Most terrible son of Kronos, what sort of words [muthos] have you spoken [n:augment]?
[553] Too often before I haven't asked or inquired,
[554] but all too undisturbed you devise whatever you want.
[555] Now I fear terribly in my mind [phrên] that she beguiles you,
[556] silver-stepping Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea.
[557] In a mist she was seated beside you and took hold of your knees.
[558] I think you nodded in true assent to her that Achilles
[559] you will honor and you will cause the destruction of many at the ships of the Achaeans."
[560] The cloud-gatherer Zeus answered and addressed her, [n:v.l. Venetus A: Greatly troubled, the cloud-gatherer Zeus addressed her, =I-1.517]
[561] "What possesses you [daimôniê]? You are always assuming, and nothing I do escapes you.
[562] In any case you won't be able to accomplish a thing, but more distant
[563] you will be from my heart [thumos]. That will be even more chilling for you. [n:cf. I-1.325]
[564] If this is the way it is, it must be what gives me pleasure [philos].
[565] So, sit down and be quiet, and be persuaded to obey my words [muthos].
[566] All the gods there are in Olympus won't help you
[567] when I come near [n:v.l. when you all come near], whenever I lay my terrifying hands upon you." [needs note that explains that the word means 'taboo' or 'unspeakable', but also connotes violence]
[568] So he spoke, and revered, ox-radiant Hera was frightened [n:cf I-1.33].
[569] She sat down and was quiet, bending her dear [philos] heart.
[570] Throughout the home of Zeus the Olympian gods were troubled.
[571] Among them, Hephaistos famed for his skill began to speak in assembly
[572] bearing goodwill to his dear [philos] mother, white-armed Hera.
[573] "Certainly these will be devastating actions, no longer endurable,
[574] if you two clash in this way because of mortals,
[575] setting off an uproar among the gods. Then in the noble [esthlos] feast
[576] there will be no pleasure taken, since what is low wins.
[577] I encourage my mother, even though she knows [noos] this already, 
[578] to bear goodwill to dear [philos] father Zeus, so that he doesn't once again
[579] start a quarrel and disrupt the feast for all of us.
[580] If in fact the Olympian who hurls the thunderbolt wants
[581] to knock us from our seats -- well, he is by far superior to all.
[582] But [n:resumptive alla'] you, check him with soft words.
[583] Immediately then, we will appease the Olympian."
[584] So he spoke, and leaping up he took a two-handled cup
[585] and placed it in the hand of his dear mother, and addressed her.
[586] "Be strong, mother, and put up with it even though you care [kêdos] very much.
[587] I don't want to witness with my own eyes you, dear as you are to me,
[588] getting hit. At that point I will not be able, even though in great sorrow, [n: cf. I-1.241-242]
[589] to help you. For the Olympian is painful to oppose.
[590] Already on another occasion when I was stirred to defend you,
[591] he threw me, grabbing me by the foot, from the divine threshold.
[592] I plummeted the whole day and then at sunset
[593] I landed on Lemnos, little life [thumos] still left in me.
[594] There the Sintian men at once rescued me when I fell."
[595] So he spoke, and the goddess white-armed Hera smiled,
[596] smiled and accepted the cup from her son with her hand.
[597] Then he for all the other gods, going from left to right,
[598] poured sweet nectar, serving it up from a mixing bowl.
[599] Unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods
[600] when they saw Hephaistos bustling through the house. 
[601] So then all day long until the sun set
[602] they feasted, and not a soul [thumos] lacked his fair share of the feast, [n:cf.I-1.468]
[603] or of the surpassingly beautiful lyre which Apollo was holding,
[604] or of the Muses who sang in responsion with beautiful voices.
[605] Then when the blazing light of the sun set
[606] the rest went each to his own house to lie down,
[607] where a house for each the far-famed, lame in both legs,
[608] Hephaistos had made with his knowing mind.
[609] But Zeus the Olympian who hurls the thunderbolt went to his own bed
[610] where he always slept whenever sweet sleep came over him.
[611] There he got into it and slept, and Hera of the golden throne was by his side.
