    <milestone n="1" unit="line"/>So here Odysseus slept, overcome by sleep and
    toil; but Athena went off to the <term xml:lang="grc">dêmos</term> and city of
    the Phaeacians - a people who used to live in the fair town of Hypereia, near
    the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes were stronger in force [<term xml:lang="grc">biê</term>] than they and plundered them, so their king
    Nausithoos moved them thence and settled them in <placeName key="tgn,7010886">Scheria</placeName>, far from all other people. He surrounded the city with
    a wall, built houses and temples, and divided the lands among his people; but
    he was dead and gone to the house of Hades, and King Alkinoos, whose counsels
    were inspired of heaven, was now reigning. To his house, then, did Athena go in
    furtherance of the return [<term xml:lang="grc">nostos</term>] of Odysseus.</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="15" unit="line"/>She went straight to the beautifully decorated
    bedroom in which there slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess, Nausicaa,
    daughter to King Alkinoos. Two maid servants were sleeping near her, both very
    pretty, one on either side of the doorway, which was closed with well-made
    folding doors. Athena took the form of the famous sea leader Dymas’ daughter,
    who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age; then, coming up to the
    girl's bedside like a breath of wind, she hovered over her head and said:</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="25" unit="line"/>"Nausicaa, what can your mother have been about,
    to have such a lazy daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder, yet
    you are going to be married almost immediately, and should not only be well
    dressed yourself, but should find good clothes for those who attend you. This
    is the way to get yourself a good name, and to make your father and mother
    proud of you. Suppose, then, that we make tomorrow a washing day, and start at
    daybreak. I will come and help you so that you may have everything ready as
    soon as possible, for all the best young men throughout your own <term xml:lang="grc">dêmos</term> are courting you, and you are not going to
    remain a young girl much longer. Ask your father, therefore, to have a wagon
    and mules ready for us at daybreak, to take the rugs, robes, and belts; and you
    can ride, too, which will be much pleasanter for you than walking, for the
    washing-cisterns are some way from the town."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="41" unit="line"/>When she had said this Athena went away to
    <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, which they say is the
    everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly, and neither rain nor
    snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine and in a great
    peacefulness of light, wherein the blessed gods are illumined for ever and
    ever. This was the place to which the goddess went when she had given
    instructions to the girl.</p>

    <milestone n="48" unit="line"/>By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa, who
    began wondering about her dream; she therefore went to the other end of the
    house to tell her father and mother all about it, and found them in their own
    room. Her mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her
    maids around her, and she happened to catch her father just as he was going out
    to attend a meeting of the town council, which the Phaeacian aldermen had
    convened. She stopped him and said:</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="57" unit="line"/>"Papa dear, could you manage to let me have a
    good big wagon? I want to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash
    them. You are the chief man here, so it is only right that you should have a
    clean shirt when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover, you have five
    sons at home, two of them married, while the other three are good-looking
    bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go to a
    dance [<term xml:lang="grc">khoros</term>], and I have been thinking about all
    this."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="66" unit="line"/>She did not say a word about her own wedding,
    for she did not like to, but her father knew and said, "You shall have the
    mules, my love, and whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you, and the
    men shall get you a good strong wagon with a body to it that will hold all your
    clothes."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="71" unit="line"/>On this he gave his orders to the servants, who
    got the wagon out, harnessed the mules, and put them to, while the girl brought
    the clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the wagon. Her mother
    prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good things, and a goat
    skin full of wine; the girl now got into the wagon, and her mother gave her
    also a golden cruse of oil, that she and her women might anoint themselves.
    Then she took the whip and reins and lashed the mules on, whereon they set off,
    and their hoofs clattered on the road. They pulled without flagging, and
    carried not only Nausicaa and her wash of clothes, but the maids also who were
    with her.</p>

    <milestone n="85" unit="line"/>When they reached the water side they went to
    the washing-cisterns, through which there ran at all times enough pure water to
    wash any quantity of linen, no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the
    mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the
    water side. They took the clothes out of the wagon, put them in the water, and
    vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get the dirt out. After
    they had washed them and got them quite clean, they laid them out by the sea
    side, where the waves had raised a high beach of shingle, and set about washing
    themselves and anointing themselves with olive oil. Then they got their dinner
    by the side of the stream, and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes.
    When they had done dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and
    began to play at ball, while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Artemis
    goes forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars or
    deer, and the wood-nymphs, daughters of Aegis-bearing Zeus, take their sport
    along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter stand a full head
    taller than the others, and eclipse the loveliest amid a whole bevy of
    beauties), even so did the girl outshine her handmaids.</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="110" unit="line"/>When it was time for them to start home, and
    they were folding the clothes and putting them into the wagon, Athena began to
    consider how Odysseus should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to
    conduct him to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl, therefore, threw a ball at
    one of the maids, which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they all
    shouted, and the noise they made woke Odysseus, who sat up in his bed of leaves
    and began to wonder what it might all be.</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="119" unit="line"/>"Alas," said he to himself, "what kind of
    people have I come amongst? Are they cruel, savage, and uncivilized [not <term xml:lang="grc">dikaios</term>], or hospitable and endowed with a god-fearing
    <term xml:lang="grc">noos</term>? I seem to hear the voices of young women,
    and they sound like those of the nymphs that haunt mountaintops, or springs of
    rivers and meadows of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and
    women. Let me try if I cannot manage to get a look at them."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="127" unit="line"/>As he said this he crept from under his bush,
    and broke off a bough covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He
    looked like some lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his
    strength and defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest
    of oxen, sheep, or deer, for he is famished, and will dare break even into a
    well-fenced homestead, trying to get at the sheep - even such did Odysseus seem
    to the young women, as he drew near to them all naked as he was, for he was in
    great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so begrimed with salt water, the
    others scampered off along the spits that jutted out into the sea, but the
    daughter of Alkinoos stood firm, for Athena put courage into her heart and took
    away all fear from her. She stood right in front of Odysseus, and he doubted
    whether he should go up to her, throw himself at her feet, and embrace her
    knees as a suppliant, or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some
    clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best to
    entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offense at his coming
    near enough to clasp her knees, so he addressed her in honeyed and persuasive
    language.</p>

    tell me, are you a goddess or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and
    dwell in heaven, I can only conjecture that you are Zeus’ daughter Artemis, for
    your face and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a
    mortal and live on earth, thrice happy are your father and mother - thrice
    happy, too, are your brothers and sisters; how proud and delighted they must
    feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself going out to a dance [<term xml:lang="grc">khoros</term>]; most happy, however, of all will he be whose
    wedding gifts have been the richest, and who takes you to his own home. I never
    yet saw any one so beautiful, neither man nor woman, and am lost in admiration
    as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young palm tree which I saw when I
    was at <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> growing near the altar
    of Apollo - for I was there, too, with many people after me, when I was on that
    journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet did such a
    young plant shoot out of the ground as that was, and I admired and wondered at
    it exactly as I now admire and wonder at yourself. I dare not clasp your knees,
    but I am in great distress [<term xml:lang="grc">penthos</term>]; yesterday
    made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the sea. The winds
    and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian island, and now a <term xml:lang="grc">daimôn</term> has flung me upon this coast that I may endure
    still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the end of
    it, but rather that the gods have still much evil in store for me.</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="175" unit="line"/>"And now, O queen, have pity upon me, for you
    are the first person I have met, and I know no one else in this country. Show
    me the way to your town, and let me have anything that you may have brought
    here to wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart's
    desire - husband, house, and a happy, peaceful home; for there is nothing
    better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a house.
    It discomfits their enemies, makes the hearts of their friends glad, and they
    themselves know more about it than any one."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="186" unit="line"/>To this Nausicaa answered, "Stranger, you
    appear to be a sensible, well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck;
    Zeus gives prosperity [<term xml:lang="grc">olbos</term>] to rich and poor just
    as he chooses, so you must take what he has seen fit to send you, and make the
    best of it. Now, however, that you have come to this our country, you shall not
    want for clothes nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may
    reasonably look for. I will show you the way to the town, and will tell you the
    name of our people: we are called Phaeacians, and I am daughter to Alkinoos, in

    take him for a robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here
    to do us Phaeacians any harm, for we are dear to the gods, and live apart on a
    land's end that juts into the sounding sea, and have nothing to do with any
    other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way, and we must be
    kind to him, for strangers and foreigners in distress are under Zeus’
    protection, and will take what they can get and be thankful; so, girls, give
    the poor man something to eat and drink, and wash him in the stream at some
    place that is sheltered from the wind."</p>

    began calling one another back. They made Odysseus sit down in the shelter as
    Nausicaa had told them, and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought
    him the little golden cruse of oil, and told him to go wash in the stream. But
    Odysseus said, "Young women, please to stand a little on one side that I may
    wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil, for it is long
    enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I cannot wash as long as
    you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to strip before a number of
    good-looking young women."</p>

    <milestone n="223" unit="line"/>Then they stood on one side and went to tell
    the girl, while Odysseus washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine
    from his back and from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed
    himself, and had got the brine out of his hair, he anointed himself with oil,
    and put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Athena then made him look
    taller and stronger than before, she also made the hair grow thick on the top
    of his head, and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms; she poured down
    gracefulness [<term xml:lang="grc">kharis</term>] over his head and shoulders
    as a skillful workman who has studied art of all kinds under Hephaistos and
    Athena enriches a piece of silver plate by gilding it - and his work is full of
    beauty. Then he went and sat down a little way off upon the beach, looking
    quite young and handsome [<term xml:lang="grc">kharis</term>], and the girl
    gazed on him with admiration; then she said to her maids:</p>

    <p>

    believe the gods who live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When
    I first saw him I thought him plain, but now his appearance is like that of the
    gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just such
    another as he is, if he would only stay here and not want to go away. However,
    give him something to eat and drink."</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="247" unit="line"/>They did as they were told, and set food before
    Odysseus, who ate and drank ravenously, for it was long since he had had food
    of any kind. Meanwhile, Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the
    linen folded and placed in the wagon, she then yoked the mules, and, as she
    took her seat, she called Odysseus:</p>

    back to the town; I will introduce you at the house of my excellent father,
    where I can tell you that you will meet all the best people among the
    Phaeacians. But be sure and do as I bid you, for you seem to be a sensible
    person. As long as we are going past the fields - and farm lands, follow
    briskly behind the wagon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.
    Presently, however, we shall come to the town, where you will find a high wall
    running all round it, and a good harbor on either side with a narrow entrance
    into the city, and the ships will be drawn up by the road side, for every one
    has a place where his own ship can lie. You will see the market place with a
    temple of Poseidon in the middle of it, and paved with large stones bedded in
    the earth. Here people deal in ship's gear of all kinds, such as cables and
    sails, and here, too, are the places where oars are made, for the Phaeacians
    are not a nation of archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows, but are a
    sea-faring folk, and pride themselves on their masts, oars, and ships, with
    which they travel far over the sea.</p>

    <p>
    <milestone n="273" unit="line"/>"I am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may
    be set on foot against me later on; for the people in the <term xml:lang="grc">dêmos</term> here are very ill-natured, and some lowly person, if he met
    us, might say, ‘Who is this fine-looking stranger that is going about with
    Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose she is going to marry him. Perhaps
    he is a vagabond sailor whom she has taken from some foreign vessel, for we
    have no neighbors; or some god has at last come down from heaven in answer to
    her prayers, and she is going to live with him all the rest of her life. It
    would be a better thing if she would take herself away and find a husband
    somewhere else, for she will not look at one of the many excellent young
    Phaeacians in the <term xml:lang="grc">dêmos</term> who woo her.’ This is the
    kind of disparaging remark that would be made about me, and I could not
    complain, for I should myself be scandalized at seeing any other girl do the
    like, and go about with men in spite of everybody, while her father and mother
    were still alive, and without having been married in the face of all the
    world.</p>

    an escort and to help you home [<term xml:lang="grc">nostos</term>], do as I
    bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by the road side dedicated
    to Athena; it has a well in it and a meadow all round it. Here my father has a
    field of fertile garden ground, about as far from the town as a man's voice
    will carry. Sit down there and wait for a while till the rest of us can get
    into the town and reach my father's house. Then, when you think we must have
    done this, come into the town and ask the way to the house of my father
    Alkinoos. You will have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it
    out to you, for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine
    house as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer court,
    go right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You will find her
    sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by firelight. It is a fine
    sight to see her as she leans back against one of the bearing-posts with her
    maids all ranged behind her. Close to her seat stands that of my father, on
    which he sits and topes like an immortal god. Never mind him, but go up to my
    mother, and lay your hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you
    can win her over, you may hope to see your own country again, no matter how
    distant it may be."</p>

    and they left the river. The mules drew well and their hoofs went up and down
    upon the road. She was careful not to go too fast for Odysseus and the maids
    who were following on foot along with the wagon, so she plied her whip with
    judgment [<term xml:lang="grc">noos</term>]. As the sun was going down they
